							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>How We Voted in 2024: New Data and Insights from the MIT Election Lab<br />
</strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus: Join the Lab’s founding director for a deep dive on the data next week</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the</span><a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MIT Election Data + Science Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released a new report detailing the findings from the 2024 <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13116" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SPAE2024-228x300.png" alt="" width="228" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SPAE2024-228x300.png 228w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SPAE2024-778x1024.png 778w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SPAE2024-768x1010.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SPAE2024.png 1058w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" />Survey of the Performance of American Elections (SPAE). As the only national survey of election administration that focuses on voting processes and voter experiences, the SPAE provides key insights into Americans’ experiences at the polls and voters’ perspectives on the performance of elections in their respective states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SPAE has been conducted following every presidential election since 2008, as well as after the 2014 and 2022 midterms. In 2024, 10,200 registered voters participated, with 200 responses collected from each state and the District of Columbia. Drawing on a sample of this size enables a more accurate understanding of the voter experience state by state, allows for the examination of the effects of changing election laws, and facilitates comparisons across state lines. With more than a decade of data to draw on, the SPAE also allows us to examine trends over time. (Data from all survey years—including 2024—are freely available on our Dataverse</span><a href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GWBAP5"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, the SPAE’s questions cover voter behavior, attitudes, and voting methods. Similar to the 2022 survey, the 2024 SPAE included questions on threats and fears of violence in and around polling places, as well as questions about voters’ confidence in the security and accuracy of the electoral process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024, the share of voters who cast their ballots by mail continued to drop from the record set in 2020. Both early voters and Election Day voters nationwide reported smooth processes, with few issues. Wait times also decreased from 2020. Overall voter confidence was high, with 96% of respondents indicating that they were very or somewhat confident that their vote was counted as cast—an increase from 91% in 2020. However, partisan differences remained. Awareness about election security measures remained low, but support for most security practices remained high; respondents also continue to believe that voter fraud is rare, although attitudes continue to be polarized along partisan lines.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full report can be found on</span><a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/projects/survey-performance-american-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the MIT Election Lab’s website here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with the 2024 dataset and a summary of key findings. In addition, we will host a webinar to cover the SPAE and our 2024 findings. We cordially invite you to join the Lab’s founding director, Dr. Charles Stewart, on Tuesday, July 29 at 2pm ET for “How We Voted in 2024: A Deep Dive,” a detailed tour through the 2024 data and insights. The webinar is free and open to the public; to attend,</span><a href="https://mit.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_4lKQw99mS4q4lcFcdDPPZw"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> please register via Zoom here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Federal Update</strong>: Several more states including <a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2025/07/23/justice-department-conservative-law-firm-set-sights-on-maryland-voter-registrations/">Maryland</a>, <a href="https://www.votebeat.org/michigan/2025/07/24/doj-justice-department-voter-roll-maintenance-letter/">Michigan</a> and <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/after-initial-request-u-s-doj-has-not-obtained-wisconsin-voter-data/">Wisconsin</a>, have reported receiving correspondence for the U.S. Department of Justice seeking access to voter rolls and election data. And in <a href="https://www.golocalprov.com/news/former-providence-mayor-taveras-hired-by-amore-to-handle-doj-probe-into-ri">Rhode Island</a>, Secretary of State Gregg Amore has hired former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras and his law firm  to serve as legal counsel. Taveras will respond to the probe by the DOJ. According to CyberScoop, in a congressional hearing on state voter registration practices this week, Republicans on the <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/house-republicans-state-voter-roll-purges-hearing-gop-fraud-claims/">House Administration Committee</a> were united around common sentiments: It is too easy for citizens to register to vote and too easy for them to stay on voter rolls, states aren’t doing enough to remove ineligible voters, and it’s all led to the country’s elections being vulnerable to mass voter fraud and noncitizen voting. There was little evidence presented to back up most of those claims. Yet, the hearing focused on how states and the federal government could better review voter registration databases, with lawmakers hearing from two conservative nonprofit representatives  and a North Carolina voter who was wrongly removed from the state’s voter rolls last year. <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5409448-gabbard-alleges-obama-officials-manipulated-intelligence/">Director of National Intelligence </a>Tulsi Gabbard released a report July 18 alleging Obama administration officials manipulated intelligence related to Russian interference in the 2016 election. In March President Trump  signed a memo ordering the declassification of “all files related to Crossfire Hurricane,” the name given to the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The intelligence agencies Gabbard oversees have long concluded that Russia sought to influence the 2016 election — an assessment that was backed by other outside entities. That includes a three-year bipartisan Senate investigation that concluded in a more than 1,300 page report that Russia was aggressive in seeking to interfere with the election on Trump’s behalf, including by launching a massive social media campaign. Gabbard’s memo, as well as another 114 pages of related documents, primarily rests on claims there was no indication of a Russian effort to directly manipulate the actual vote count. However, that is not at odds with the conclusion of the intelligence community or the Senate report, which determined there was “no evidence that any votes were changed or that any voting machines were manipulated.” The Obama administration said it had seen no evidence that hackers tampered with the results. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/us/politics/rubio-foreign-elections-cable.html">State Department </a>will restrict its commentary on the legitimacy of foreign elections to “rare” occasions, according to a new directive from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that continues the Administration’s turn away from promoting democracy abroad. In an official cable to diplomatic and consular posts on July 17, Rubio said that public comments on foreign elections “should be brief, focused on congratulating the winning candidate and, when appropriate, noting shared foreign policy interests.” Such messages, the agency memo added, “should avoid opining on the fairness or integrity of an electoral process, its legitimacy, or the democratic values of the country in question.” The directive applied to the department’s domestic offices and foreign posts, Rubio said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5869" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AZ-Welcome-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Election Security</strong>: According to Votebeat, a </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2025/07/17/hacker-gains-access-election-website-candidate-profiles/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hacker gained access to the web portal Arizona candidates use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to upload information about themselves and changed candidate profile photos that were live on the election results website three weeks before the special congressional primary election. The Secretary of State’s Office realized the system had been breached, shut down the candidate portal the week of June 23, and kept it offline for a week, according to JP Martin, an office spokesperson. Martin told Votebeat officials flagged the problem upon noticing unusual activity. The hacker was able to gain access to candidates’ individual profiles, where the information they upload, including candidate filings, is stored. While much of that is public information, the office is still investigating whether any private, personally identifying information was improperly accessed, Martin said. When the office’s cybersecurity team realized that a malicious actor had gained access, Martin said, it contacted the Arizona Department of Homeland Security, the National Guard, and a private cybersecurity firm to help. All three are helping with the investigation, he said. The candidate portal is separate from the state’s voter registration and petition signature gathering systems. No voter data was accessed, Martin said. According to CyberScoop, while officials say the threat is contained and the vulnerability has been fixed, they also </span><a href="https://cyberscoop.com/arizona-secretary-of-state-website-hack-candidate-portal-criticizes-cisa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blasted the lack of support they’ve received from the federal government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, claiming the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is no longer a reliable partner in election security under the Trump administration. Arizona, through its state DHS, contacted multiple federal agencies about the hack, including the FBI. But CISA was not part of that outreach. In a statement, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes (D), who has long focused on election security, said that this once-fruitful partnership between CISA and states had been damaged as the agency has been “weakened and politicized” under the Trump administration. “Up until 2024, CISA was a strong and reliable partner in our shared mission of securing American digital infrastructure, but since then the agency has been politicized and weakened by the current administration,” Fontes said.  </span></p>

The center-left Labour Party pledged before it was elected in July 2024 to lower the voting age for elections to Britain’s Parliament. Scotland and Wales already let 16- and 17-year-olds vote in local and regional elections. Britain will join the short list of countries where the voting age is 16, alongside the likes of Austria, Brazil and Ecuador. A handful of European Union countries, including Belgium, Germany and Malta, allow 16-year-olds to vote in elections to the European Parliament. Additionally, the government said it will introduce automatic voter registration and allow voters to use bank cards as a form of identification at polling stations. The previous Conservative government introduced a requirement for voters to show photo identification in 2022, a measure it said would combat fraud. Critics argued it could disenfranchise millions of voters, particularly the young, the poor and members of ethnic minorities. Elections watchdog the Electoral Commission estimates that about 750,000 people did not vote in last year’s election because they lacked ID. Turnout in the 2024 election was 59.7%, the lowest level in more than two decades.</span></p>

Chowhound has a piece on the historical dessert that pre-dated the “I Voted” sticker as a “reward” for voting. Election Cake is believed to have emerged from Hartford, Connecticut, although it&#8217;s sometimes described more generally as a New England tradition. The cake is a fruitcake made with yeast, similar to classic English fruitcakes in terms of ingredients, but with a lighter texture. The first recorded mentions of Election Cake date to 1771. In the pre-revolutionary times, the few colonists with the right to vote had to travel to larger cities and towns, where the cakes would be served to them. Election Cake features plenty of dried fruit and nuts, as well as spices like nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and allspice. It&#8217;s a boozy cake, too. According to Chowhound, Election Cake&#8217;s biggest moment was probably in the 18th century, since it was already considered passé by the early 1800s and has unfortunately become an outdated dessert that no one makes anymore. We </span><a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/election-cake-3364599"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found a recipe for you here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and fortunately you don’t have to wade through anything to get to the good. </span></p>

The contest launched in March, with county residents between the ages of five and 18 eligible to design the county’s “I Voted” stickers to be given out in November. Legislators picked the winners in three age groups at their June work session. “So, when it comes to election time, everyone’s going to get one of these stickers,” Legislature Chair Marte Sauerbrey said. County Republican Election Commissioner Kelly Johnson thanked the participants and said they hope to make the contest an annual tradition. “We were very pleased to start this — hopefully it becomes a long-term tradition this year,” Democratic Election Commissioner James Wahls said. “We think it’s just a great way to get our young folks involved in civic engagement — to be involved in the voting process for our county.” Sauerbrey concluded the recognition of the winners by praising the work of the Board of Elections, saying they work hard and are very much appreciated, especially during the hectic election season.</span></p>

Marinello</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has died from brain cancer. She was 72. Marinello served on the board since 2008, and she died on July 18, said her fellow Democrat on the board, Mike Sexton. &#8220;Just an outstanding, dedicated Democrat,&#8221; Sexton said of Marinello. &#8220;Her work was meticulous. She’s very efficient, and she’s been one of the most loyal Democrats I have ever met.&#8221; Sexton said Marinello was diagnosed with cancer just about a month ago at the end of June. Doug Preisse, a Republican and chairman of the Franklin County Board of Elections, told the Dispatch that the whole board is saddened, and Marinello was a truly decent person. &#8220;For the many years I served with Kim, while she was always a loyal Democrat, she was first and foremost a loyal public servant,&#8221; Preisse said. &#8220;She looked out for the best interest of Franklin County voters. It was a pleasure and honor to serve next to her.&#8221;</span></p>

He was 75. A faculty member at Rice for 46 years, Stein retired June 30. He held the Lena Gohlman Fox Professorship of Political Science — a title designated emeritus upon his retirement. He also served as dean of the School of Social Sciences, chair of the political science department and fellow in urban politics at Rice’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. According to Rice, Stein was widely respected as an expert on voting behavior, emergency preparedness and local government. His research — frequently funded by the National Science Foundation, Pew Charitable Trusts and other prominent institutions — informed election policy and public service programs across the country. He was also a go-to resource for many political journalists, both locally and nationally. His sharp, data-driven analysis regularly appeared on Houston newscasts as well as outlets including The New York Times, The Washington Post and NPR, making him one of the most trusted political voices in the region. “Bob Stein was a towering figure whose passion for research, teaching and public service left an indelible mark on Rice and our city,” Rice President Reginald DesRoches said. “His work exemplified how universities can drive meaningful change in the world around them. We will deeply miss his wisdom, generosity and steadfast commitment to empowering our students to become thoughtful, engaged citizens.” Stein is survived by his wife, Marty; their daughters, Nora and Annie; and five grandchildren.</span></p>

The proposed ballot measure aims to implement these requirements for both in-person and mail-in voting, sparking debate over election security and voter accessibility. The proposed ballot measure would mandate state verification of citizenship during voter registration and require voters to present identification at polling places. For mail-in ballots, voters would need to provide the last four digits of their Social Security number or another form of government-issued ID. This campaign follows a previously unsuccessful ballot measure in 2023 and similar legislation that failed to advance earlier this year. To appear on the 2026 ballot, the petition must gather more than 874,000 verified signatures. DeMaio&#8217;s campaign is aiming to collect over one million signatures to ensure its place on the ballot.</span></p>

The legislation, submitted July 9 by State Senator Kelly Dooner, would require mail-in ballots postmarked by the day of the election to be counted in special elections, according to a press release issued by Quintal. Marc Pacheco, director of elections for Taunton’s Elections Department, confirmed the disqualified mail-in ballots.  He said, when it comes to special elections, per state law, all voting ballots submitted by mail must be received by the city or town clerk prior to the closing of polls, which was 8 p.m., on the day of the election held on June 10. Those mail-in ballots were not received by the elections office in time to be counted.  “The law is clear and we followed the law.” Quintal’s legislation amends Massachusetts General Law Chapter 54 section 25 to bring it in line with the counting of ballots in November elections.</span></p>

Petition sheets and signature gatherers began fanning out July 17 and the campaign Rank MI Vote began holding field launch events across the state. That includes the Latin Americans United for Progress Fiesta in Holland and the Ann Arbor Art Fair. Pat Zabawa, Rank MI Vote’s executive director, said the first signature will be his on Thursday morning. “One down, 446,197 to go,” Zabawa said in a statement. “Obviously, we have our work cut out for us: when we qualify for the ballot, it will have taken the biggest signature collection campaign in Michigan history. That might intimidate some campaigns, but it’s what this team is built for. We have thousands of volunteers who are very eager to win this with shoe leather and hard work. We’re now in the stage of the campaign where progress is measured in how much ink we put on paper and how many conversations we have with our friends and neighbors.”</span></p>

Under the new rule, voters who haven’t lived in North Carolina before, state elections director Sam Hayes said, those “never resident” voters would still be allowed to vote in federal races under federal voting law. But their votes in other races will no longer be counted. The other rule approved Monday confirms the process of verifying the address of voters who use same-day registration by mailing them a postcard, and, if it’s returned, giving the voter a second chance to confirm their address. State lawmakers had previously removed the requirement for the second attempt, but it was added back as a temporary rule after voting rights groups sued over the change in federal court. The vote on Monday affirms that the two-step process will be the process going forward.</span></p>

Jill Cooper (R-Westmoreland) wants to encourage Pennsylvanians to vote for candidates based on their qualifications and policies, as opposed to regional ties, which can strongly influence statewide elections. Cooper says she plans to introduce legislation to </span><a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/lawmaker-proposes-removing-candidates-home-counties-from-pa-primary-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eliminate the requirement to list candidates’ home counties on primary ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She argues the change would eliminate divisive attitudes toward candidates based on geographical stereotypes. Pennsylvania’s Election Code currently requires primary ballots to include candidates’ home county or municipality. A candidate’s county must be printed opposite or under the candidate’s name when it appears on ballots in multiple counties. When a candidate is running in only one county, or a district within that county, the candidate’s home city, borough, township or ward, must also be printed opposite or under their name on the ballot. The requirement does not apply to general election ballots.</span></p>

Casper </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-election-executive-order-lawsuit-injunction-e73a4a02aeb9abe77bf10fefd3181510"><span style="font-weight: 400;">modified part of a previous ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that blocked much of President Donald Trump’s executive order seeking to overhaul elections in the U.S. The minor change affects just one aspect of a preliminary injunction that Casper granted on June 13 in a case filed by Democratic state attorneys general. The judge said that the part of Trump’s order directing certain federal agencies to assess people’s U.S. citizenship when they ask for voter registration forms will now only be blocked in the 19 states that filed the lawsuit. According to the Associated Press, election law experts said the modification will have little, if any, practical effect because a judge in a different lawsuit filed against the executive order also blocked the federal agencies from obeying the mandate in all 50 states. The order follows a U.S. Supreme Court decision in an unrelated case that judges are limited in granting nationwide injunctions. Government lawyers pointed to that ruling in arguing the court needed to “narrow the scope” of the injunction in the elections case. The 19 Democratic attorneys general who filed the case told the judge they wouldn’t object to the narrower scope. The rest of Casper’s initial preliminary injunction against other aspects of the election executive order remains intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell got a reprieve this week over a </span><a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/07/23/us-appeals-court-gives-mypillows-lindell-break-over-5m-prize"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5 million award to a man who discredited conspiracies </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">tied to the 2020 election. The 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals reversed a lower court&#8217;s ruling. The appeals judges wrote in a 12-page decision that a panel of arbitrators went too far in requiring Lindell to pay a man who offered proof that cyber data used by 2020 election deniers was invalid. In 2021, Lindell held a South Dakota symposium featuring a “Prove Mike Wrong Challenge” that put up a $5 million reward to anyone who could prove him wrong. Lindell is a staunch ally of President Donald Trump. Software developer Robert Zeidman concluded the data provided wasn&#8217;t valid and spelled out the reasons in a report submitted during the contest. But when he didn’t get the prize, Zeidman claimed breach of contract by the Lindell Management LLC entity set up to run the event. He went to arbitration and after a three-day hearing was awarded the money. Lindell went to court and lost the first round. But Wednesday’s appeals court ruling takes Lindell off the hook, barring additional court review.</span></p>

According to the research of Chief Magistrate Judge Scott Varholak, however, no federal court in the history of the United States has ever intervened to release an inmate on bond pending a state court appeal. In fact, Varholak said he isn’t even sure how doing so would be logistically possible. “What if petitioner violates the bond? Does the state revoke bond? Do I revoke bond? I don’t think petitioner has cited a single case in the history of the United States where a federal court granted an appeal bond in a state case,” Varholak said. Peters is currently serving a nine-year prison sentence after a jury found her guilty of committing four felonies and three misdemeanors related to a 2021 leak of voting machine data. The Colorado Court of Appeals denied Peters’ request for bond pending her appeal, prompting her to file a federal habeas petition in February.</span></p>

Under the agreement, Edmonds would be sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence with three years probation when she goes before Judge Tracy Lee Dayton on Sept. 25. Edmonds was facing four felony charges, including witness tampering and illegal possession of absentee ballots stemming from the 2019 election. The charges against Edmonds stem from a case involving a family she knew that she assisted in filling out absentee ballots in the 2019 mayoral election and then taking and mailing them. Edmonds was working for Democrat Marilyn Moore in that primary election. She also was charged with witness tampering when the family informed her they had been subpoenaed to testify at a civil trial after that election and she tried to convince them not to mention her name.</span></p>

In a filing known as a </span><a href="https://ipmnewsroom.org/feds-weigh-in-on-lawsuit-challenging-how-illinois-maintains-voter-registration-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“statement of interest,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Justice Department said the government has an interest in the outcome of the lawsuit, although the filing stops short of asking the court for permission to intervene as a party in the case. “This case presents important questions regarding enforcement of the National Voter Registration Act,” attorneys in DOJ’s Civil Rights Division said in the filing. “Congress has vested the Attorney General with authority to enforce the NVRA (National Voter Registration Act) on behalf of the United States. Accordingly, the United States has a substantial interest in ensuring proper interpretation of the NVRA.” The lawsuit challenges the state’s practice of delegating to local election officials the responsibility of conducting regular maintenance of voter registration rolls, including the task of purging people from the rolls when they die or move out of the jurisdiction. Under NVRA, the suit argues, the state is responsible for carrying out that function. U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Judge Sara Ellis has indicated she could decide the case at a hearing currently scheduled for July 30.</span></p>

The case focused on the prefilled, mailed ballot applications that voting organizations sent to hundreds of thousands of Kansans leading up to the 2020 presidential election, which was rife with false accusations of illegitimate results nationwide. Republican lawmakers passed</span><a href="https://www.kslegislature.gov/li_2022/b2021_22/measures/hb2332/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2332</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the 2021 session by overriding the governor’s veto. The law sought to ban any non-Kansas resident or business from distributing advance mail ballot applications to voters and prohibit any applications from containing personalized voter information. Supporters argued at the time the law ensured transparent elections free from corruption. In the 2020 general election, around 112,000 Kansas voters mailed a pre-paid or pre-addressed envelope containing an advance ballot application, according to the lawsuit. Vratil evaluated in a 40-page decision whether the law was a content-based regulation and, if the law is content-neutral, whether lawmakers crafted the law for an “improper purpose” or reason, including suppression of free expression. The defendants in the case said that HB 2332 was meant to minimize voter confusion, streamline efficiency in election administration and foster confidence in and protect the integrity of the electoral process. However, they didn’t explain how the law was designed to do those things, Vratil said in the decision. Vratil also considered the timing of the Legislature’s introduction of HB 2332, which came a month after the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol and about three months after the 2020 election. “In Kansas however, one week after the election, on November 10, 2020, Schwab had publicly declared that the 2020 election in Kansas was successful, without widespread, systematic issues of voter fraud, intimidation, irregularities or voting problems — an undisputed fact which calls into question any purported legislative intent to root out fraud, promote efficiency or avoid voter confusion in Kansas elections,” Vratil said.</span></p>

The citizens want the election to be held on August 26, while the two election boards want it moved to November. “The issues in the two cases could not be further apart in a legal analysis and will only complicate and delay this time-sensitive issue, which respondents/election boards clearly are acting to do,” LeVota’s motion said. “Consolidation only complicates the issues and prejudices Relators who filed their own action in an effort to get a timely result.” Along with denying the consolidation, White, the Jackson County Legislature, and the Jackson County Clerk were all dismissed from the case by the citizens. Jackson County elections involve two election boards. The KCEB handles elections in the part of Kansas City that is located in Jackson County. The JCEB handles elections for all other cities in the county. The published Charter has a 60-day deadline. More recently, the legislature, in 2023, approved an ordinance setting guidelines for recall petitions that indicates, “if no legal election date is available within sixty days the election will occur at the next available date after certification of the Petition.” LeVota’s argument against consolidation continued: “It is fundamentally unfair for the election boards to try to hijack Relators’/Citizens’ case with such different facts and law and add the complication and all additional parties and legal action to the writ action,” he said.</span></p>

The GOP alleges that officials within the state elections division violated the records law by failing to return documents within the required seven-business-day response period and by declining to release documents created and maintained by county election officials and shared with the state office. “State officials are slow-walking access to records about voting machines and voter roll maintenance,” Michael Whatley, the committee’s chair, said in a statement. “The RNC is taking legal action because the people of New Jersey have a right to know that their elections are being run fairly, securely, and in full compliance with the law.” A spokesperson for the New Jersey secretary of state, who oversees state elections, declined to comment on the lawsuit. The state has not yet filed a response to the complaint, which was lodged in Superior Court in Mercer County. The Republicans’ request for voter registration documents was voluminous, seeking disclosure of four classes of records of communications with federal agencies spanning two years, every record relating to five national databases over that period, and two years of communications between state and local election officials, among a host of other voter registration-related records. Though New Jersey law largely requires records custodians to fill records requests within seven business days, custodians rarely meet those timelines. Delays to one of the GOP’s requests stretch long even by normal standards.</span></p>

Democracy North Carolina, the North Carolina Black Alliance, and the League of Women Voters of North Carolina all challenge a section of 2023’s Senate Bill 747 called the “undeliverable mail provision.” The provision aimed to change how elections officials dealt with ballots from voters who registered to vote on the same day they cast early-voting ballots. Two other lawsuits targeting the same provision ended in settlements that produced a consent judgment signed by Schroeder. The judge issued an</span><a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/democracy-nc-ump-072125.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week denying requests  to dismiss the remaining lawsuit. “At the most basic level, Plaintiffs seek a return to the same-day registration scheme that predated Senate Bill 747 (‘SB 747’), which required, among other things, that a same-day registrant’s vote not be discarded unless the U.S. Postal Service returned as undeliverable a second mailing addressed to the registrant before the canvass deadline,” Schroeder wrote.</span></p>

Attorneys for the state argued that courts have allowed private plaintiffs to challenge and destabilize state district maps for too long. “Redistricting in a world where well-funded private plaintiffs can induce federal courts to strike down state maps based on theories like those that were asserted in this case becomes nearly impossible,” the state wrote in a July 22 filing. Barring a reversal from the U.S. Supreme Court, the 8th Circuit’s decision would allow North Dakota to revert back to the map approved by state lawmakers in 2021. The tribes intend to petition the high court to review the case in the coming months. It remains to be seen which district map will be in place while their request is being considered.  The plaintiffs have filed a motion asking the Supreme Court to order that the current map — imposed by U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in 2024 — remain for the time being.  The state disputed this interpretation. It said the Legislature’s attorneys were merely throwing out hypotheticals and did not indicate there is a high probability that the lawmakers would be unseated if the 2021 district lines are reinstated. The high court last week issued an administrative stay that temporarily prevents the map from changing while the justices consider whether a longer-term stay is necessary.</span></p>

Announced July 21, the filings by the ACLU of Virginia, Protect Democracy and the law firm WilmerHale seek summary judgment in the case and class-action status on behalf of the more than 300,000 Virginians who they say remain disenfranchised under a state constitutional provision. The plaintiffs argue Virginia is violating a 150-year-old federal law — the Virginia Readmission Act of 1870 — which governed the state’s return to the Union after the Civil War. The suit hinges on a novel interpretation of the 1870 law, which permitted the state’s return to Congress on the condition that its constitution only allow disenfranchisement “as a punishment for such crimes that are now felonies at common law.”  That list, defined in 1870, includes serious offenses like murder, rape and burglary — but not modern offenses such as drug possession. “In Virginia today, we disenfranchise people for things like drug offenses, but those were not felonies at common law in 1870,” said WilmerHale partner Brittany Amadi. “By disenfranchising all people with felony convictions, Virginia is breaking federal law and disproportionately excluding Black and brown people from the ballot box.”</span></p>

That’s after legal counsel representing the defendant, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, filed a motion to toss the case earlier this month. In the explanation for his decision,Skavdahl wrote that the Equality State Policy Center (ESPC), a nonpartisan group that advocates for transparency in government and that in May sued Gray and every county clerk, failed to adequately demonstrate it has the legal standing to ask to block the law. In his decision, Skavdahl said the court “has not considered nor makes any comment on the merits of Plaintiff’s claims.” ESPC’s original complaint said the new law “will impose new, burdensome, and entirely unnecessary requirements that will make it harder for eligible citizens to vote.” Chief among the reasons Skavdahl provided for dismissing the case is that, “Plaintiff is not a voter and cannot register to vote, and thus Plaintiff is not the object or target of HB 156.” The law,</span><a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/HB0156"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB 156</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says voters must have lived in the state for 30 days for residency. It also says a county clerk can reject someone&#8217;s registration due to “any indication” that the person is not a U.S. citizen or Wyoming resident.</span></p>
