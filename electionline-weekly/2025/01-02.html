According to the LATimes article, in California, voters younger than 25 made up 10% of the November electorate, but had nearly 3 in 10 of the ballots set aside for signature issues, according to</span><a href="https://capitolweekly.net/ca120-curing-californias-extra-innings-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by voter data firm Political Data Inc. More than half of the state’s ballots with signature issues were from voters younger than 35. “Most people my age just kind of scribble,” Taylor Johnson, 20, told the Times after his vote was not counted. Johnson told the paper he had only perfected his signature about a month before the election and knew what he signed on the mail ballot probably did not match what the county had on file. “There’s been a big push toward mail voting over the last few years, and I think the tradeoffs aren’t always clear to voters,” Larry Norden, an elections and government expert at the Brennan Center for Justice told The AP. He said it’s important for states and local governments to have procedures that ensure large numbers of eligible mail ballot voters aren’t being disenfranchised. In Nevada in 2024, county election offices rejected about 9,000 mail ballots primarily because of signature problems. “We’ve had signature curing problems since we adopted universal mail-in voting during the pandemic in 2020, and it seems to be getting worse,” said Sondra Cosgrove, history professor at the College of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas and executive director of Vote Nevada, a civic organization. “This is something that’s a crisis level that needs to get fixed.” The potential for signature match problems to affect close races has led some voting rights groups in the state to call for an overhaul of the verification process. “We have to find the best option going forward for people that is more accessible, that gets their votes and ballots counted on time, because it’s crazy when you think about the difference-maker being eight or nine votes,” said Christian Solomon, the state director of Rise Nevada, a youth-led civic engagement group.</span></p>

Andrew M. Cuomo approved a new law to </span><a href="https://www.timesunion.com/capitol/article/new-york-s-automatic-voter-registration-coming-19961796.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically register New York residents as voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they get a new driver’s license or enroll in benefits from the state. That was supposed to start in January 2023. But the launch of automatic voter registration in New York is far behind schedule. The state Board of Elections now says they will be ready to start the effort in the second quarter of 2025 — more than two years after the implementation date for the law. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia use automatic voter registration systems, according to Voting Rights Lab, a nonpartisan organization that tracks election legislation. Those states took an average of about 14 months from legislative or administrative approval to launching their automatic voter registration processes, the Times Union found. Maine’s implementation appears to have taken the longest at just over three years. “It’s no small thing,” said Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, a Queens Democrat who introduced the legislation. “There’s up to 2 million people in the state who are eligible to vote and not registered. That means another (election) cycle went by with many New Yorkers being disenfranchised. Hopefully soon, that will no longer be the case.” The late launch of automatic voter registration comes on the heels of delays in implementing online voter registration, which also kicked off more than two years late. Both registration reforms were delayed by the pandemic. Automatic registration also suffered multiple bidding issues.</span></p>

Alaska voters narrowly approved retaining the voting system during the Nov. 5 election. The margin was 743 votes after a recount was requested by the Alaska Republican Party. The dueling proposed initiatives are similar. </span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25463498/initiative-bill-p-izon-redacted.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was filed by Philip Izon, the Wasilla resident who led the signature-gathering campaign for the recently defeated repeal effort. Izon’s new ballot measure is all but identical to the first one. It would again repeal ranked choice voting and the top-four open primary system Alaska voters narrowly approved four years ago. The </span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25463499/initiative-bill-k-mccarty-redacted.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed by former Eagle River Republican Rep. Ken McCarty, would also eliminate the voting system. But it would go further. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarty’s initiative would repeal a provision intended to combat “dark money” that was also approved by Alaska voters in 2020. Both repeal petitions were submitted to the lieutenant governor’s office Dec. 16 — the first step to getting an initiative on the 2026 ballot. Republican Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom has until Feb. 14 to determine whether the petitions will be certified for signature gathering.</span></p>

Currently, under Maryland’s constitution, when a state legislator vacates their seat, the political party committee from the district selects a replacement. The committee’s recommendation is then sent to the governor, who typically approves the appointment. This process has raised concerns about democratic representation, as replacements can serve substantial portions of a term without ever facing voters. Del. Linda Foley, D-Montgomery County, the bill’s sponsor, said this system can leave constituents without an elected representative for as long as four years. The bill would: Maintain the appointment process to fill vacancies in the General Assembly. Require a special election for lawmakers appointed during the first half of their term, aligning with the presidential primary and general elections to minimize costs.</span></p>

The current date, June 3, overlaps with Shavuot, during which observant Jews cannot write, drive, or use electronics. The bill won unanimous approval in the Senate and the Assembly. Gov. Phil Murphy is expected to sign it. Under the bill, some deadlines related to the primary would shift to correspond with the new June 10 date, though deadlines for nominating petitions, ballot position drawings, and sending vote-by-mail ballots to voters would still correspond to the original primary election date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Assembly approved the overhaul of the </span><a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2024/12/20/nj-legislature-delays-primary-june-10-moves-ballot-redesign/77093622007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">county line ballot design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A select committee met six times to discuss and listen to experts and advocates weigh in on how primary ballots will look in New Jersey moving forward. The committee’s efforts followed a pledge from legislative leaders of both parties in March to consider redesigning New Jersey&#8217;s ballot after a federal lawsuit was brought by now-Sen. Andy Kim during his U.S. Senate run. The bill would require county clerks to design office-block ballots which group candidates by office and would not allow candidates running for different offices to be bracketed together. It would also eliminate the existence of so-called “ballot Siberia,” which isolated some candidates seeking the same office as others to the outer edges of the ballot. The legislation does allow candidates running for the same office to be bracketed and have their names drawn as a group as opposed to individually. It also allows for election officials such as the secretary of state, town clerk or county clerk, to reject slogans that are similar to those used by other candidates and does not allow the use of the name of candidates running for other office in a slogan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Assembly also passed a bill </span><a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2024/12/20/nj-legislature-delays-primary-june-10-moves-ballot-redesign/77093622007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing the number of signatures required for candidates to appear on the ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in primary, general, nonpartisan municipal and school elections. For general elections, the bill would require signatures of 5%, up from 2%, of the entire vote cast for members of the Assembly at the last Assembly election for their direct nominating petition. Candidates for statewide office would need 2,000 as opposed to 800 for their direct nominating petitions, and candidates running for any other office will be required to collect no more than 250 signatures on their direct nominating petitions, up from 100. For primaries, candidates for statewide office would need 2,500 signatures, up from 1,000; candidates for congression will need 500 signatures, up from 200 and candidates for the state Senate and Assembly will need 250 signatures, up from 100. The bill would require candidates for countywide office to collect at least 1% of the total vote cast by the voters of that political party at the last primary election held for the election of that party&#8217;s candidates for Assembly, or at least 300 signatures, whichever is less.</span></p>

The policy requires the board of elections to maintain a minimum of four employees in addition to the commissioners and deputies and has built in requirements to employ two additional employees for every 20,000 active registered voters above 40,000, as determined by the New York State Board of Elections. As of November 1, 2024 there are 140,431 registered voters in Ulster County. Presently, there are 10 employees working at the board of elections, already in compliance with the new requirement.</span></p>

The state will now be blocked from enforcing these particular rules, including one that would have allowed the secretary of state to finalize statewide election results without the results of a county, if the county failed to certify its results by the deadline. That rule had already been suspended by a federal judge in a separate case challenging Fontes’ manual. That challenge was filed in July in federal court by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute. “Nothing in the statutes permits the Secretary to exclude a particular county’s canvass and/or, by extension, disenfranchise the entirety of the county’s voters,” Blaney wrote. Blaney also voided other rules in the manual. These include: A rule that explains the authority of county supervisors when certifying election results; A rule telling county recorders that, if they receive notice from a jury questionnaire that a voter is not a citizen, they may place the voter’s registration in inactive status. Under state law, the recorder must instead cancel their registration; and A footnote that relieves petition circulators of their responsibility in state law to properly list their address and contact information when applying to the secretary of state to act as a circulator. Blaney found in favor of Fontes regarding a line explaining the timing for a new state law that requires county recorders to remove voters from the state’s early voting list if they don’t vote by mail in two election cycles. The first removals must occur in 2027, not 2025, Blaney ruled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Arizona Court of Appeals has </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/arizona-election-certification-interference-cochise-county-a96ba81721ef12309247851854432a9b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected an Arizona official’s argument </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that felony charges against him for delaying certification of his rural county’s 2022 election results should be dismissed because he has legislative immunity. In an order December 31, theCourt concluded Cochise County Supervisor Tom Crosby’s duty to certify the election results wasn’t discretionary. The court also said certifying election results is an administrative responsibility and that legislative immunity doesn’t apply to Crosby’s situation. Crosby and Cochise County Supervisor Peggy Judd, both Republicans, were criminally charged after they balked at certifying the results. Two months ago, Judd pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to perform her duty as an election officer and was sentenced to probation. Crosby has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and interference with an election officer. His trial is scheduled for Jan. 30.</span></p>

Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold disclosed in late October that a document posted to her office’s website included a hidden but accessible worksheet containing Basic Input Output System — or BIOS — passwords to election equipment in counties throughout the state. Days later, McCann’s office formally launched an investigation into “whether the BIOS passwords were knowingly published on the website and if there was any official misconduct on the part of any (Colorado Department of State) employee,” according to a 26-page report released. “After an extensive investigation by prosecutors and investigators in my office, we have concluded that there were no criminal violations of the law regarding the publication of the voting machine passwords,” McCann said in a statement. “Based on everything we have learned, the passwords were published in error and not ‘knowingly,’ as required to prove a violation of C.R.S. 1-13-708(2), or ‘knowingly, arbitrarily or capriciously,’ as required to prove a violation of CRS 18-8-405(1). “There is no indication that the passwords were published in an effort to influence the outcome of an election,” McCann added.</span></p>

On Feb. 7, 2022, before the district attorney’s office filed charges against Peters, she attended a court hearing. During the hearing, the district attorney’s staff told 21st Judicial District Judge Matthew Barrett they saw Peters recording the proceeding on an iPad. At the time, prosecutors claimed, Barrett had issued a decorum order prohibiting recording and relayed the information by posting a sign on the courtroom door. The next day, law enforcement seized the device from Peters. On Feb. 24, 2022, the district attorney’s office filed to cite Peters for contempt. Following Barret&#8217;s recusal, Fifth Judicial District Chief Judge Paul Dunkelman presided over Peter&#8217;s 2023 contempt trial and ultimately ordered her to pay a $1,500 fine. Peters appealed the contempt conviction, arguing the DA&#8217;s office failed to meet its burden of proof by not presenting the court order, or the door sign, announcing the prohibition on recording.</span></p>

Court of Appeals </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/12/27/american-university-anc-race-ruling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined to throw out the contested election results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for two Advisory Neighborhood Commission seats representing American University’s campus, ruling that the city election board’s assertion that some students had probably been given the wrong ballots was not enough to redo the race. Adah Nordan, 20, a candidate for one of the seats, had challenged the November election results because she suspected some voters in her district, 3E07, had mistakenly received ballots for the other American University district, 3E08, as she herself had. The D.C. Board of Elections asked a court this month to void the results for both districts and call new elections. But the D.C. Court of Appeals rejected that motion, concluding that Nordan and the board had not proved that significant mistakes had produced erroneous results. The Board of Elections asked the appeals court to void both elections. But on Friday, three judges on the court ruled that they could void elections only if there was “act or omission, including fraud, misconduct, or mistake serious enough to vitiate the election as a fair expression of the will of the registered qualified electors voting in the election,” and if the petitioners could prove that the wrong election result was the outcome. They said the board had acknowledged that it could not determine whether and to what extent voters had cast ballots in the wrong district.</span></p>

King lost her race last month to incumbent Tom Cook by 97 votes. She argued the county rejected too many ballots because of missing or invalid signatures, and that voters weren’t offered enough help to fix the problems. In Maui County, there were nearly 1,100 deficient ballots compared to the national average. King says Maui County’s rejection rate was nearly double the state average in 2022. But the high court ruled that the County Clerk’s Office followed state law and all administrative rules to cure the deficient ballots.</span></p>

Miller</span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/09/05/idaho-judge-dismisses-ags-challenge-to-open-primaries-ballot-initiative/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Labrador’s legal challenge in September. But Miller, in a Dec. 18 decision, ruled he didn’t find that the attorney general lacked a reasonable legal or factual basis to pursue his challenge, even though Idahoans for Open Primaries were the prevailing party in litigation. Miller ordered the Idaho Attorney General’s Office to pay $96 in costs accrued by Idahoans for Open Primaries. But he didn’t order the office to pay almost $65,000 in attorney fees requested by Idahoans for Open Primaries.</span></p>

He also denied a motion from the Boone County clerk to strike a challenge to the local November election, effectively allowing said challenge to proceed in court. Based on his interpretation of the law, Bruegemann said, the court did not have the authority to toss a certified election result and, therefore, could not grant either motion. “I respect very well what James Madison said in the ‘Federalist Papers,’ and that is a judge’s duty is to rule according to what the law is, not what he thinks it ought to be,” Bruegemann said, “and I shouldn’t stick my finger in the air and try to decide what I think would be the best way to fix this when the statutes don’t give me that authority.” Bruegemann made his decisions at a hearing on December 30. The hearing was called following a request for a restraining order current City Commission Doug Bine and his legal team filed on Dec. 27, which would have effectively prevented the winners of the election  from taking office. </span></p>

A three-judge appellate panel found the state senators and representatives, all Republicans, lacked standing to sue over the election law changes, despite their assertion that the reform process violated the U.S. Constitution. &#8220;In Michigan, as in seventeen other states, citizens may use ballot initiatives to amend the State’s Constitution. Two Michigan state senators and nine state representatives argue that, if citizens use the initiative to regulate federal elections, that process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">violates the elections clause of the U.S. Constitution. Because they lack standing to bring the lawsuit, we affirm the district court’s dismissal,&#8221; Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote in the unanimous 10-page</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/sixth-circuit-michigan-senators-ballot-initiatives-opinion.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The pair of state constitutional amendments at issue, passed in 2018 and 2022, changed Michigan election laws by ensuring a right to a secret ballot, ensuring ballot access for overseas and military voters, adding straight-ticket voting and making it easier for citizens to vote. The 2018 amendment passed with 67% of the vote and the 2022 amendment got 60%.</span></p>

Roy Cooper and Governor Josh Stein sued Republican legislative leaders on December 23, </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/12/23/cooper-stein-sue-gop-leaders-to-block-law-stripping-governors-power-over-nc-elections-board/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking to block part of a new law that strips the governor’s office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the power to appoint members of the state elections board. </span><a href="https://governor.nc.gov/state-board-elections-motion/open"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is their second against Senate Bill 382, a wide-ranging law that shifts executive power away from offices held by Democrats. Cooper and Stein have also sued to block the portion of the law making the NC Highway Patrol an independent department. SB 382 transfers oversight and appointment power for the State Board of Elections to the state auditor’s office — soon to be held by Dave Boliek, a Republican. The board has confirmed that if that portion of the law takes effect (in May), control of the board could change hands to Republican. “We have had the same structure for our state board of elections for nearly a century and it has served North Carolina well, with fair and secure elections across our state through every cycle,” Cooper said in a statement. “These blatantly partisan efforts to give control over elections boards to a newly elected Republican will create distrust in our elections process and serve no legitimate purpose.” “In recent years, these legislative leaders have repeatedly tried and failed to seize control of the State Board of Elections for their own partisan gain,” Stein said. “This latest move insults the voters who rejected their power grab, violates our constitution, and must not stand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal district court judge has denied Republican Jefferson Griffin&#8217;s request for a </span><a href="https://www.wunc.org/politics/2024-12-20/federal-judge-denies-request-temporary-restraining-order-disputed-nc-supreme-court-race"><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporary restraining order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his bid to block the North Carolina State Board of Elections from certifying his electoral loss in a race for a seat on the state Supreme Court. That&#8217;s strike one in federal court for Griffin, a judge on the North Carolina Court of Appeals, who trails Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs by more than 700 votes following two recounts in the tight race for the associate justice seat. Griffin is protesting more than 60,000 ballots in the statewide contest over alleged irregularities, including purported incomplete registrations. The voters swept up in the wide net of Griffin&#8217;s protests included registered Democrats, Republicans, Riggs&#8217; parents, and an editor at WUNC. After the state elections board rejected Griffin&#8217;s protests due to a lack of sufficient evidence and a failure to give affected voters adequate notice, the GOP candidate turned to North Carolina&#8217;s solidly conservative Supreme Court—the one he wants to serve on—for help. Justice Riggs, Griffin&#8217;s opponent in the state Supreme Court race, immediately recused herself. Griffin filed what&#8217;s known as a writ of prohibition, asking the high court to block certification of the election, and to invalidate the challenged ballots.</span></p>

The Commonwealth Court said the Department of State does not have to reimburse counties when they decertify machines, a defeat for Fulton County in a dispute that arose after two Republican county commissioners permitted Wake Technology Services Inc. to examine and obtain data from Dominion voting machines in 2021. That led the state elections agency to issue a directive against such third-party access based on concerns it could compromise security. Fulton’s machines were decertified as a result of the Wake TSI examination and the secretary of state was sued by the county as well as Republican county commissioners Randy Bunch and Stuart Ulsh. Fulton had argued it had broad authority over the voting machines, while the secretary of state said that “would mean that every county board of elections can do whatever it wants” with electronic voting systems under their authority to inspect elections, “an absurd and unreasonable result,” wrote Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer for the majority.  She said a 1937 state election law gave county election boards broad power, but state lawmakers amended it “to give the secretary an important role in ensuring statewide consistency and safety” regarding electronic voting systems. The state and local power balance over elections and voting equipment, the majority said, helps “protect and provide for free and fair and secure elections.” “There is no conflict between those provisions, and it is entirely possible — indeed necessary — for county boards of elections to fulfill their powers and duties while heeding the secretary’s report and directives,” Jubelirer wrote for the majority.</span></p>

Birkner was charged with fraudulent registration or voting on Dec. 18, a SLED news release said. Between Oct. 4 and 29, Birkner allegedly used the name of a person who died in August to cast a ballot in the 2024 general election in Oconee County, SLED said. It’s unclear whether Birkner is accused of casting multiple ballots, including one in her own name. Birkner was booked into the Oconee County Detention Center where she later posted a $5,000bond.</span></p>

While we will likely focus on research from social sciences and computer science, we welcome research from all disciplines and methodologies.  Our main focus will be on the 2024 U.S. elections, but we welcome research proposals from previous elections or elections in other nations. <strong>When:</strong> January 16-17, 2025. <strong>Where:</strong> Pasadena, California. </span></p>
