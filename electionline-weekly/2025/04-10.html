							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Prioritizing voters over county lines</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado counties team up to make voting easier</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more than two decades, Colorado county elections officials have been innovating and working to make voting easier for Coloradans – which then often has a trickle down effect to voters nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest innovation is a collaboration between three counties – </span><a href="https://www.adamscountycoelections.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.arapahoevotes.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arapahoe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Clerk-and-Recorder/Elections-Division"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado’s county lines often intersect zip codes, municipalities, legislative and even school districts. Voters must be serviced by their county of origin in all election matters. This leads to frustration when voters need to update their information or simply prefer to vote in person, only to find themselves at a Voter Service and Polling Center (VSPC) located just across the county line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address this, starting back in 2013 [like we mentioned, they’ve been at this for a while], Adams, Arapahoe, and Denver counties forged a partnership to co-locate 24/7 ballot drop boxes.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_12706" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12706" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-12706" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newser04.10.25A-300x224.png" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newser04.10.25A-300x224.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newser04.10.25A-768x573.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newser04.10.25A.png 920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-12706" class="wp-caption-text"><em>The first co-located VCPS</em>.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first co-branded 24/7 ballot drop box was installed in Glendale, a “donut hole” of Arapahoe County surrounded by Denver. Six additional co-branded ballot drop boxes have been installed since then. Ballots are delivered to the respective counties by a bipartisan pair of citizen judges from the host county, and ballots for distant counties are sent overnight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that Colorado is the </span><a href="https://www.larimer.gov/clerk/elections/resources/history-vote-centers/vote-center-history"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home of the original vote centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the next logical step was for co-located VSPCs, which ensures voters who unknowingly are in the neighboring county can still easily cast their votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People don’t care which county their closest grocery store is in; they just want to get what they need and get back home. Our experience with voters is the same—they just want to vote their full ballot, regardless of which county their closest VSPC is in,” said Arapahoe County Deputy Director of Elections Bill Mast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first VSPC where counties partnered is located at the convergence of all three counties. The Martin Luther King, Jr. library situated within Arapahoe County, is only 250 feet from Adams County and just under a mile from Denver. Further, it is directly on a main transit line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I actually grew up in that area, going to school not far from the VSPC,” said Arapahoe County Clerk and Recorder Joan Lopez. “My mother would have to take the bus in order to cast her ballot in the proper precinct, and it sure would have been nice to have a place closer to home for her to vote.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez said that voters have shared that they appreciate the convenience and ease of access that comes with the shared centers. They appreciate being able to vote their full ballot that contains all their special district and local contests, instead of a statewide ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s not just voters who have appreciated the shared VSPCs. Election workers have enjoyed the experience as well. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_12707" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12707" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-12707" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newser04.10.25B-300x223.png" alt="" width="300" height="223" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newser04.10.25B-300x223.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newser04.10.25B-768x572.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newser04.10.25B.png 962w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-12707" class="wp-caption-text"><em>A look inside a co-located VSPC.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Denver voters have overwhelmingly appreciated having a vote center shared between counties. Many have noted that it gives more accessibility for people living in border communities to vote,” said Mikayla Ortega, spokesperson for Denver Elections. “Additionally, while the endeavor was initially novel, our election workers said they appreciate getting to see how other jurisdictions work through their processes and procedures while working together to make the center a success.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arapahoe County has hosted a VSPC in the MLK branch library since 2019, with Adams joining in 2022, and Denver in 2023. Despite differing jurisdictions, this traditionally underserved area benefits from the location, enhancing election equity outreach across all three counties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we developed plans for this VSPC, the minimal pushback we received centered around whether turnout size would be large enough to justify hosting the shared site. The actual turnout at the facility quickly assuaged those concerns,” Arapahoe’s Mast said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the original site, Adams County now hosts Arapahoe at a location in the east-end of the counties (Bennett) and Denver is hosting Arapahoe near three small “donut holes” within Denver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over about the past decade we’ve grown our cross-county partnerships to seven shared drop boxes and three shared voter service and polling centers, in both rural and urban areas,” Mast said. “There seems to always be something one partner can offer the other, and you can tailor partnerships to meet each other’s needs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denver County’s Ortega said that the experience has give the elections office confidence in working with other jurisdictions and that the success of the shared sites is a testament to the county’s  commitment to equity and access to all eligible voters in our jurisdictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to encourage other offices to be open to working together across jurisdictional boundaries to increase access for voters,” Ortega said. “This collaboration and partnership is valuable for the office and voters, and shows that we are better and stronger when we work together.” </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">(A Professional Practice Paper on the joint vote centers received a People’s Choice Award at the Election Center’s 2024 Annual Conference and was highlighted during the February 2025 Special Workshop. In the coming months, electionline will be featuring more award-winning professional practices.)</span></em></p>

In the memoranda, he revoked the security clearance of </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/09/trump-orders-probe-krebs-2020-election/83016002007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">former CISA Director Christphoher Krebs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ordered a federal investigation into Krebbs as well as Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security during Trump’s first term. White House staff secretary Will Scharf, when handing the order to Trump to sign, said it addressed Krebs&#8217; access to government, existing clearances he might have, and instructed the Justice Department and &#8220;other aspects of your government to investigate some of the malign acts that he participated in while he was still head of CISA.&#8221; During the signing ceremony, although Trump appointed him, the president said he really didn’t know him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I met him. I&#8217;m sure I met him, but I didn&#8217;t know him. And he came out right after the election, which was a rigged election, badly rigged election. We did phenomenally in that election,&#8221; Trump said according to USA Today. Trump went on to say 2020 was &#8220;a very corrupt election,&#8221; an allegation disproven by numerous investigations. In reference to Krebs, Trump added, &#8220;And we&#8217;re going to find out about this guy too, because this guy&#8217;s a wise guy. He said this is the most secure election in the history of our country. No, this was a disaster.&#8221; Krebs </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-orders-probes-two-former-officials-defied-rcna200523"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined to comment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Taylor</span><a href="https://x.com/MilesTaylorUSA/status/1910071199042068916"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he wasn&#8217;t surprised by Trump&#8217;s actions. “I said this would happen,” Taylor wrote. “Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path.”</span></p>

Under state law, teenagers who will turn 18 by Election Day can register to vote up to 13 months in advance. One way of doing so would be for teens to check a box while applying for a driver’s license saying they want to register. But the state DMV’s system was set up to filter out applicants who weren’t already 18 when they clicked the button, regardless of whether or not they would be old enough to vote by the election. The system did not forward the information of more than 17,000 teenagers to the State Election Commission who would have been eligible to vote by Election Day but didn’t tell them that, according to the state ACLU. Nearly 1,900 of those teenagers didn’t register any other way, meaning they were out of luck when it came time to vote in November, attorneys for the DMV said previously. The issue</span><a href="https://scdailygazette.com/2024/10/22/sc-civil-liberties-group-sues-state-dmv-election-commission-over-teen-voter-registration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prompted a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the ACLU, which unsuccessfully asked a Richland County judge in October to add those voters to the rolls. The group dropped the case in December. But in a March 26 letter, an ACLU attorney threatened to file another lawsuit in federal court arguing the DMV had violated a 1993 federal law requiring the agency help people register to vote. By that point, the DMV had already fixed the problem, attorney Erin Baldwin said in a March 27 letter to an ACLU attorney. “Please know that our agency moved as quickly as possible with a very old computer system to achieve the reprogramming necessary to accomplish this goal,” Baldwin wrote in the letter provided to the Gazette. The DMV will collect information from anyone 16 and older who selects that they would like to register to vote, which it will then send to the state Election Commission. The Election Commission can then register voters who will turn 18 by the election and save the information of those not yet eligible to be registered, Baldwin wrote. “The SCDMV will continue to work proactively with the State Election Commission to ensure we meet all requirements established in law for voter registration,” DMV spokesman Mike Fitts said in an email.</span></p>

He was 71. “Armstead Jones, Sr. was an institution himself. He had just completed 30 years of service to the Board of Elections, nearly 18 of them as chair, overseeing countless fair and free elections. In recent years, as poll workers across our country were under attack, Mr. Jones stood cool, calm and collected on behalf of all Baltimoreans and our right to vote,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said. “The Board of Elections today is a credit to his work to recruit and train the very best—and his legacy will forever live on in Baltimore politics.” Jones entered his career in elections in 1995 as a board member. He became president of the Baltimore City Board of Elections in 2003, then its director. Jones oversaw city elections through countless changes, including a shift in the city election calendar and more recently the move to widespread voting by mail amid the pandemic, a shift that challenged election directors across the state. Jones was on leave when he announced his retirement on Friday and was expected to officially retire from the position effective May 1. In recent years, Jones stepped away from the role several times because of health challenges, including being on leave for the 2024 primary preparations and being hospitalized during the 2022 gubernatorial election. &#8220;His contributions to the growth, knowledge and development of this staff and new board members will sustain many of us as we move forward in this progress,&#8221; Scherod Barnes, President of the Baltimore City Board of Elections, said.</span></p>

The research, based on a nationally representative poll of young people conducted immediately after the 2024 election, identifies major trends about young people’s views of our system of government. The organizations found that, by and large, the majority of young people support the basic principles and practices of democracy, but they are often deeply disenchanted with the democracy they experience today. Using advanced statistical analyses they reveal three distinct ways young people are approaching democracy: passive appreciation, dismissive disenchantment, and hostile dissatisfaction. The report breaks down what’s unique about each group and provides insights that can inform efforts to engage them.</span></p>

Voter ID laws have been a central issue in election and voting policy for over two decades and continue to be a focus for policymakers today. These laws require that voters present specific forms of identification when casting their ballot in person. Voter ID requirements differ significantly across states, ranging from strict photo ID mandates to more flexible alternatives which allow voters to prove their identities in a variety of ways and provide fail-safes for those who may not possess the necessary documents. In the majority of states, voters show some form of identification when casting their ballot in person. States that do not request or require a form of ID typically ask for the voter’s signature or other identifying information to confirm the voter’s eligibility. As of April 2, a total of 16 states require some form of identification to vote, with 12 of those states specifically requiring a photo ID. Voter ID laws can be distinguished through four main categories: strict versus non-strict, and photo versus non-photo. Prior to 2005, no state had enacted a strict photo ID law, but now, nearly 25% of eligible voters live in states with strict photo ID laws. MAP&#8217;s latest brief details this relatively recent history of voter ID laws in the U.S. and how the motivation for these policies can be placed in the larger context of voter suppression in America that goes back much further. This brief also outlines the impacts and harms of voter ID laws on specific communities, including:</span></p>

Members of a Senate committee advanced</span><a href="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/09/cd/aea2581642da9a0d098beaf576d4/hb1713.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 1713</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which requires all titles of </span><a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/local-regional-news/2025-04-03/bill-limiting-complexity-of-ballot-titles-advances-in-arkansas-legislature"><span style="font-weight: 400;">citizen-led ballot initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and constitutional amendments to be written at or below an eighth-grade reading level. The bill’s Senate co-sponsor, Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Little Rock, said it’s an effort to make the process more accessible to voters. The bill would only apply to citizen-led measures, not proposals referred to the ballot by lawmakers. Kristin Stuart spoke against the bill in Thursday’s meeting of the Senate State Agencies and Governmental Affairs committee, saying some of the simplest ballot titles wouldn’t pass the test set out by the bill. HB1713 would compel the attorney general to reject ballot titles that are written beyond an eighth-grade level as determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Formula, which was developed for the U.S. Navy in the mid-1970s. The test is a mathematical formula which takes into consideration the total words, sentences and syllables in a text to determine at which grade level it’s written. The bill passed committee on a voice vote and now heads to the full Senate for consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state House committee narrowly voted down a measure that would have</span><a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2025/04/08/house-committee-kills-bill-aimed-at-protecting-early-voting-in-cities"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> guaranteed early voting locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in all Arkansas cities of at least 15,000 people. Presenting</span><a href="https://arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=HB1878&amp;ddBienniumSession=2025%2F2025R"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 1878</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the House State Agencies Committee a little after 10 p.m. on April 7, Rep. Jessie McGruder (D-Marion) said the bill “just ensures that cities that have a population above 15,000 have an early voting location within that city.” He added that, currently, all Arkansas cities of 10,000 or more residents have at least one early voting location, so this bill does not require county election commissioners to do anything they are not already doing. HB1878 is a response to efforts to prevent early voting in West Memphis last year, McGruder said. Republicans on the Crittenden County Board of Election Commissioners could not unanimously agree on an early voting location in West Memphis, so board chairman Frank Barton III declared there would be no early voting in the city. Voters sued the county and the commissioners, arguing that an early voting location was required under state law because West Memphis had early voting in 2022. The Arkansas Supreme Court ultimately ruled that an early voting location was required in the city under state law. In response, as part of their general attack on access to voting this session, Republican legislators introduced legislation that would allow a future board of election commissioners to cancel early voting in West Memphis or anywhere else they might choose.</span></p>

Democrats countered with arguments that DeMaio relied on a partisan report when making his points and that the state’s elections already are secure. “This is something Democrats and Republicans should see as a democracy issue, not a partisan issue,” DeMaio said. DeMaio presented his bill before the Assembly Elections Committee, which voted it down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also voted down another Republican bill —</span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB1214"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Assembly Bill 1214</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Assemblymember Joe Patterson, of Rocklin. However, it did grant Patterson’s request for reconsideration, meaning it could return for another vote at some point. The bill would have reduced the number of days elections officials have to certify the vote, to 21 from 30. Also, officials would have to count at least 25% of the vote seven days after an election, and 67% of it by 14 days after.</span></p>

If successful, voters would also need to verify they’re a U.S. citizen when they register. State law requires voters to provide an ID or driver’s license number and the last four digits of their social security. Essayli and other Republicans don’t think the current system is strong enough to prevent voter fraud. Democrats like Assemblymember Marc Berman, who sits on the elections committee, defended California’s election process. “I’m proud of the system that we have in California. I’m proud that it’s very accessible, that we make it as easy as possible for people to participate in their democracy, but also how secure it is, and how strong our systems are to make sure that we don’t have election fraud in California,” Berman noted. The statewide effort to get voter ID on next year’s ballot is still in its preliminary phase. Proponents are looking to recruit 10,000 volunteers across California to gather 1 million signatures. </span></p>

The county Board of Supervisors unanimously voted to send a letter to Congress opposing two federal bills, including the SAVE Act, which proposes eliminating online and mail-in registration options. The county worries this could disproportionately impact rural residents, people with disabilities, and others with limited access to transportation. &#8220;It&#8217;s just another effort to disenfranchise people, to take the voice away from people here in our community,&#8221; Santa Cruz Distrct 5 supervisor Monica Martinez said. The county says if the SAVE Act were to pass, many out-of-county and out-of-state UCSC students would face challenges if they do not have the necessary documents when registering to vote.</span></p>

Currently Delaware’s presidential primary is held in April – but the primary for statewide and local political offices is held in September – which can cause some confusion for voters.</span><a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?LegislationId=141901"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 65</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Rep. Stephanie T. Bolden and Sen. Nicole Poore, would move the State’s primary elections to April. State lawmakers say having the presidential and state primary elections on the same day would increase voter turnout – and save the state money. The September state primary leaves little time for overseas and military ballots to be received, considered and returned to Delaware in time for the November general election. The measure passed 39 to 1 with 1 absent. The sole vote against the measure came from 14</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District Representative Claire Snyder-Hall of Rehoboth Beach. The bill is now awaiting consideration in the Senate Elections &amp; Government Affairs committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 112, sponsored by Representative Bryan Shupe (R), is proposed legislation that would require voters to present a </span><a href="https://www.wboc.com/news/bill-proposed-in-delaware-looks-to-require-voter-id/article_860ebf19-3522-429a-ba7a-2f6a9256ff6b.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state-issued, photo ID to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The bill was introduced on Tuesday, April 8th. Shupe said the proposed bill includes provisions to account for potential cost barriers. According to Shupe, the bill would make the first state ID received free of charge, and subsequent ones after 20 dollars each. Currently, there is a 40-dollar charge to receive a state ID in Delaware. Shupe said the proposed bill will next be discussed in the Delaware Houses&#8217; Elections and Government Affairs Committee. The representative said he expects their next meeting to be sometime this May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5199" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GACapitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Georgia:</strong> The House </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-elections-bill-dies-keeping-voter-registration-group-and-ballot-drop-off/TGNLQHVFHRBPJHYDHGQDPMCVOE/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">let an elections overhaul bill die</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week failing to take a vote on proposals that would have withdrawn the state from a voter registration accuracy organization and banned absentee ballot drop-off the weekend before Election Day. The bill’s defeat marks the first year since Donald Trump’s narrow loss in 2020 that Georgia Republicans haven’t changed state election laws. House leaders never called the bill up for a vote before the General Assembly ended this year’s legislative session. Instead, the House created a study committee to review Georgia’s touchscreen voting equipment, a possible switch to hand-marked paper ballots and voter registration accuracy. “We are going to look at the elections process as a whole here in Georgia, to craft a more thoughtful, meaningful piece of elections legislation to bring back to the 2026 session,” said state Rep. Tim Fleming, a Republican from Covington and the sponsor of the bill. “I’m disappointed we didn’t get</span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/397"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 397</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the finish line.” Under the bill, Georgia would have become the 10th Republican-led state to quit a 24-state organization that aims to identify outdated voter registrations, the Electronic Registration Information Center. Although the group flagged ineligible voters who have moved away, it has become a target of conservatives who said it wasn’t effective enough. The legislation, which also would have prohibited dropping off ballots, came after Republicans objected to Fulton County’s decision to open election offices the weekend before last year’s election, collecting 307 ballots in-person after it was too late to put them in the mail. The bill also would have empowered the State Election Board, whose Republican majority attempted to pass a series of election rule changes last year before a judge ruled the board exceeded its authority.</span></p>

Mike Braun’s desk. “In the amount of time that we spent debating it, I could have read it word-for-word about 20 times. I’m just flabbergasted,” said Sen. Mike Gaskill of the bipartisan pushback to</span><a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2025/bills/house/1633/details"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 1633</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Gaskill, R-Pendleton, was the legislation’s sponsor. It would direct Morales to estimate any cost savings reaped if Indiana were to require that all counties move from traditional precinct-based voting to a vote center model, which allows voters to cast ballots at any location within their county of residence on Election Day. He’d do the same for municipal election changes, comparing the current schedule — odd-numbered years before presidential elections — to even-numbered presidential and midterm years. Morales would also have to study potential impacts on voter turnout, conduct at least one public meeting in each of the three specified regions and report the results to lawmakers by November. House Bill 1633 goes into effect upon passage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chamber additionally concurred with House edits to Senate bills. Sen. Blake Doriot, R-Goshen, reported two sets of changes to his</span><a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2025/bills/senate/10/details"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 10</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Democrats maintained strong opposition to the measure, which goes to the governor on a 39-9 vote.</span></p>

Kim Reynolds’ desk that included provisions on verifying Iowa voters’ citizenship status. </span><a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF%20954&amp;ga=91"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House File 954</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, passed 32-15, was a bill proposed by Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate that would allow the Secretary of State’s office to contract with federal and state agencies, and with private entities, for voter roll verification and maintenance. The bill also laid out steps for setting a voter’s registration status as “unconfirmed” in cases where the state registrar or a county commissioner “has received information from a reliable source indicating that the registered voter is not qualified.” A “unconfirmed” voter’s status would be changed to “active” after they provide proof that they are qualified to vote under the legislation. The bill also allows for a voter to be challenged at the polls over their citizenship status. A challenged voter is allowed to present precinct election officials evidence or facts to prove they are qualified to vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn after this procedure, the voter would cast a provisional ballot. The bill also included a ban on ranked choice voting. Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, introduced an amendment, which failed, to allow local governments to conduct elections using ranked choice voting. The voting method, also known as instant runoff voting, has voters order candidates on a ballot from their first to last choice, with a candidate winning if they receive the majority of first-choice voters. If there is not a clear winner, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and voters who chose that candidate as their first choice have their votes redistributed to their second choice — a process which repeats until one candidate wins the majority of votes.</span></p>

Tate Reeves that would have expanded pre-Election Day voting options. The governor has been vocally opposed to early voting in Mississippi, and would likely have vetoed the measure. The House and Senate this week overwhelmingly voted for legislation that established a watered-down version of early voting. The proposal would have required voters to go to a circuit clerk’s office and verify their identity with a photo ID. The proposal also listed broad excuses that would have allowed many voters an opportunity to cast early ballots.  The measure passed the House unanimously and the Senate approved it 42-7. However, Sen. Jeff Tate, a Republican from Meridian who strongly opposes early voting, held the bill on a procedural motion.  Senate Elections Chairman Jeremy England chose not to dispose of Tate’s motion on Thursday morning, the last day the Senate was in session. This killed the bill and prevented it from going to the governor.</span></p>

Bill sponsor Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, said in a previous House Government and Veterans Affairs Committee hearing that he revived the bill because voters want &#8220;better&#8221; elected officials with more conservative values, especially when it comes to state funding. During debate, Sen. Ryan Braunberger, D-Fargo, attempted to alter the bill through a floor amendment that would have grandfathered in Fargo’s approval voting process. The amendment failed. &#8220;I agree that we need to make sure that we have elections that are fair and balanced,&#8221; Braunberger said. &#8220;But I also believe that we should listen to our citizens and our localities.&#8221; As of April 8, both chambers have approved the legislation with zero alterations — the Senate with a 38-8 vote and the House with a 75-16 vote. Gov. Kelly Armstrong will now decide whether to put the rule into law.</span></p>

But officials who’d have to implement the bill, which was introduced by a Republican senator, say it would be costly and logistically difficult. </span><a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2025R1/Measures/Overview/SB1054"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1054</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require each of Oregon’s 36 county clerks to livestream footage of the rooms in which ballots are counted and from ballot drop sites during election seasons. It would also require those officials to store those recordings for two years. The bill provides no specific requirements for the placement of livestream cameras, besides stating that any video camera could not be placed in a position to reveal personal details on ballots. A few county elections offices currently livestream their vote counting process. During the 2024 election, for example, the Tillamook County Clerk’s office livestreamed footage from several rooms in which ballots were being collected, verified and sorted through vote-tabulation machines. The bill’s sponsor said requiring similar, more expansive recordings from all county clerks would “give people a window into the room to see this process in an open and transparent way.” But election officials say the one-page bill fails to address several key details of implementing such a measure. One primary concern, they say, is that the bill does not allocate any more funding to county clerks, many of whom have previously reported inadequate funding and staffing levels.</span></p>

The bill comes a year after Gillespie County Republicans hand-counted thousands of primary ballots. If passed, the bill would allow for a faster recount or audit of any hand-counted results. Hand-counts can take days and involve hundreds of people. The bill does not prevent a hand-count or require an audit, she said, but simply makes a faster recount of hand-counted ballots an option.</span></p>

It’s a direct response to what Bexar County and a few other counties did leading up to the November election. “Certain counties in Texas used taxpayer funds to contract with third party companies to send out unsolicited voter registration cards. This practice raised concerns about proper use of funds and integrity of the voter registration process,&#8221; said State Rep. Tom Oliverson of Harris County who authored the House bill.

In a special session Thursday, the Vineyard City Council </span><a href="https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/2025/apr/04/vineyard-city-council-says-goodbye-to-ranked-choice-voting-passes-bond-for-new-city-center-with-stipulations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted not to renew ranked-choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its elections, prior to the pilot program’s end on Jan. 1, 2026. The decision came following a discussion over the effectiveness of the voting method. During the meeting, City Councilwoman Mardi Sifuentes said she recognized the benefit of ranked-choice voting but explained she wanted to move away from the system, citing concerns with the instant runoff and how the redistribution system may not weigh each person’s votes evenly. Mayor Julie Fullmer expressed her support for the program, though she ultimately aligned with the council in a unanimous vote not to renew it. “I think it’s interesting when we’re talking about incumbents and challengers, because ranked-choice voting is an opportunity for (voters) to have to move outside of the name recognition.” she said. “You get to rank your people instead of just voting for one person or two people, whatever the seats are that are open.”</span></p>

But, after two high-profile cases in which candidates were unable to remove their names from the ballot, lawmakers are weighing a change to one of the nation’s strictest withdrawal laws. This week, the Assembly Committee on Campaigns and Elections held a public hearing on the proposal written by Rep. David Steffen, a Republican, to allow candidates for certain statewide, congressional, and legislative offices and independent candidates for president and vice president to withdraw from the ballot any time before the Wisconsin Elections Commission certifies candidates’ names. Calling the current law outdated, Steffen told lawmakers that candidates deserve a straightforward way to remove themselves from consideration before Election Day.</span></p>

They also say that Trump cannot force states to require proof of voter citizenship, and threatening to withhold funding for not complying with provisions in the order violates the U.S. Constitution’s principles of federalism and separation of powers, and adds requirements on the money that weren’t imposed by Congress. The order also requires states to exclude any mail-in or absentee ballots received after Election Day, and it puts states’ federal funding at risk if election officials don’t comply. Some states count ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day or allow voters to correct minor errors on their ballots. Forcing states to change, the suit says, would violate the broad authority the Constitution gives states to set their own election rules. It says they decide the “times, places and manner” of how elections are run. Congress has the power to “make or alter” election regulations, at least for federal office, but the Constitution doesn’t mention any presidential authority over election administration. “We are a democracy — not a monarchy — and this executive order is an authoritarian power grab,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James.</span></p>

Dourbetas rejected both the bid by California Attorney General Rob Bonta and by Huntington Beach resident Mark Bixby to invalidate the city&#8217;s charter amendment that imposed the voter ID requirement because, they argued, it would conflict with state law and burden citizens&#8217; right to vote. &#8220;There is no showing that a voter identification requirement compromises the integrity of a municipal election,&#8221; Dourbetas said. &#8220;Municipal election results do not lack integrity because only residents of a municipality who are eligible to vote participated in the election.&#8221; It was the second time the judge rebuffed the efforts to block the politically controversial voter ID requirement. Last year, he dismissed the two lawsuits because the city hadn&#8217;t yet implemented any ordinances for its voter ID requirement. In February, the California Courts of Appeal </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/people-vs-huntington-beach.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reversed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> him, saying that his decision that the controversy wasn&#8217;t ripe was &#8220;problematic&#8221; and sent the case back to him to rule on California&#8217;s facial challenge, as opposed to an as-applied challenge, that the Huntington Beach voter ID requirement is preempted by state law. &#8220;Now that we have a final order from the Orange County Superior Court, we look forward to moving on and appealing the decision,&#8221; the attorney general said in a statement. &#8220;We remain confident that Measure A will ultimately be struck down.” </span></p>

Her office said that Nessel and her department don&#8217;t have any ethnic, religious or political prejudices, but are asking for an outside prosecutor to avoid any appearance of bias into the probe of a conspiracy by elected officials to illegally cast ballots they collected from voters and paid money for. Nessel&#8217;s office revealed new details about its probe into ballot fraud in 2023 elections in Hamtramck, saying it had asked the FBI to take up the case, but it was rebuffed in December by the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office of the Eastern District of Michigan, which declined to handle the investigation and prosecution. The investigation targets six people, four of them city councilmen and a former city councilman, according to the petition that Nessel&#8217;s office forwarded Friday to the Free Press. Wayne County records reviewed previously by the Free Press showed only two city councilmen were under investigation. It was unclear why the investigation was at a standstill. Hamtramck City Clerk Rana Faraj sent Nessel a letter on March 12 urging her to take action, accusing City Councilman Mohammed Hassan of ballot fraud and acting as if he was untouchable. Faraj expressed concern that more ballot fraud could occur this year, with other council seats up for grabs, along with the mayor&#8217;s seat.</span></p>

Chattah appealed the decision one month later. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office, which was the defendant in the case, commended the dismissal. “No one should be harassed or intimidated for supporting our democratic process, and this bipartisan law shows the importance of putting people over politics,” the office said in a statement. The lawsuit was filed in 2023 by Republican megadonor Robert Beadles, who has funded legal challenges against Nevada election law and threatened officials in Washoe County, and three other plaintiffs. The Ninth Circuit upheld the district court’s dismissal over a lack of standing. Standing requires the plaintiffs to have an injury — in this case, that they ostensibly will not be able to conduct their election observation activities. But the judges wrote that the plaintiffs did not credibly demonstrate an injury, and that the fear of prosecution they cited — a 2020 tweet from Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford saying he would prosecute voter intimidation — was irrelevant because the law had not yet been enacted. “Plaintiffs’ vague allegations amount to ‘some day intentions’ to do something to an elections official that might be misinterpreted as intimidating,” the Ninth Circuit panel wrote. “This is not a specific, concrete plan to engage in conduct arguably proscribed by SB 406.”</span></p>

Gauthier arrived at the polling place after the polls closed at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, according to John Formella, the New Hampshire attorney general.  When election workers told Gauthier he had arrived too late to vote, he became disorderly and began shouting and making obscene statements, Formella said. He said Gauthier&#8217;s disorderly behavior continued after election workers asked him to leave. Gauthier was charged with recklessly creating the risk of a breach of the peace, public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm at the polling place. As part of a negotiated deal, Gauthier pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay a $500 fine with a $120 penalty assessment. He was also ordered to complete 50 hours of community service, to write apology letters to the Ward 3 moderator and an election volunteer and to have no further contact with either of them for two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5224" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/North-Carolina-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />North Carolina</strong>: Two Republican state Appeals Court judges on a three-judge panel agreed with their colleague that thousands of votes in his</span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2025/04/04/appeals-court-rules-in-favor-of-gop-supreme-court-candidate-griffins-election-challenge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> race for a seat on the state Supreme Court </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">were improperly included in vote totals.  The 2-1 ruling gives GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin a boost in his effort to unseat incumbent Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs. Riggs’ 734-vote lead was reaffirmed by two recounts. In his effort to win, Griffin wants more than 60,000 votes thrown out. He sued the state Board of Elections, claiming that counting those votes is against the law.  Republican Appeals Court Judges John Tyson and Fred Gore agreed with Griffin. They wrote that they could order those votes thrown out, but would give most voters the chance to fix deficiencies.  They ordered the state Board of Elections to notify voters of problems. Voters will have 15 business days once the Board sends the notices to “cure” deficiencies, either by providing a partial Social Security number or driver’s license number if those numbers are missing on their voter registration forms, or by providing the copy of a photo or a photo ID exemption form if they were military or overseas absentee voters.  In a 66-page dissent, Judge Tobias Hampson (D) wrote that voters followed the rules they were given and had every expectation that their votes would count.  “Changing the rules by which these lawful voters took part in our electoral process after the election to discard their otherwise valid votes in an attempt to alter the outcome of only one race among many on the ballot is directly counter to law, equity, and the Constitution,” Hampson wrote. Riggs filed an appeal and the </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/nc-supreme-court-suspends-15-day-deadline-for-voters-judge-griffin-is-challenging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state Supreme Court temporarily blocked the order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In his motion, Riggs’ lawyer emphasized the confusion the 15-day deadline would cause.  “It is impossible to predict the full scope of confusion that could result from this 15-day cure process if implemented before this Court’s review,” the petition says.  “Further, the Court of Appeals’ “cure” remedy will be inadequate to prevent the disenfranchisement of thousands of North Carolina voters. There can be no doubt that tens of thousands of voters—through no fault of their own—will be unable to cure their registrations or ballots in time.” Griffin’s lawsuit is headed to the Supreme Court, where Republicans hold a 5-2 majority. Riggs has recused herself.</span></p>

The</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25879913-elections-eo-complaint-filed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was filed by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown in federal district court in Washington. The two northwestern states pioneered laws opposed by Trump that expanded ballot access, including Oregon’s switch to all-mail voting in 2000 and Washington’s switch in 2011. Washington began allowing the counting of ballots that were postmarked by Election Day long before Oregon started doing so in 2022, and advocates for ballot access have long pointed to the northwestern states as a laboratory for modern elections.  “Washington and Oregon are incredibly unique when it comes to our electoral system,” Rayfield said. “We pride ourselves on our elections — vote by mail, our voters pamphlet statements, so many different unique things that go on in the Pacific Northwest, where we were first in this space.”  He and Brown also wanted the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which historically has favored the kinds of progressive laws passed in states like Oregon and Washington, to have a distinct precedent on election laws, Rayfield said. Oregon Secretary of State Tobias Read added in a statement that it’s the state’s responsibility to defend citizens’ right to hold their politicians accountable at the ballot box. “The Trump administration does not have the power to take away Oregonians’ rights to vote and the funding we need to run secure elections,” Read said. “This executive order is nonsense. It’s illegal. And it will not stand.”</span></p>

P. Baxter, who was nominated by President Donald Trump in 2017, wrote in an opinion this week that the date requirement “does not pass constitutional muster.”  The original 2022 lawsuit was filed by Erie County voters Bette Eakin and Ines Massella. Other plaintiffs included John Fetterman’s U.S. Senate campaign, the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The lawsuit asked the court to declare the date requirement unconstitutional and to enjoin county election boards from rejecting mail ballots that were improperly dated or lacked a handwritten date. On April 2, several GOP organizations signaled their intent to push back on the court’s decision. The Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania filed a notice of appeal indicating they would appeal the court’s decision to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</span></p>

Blackburn was placed on a six-month pretrial intervention program Tuesday, according to the Harris County District Attorney&#8217;s office. He will be required to pay $20,000 in restitution, complete eight hours of community service and report to the probation department. If he completes these requirements, the DA&#8217;s office said the charges will be dismissed on Oct. 7. The DA&#8217;s office said Blackburn did not admit any guilt as part of the intervention program. Blackburn&#8217;s attorney did not comment on the matter when contacted Tuesday. Blackburn was charged with six felonies last year — one count of theft and five counts of tampering with government documents. The charges came following an investigation by then-District Attorney Kim Ogg and the Texas Rangers into alleged wrongdoing during the 2022 general election held in Harris County. According to court documents, Blackburn was in charge of allocating equipment and supplies, including paper ballots, to polling locations throughout the county. While the investigation found no evidence that Blackburn or anyone else intended to suppress voter turnout or affect the outcome of the election, investigators said he had been working a second full-time job while being employed at the elections administration office.</span></p>

Washington state law mandates that people attest to their citizenship to register to vote. Statute also requires state and local election officials to regularly review voter rolls to identify people not eligible to vote. In a press conference, Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs called the idea for the review “foolhardy and ridiculous.” The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, argues Trump’s order violates the U.S. Constitution, which says states will decide election mechanics, and unconstitutionally infringes on the right to vote. “The president has no authority to set rules for how states conduct their elections,” said Brown. “Democrats and Republicans in our state have worked together to protect and expand participation in our democracy, and Washington has a robust, safe and secure, voting system.”</span></p>

According to the indictment handed down by the Cabell County grand jury, King and Maynard are accused of knowingly submitting false information on their Certificates of Announcement when declaring their candidacy. The indictment alleges that on or about February 3, 2022, King and Maynard, in an attempt to seek election to the Cabell County Commission, completed sworn declarations falsely stating they were residents of magisterial districts in which they did not actually live.</span></p>

Maya Wiley, President and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and Virginia Kase Solomón, President and CEO of Common Cause, will join Levitsky in a discussion about what the strategies of pro-democracy movements are in this moment, whether they will be enough, and what else can be done.
