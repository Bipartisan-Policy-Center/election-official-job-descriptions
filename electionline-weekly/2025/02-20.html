														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Legislation Update</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">States consider options to ensure that noncitizens aren’t voting</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Wendy Underhill</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Conference of State Legislatures</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a difference a century can make in deciding who can vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before 1925, states went back and forth between permitting noncitizens to vote and requiring citizenship as a qualification. Most states at some point allowed noncitizens to vote, a little-known fact examined by the political scientist Ron Hayduk in the</span><a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/joimai/v16y2015i1d10.1007_s12134-014-0336-6.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Journal of International Migration and Integration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8148" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/USPassport.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Fast forward 100 years: Nowhere in the nation is it permissible for noncitizens to vote in federal elections after the passage of the</span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-104publ208/pdf/PLAW-104publ208.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1996.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, legislation to clarify that noncitizens can’t vote in state elections has been ticking up since 2021, with a growing number of states considering ways to ensure noncitizens aren’t casting ballots. In 2025, over 100 bills have already been introduced addressing voting and citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is noncitizen voting a problem? Some states have been trying to find out. In 2024,</span><a href="https://sos.ga.gov/news/secretary-raffensperger-refers-1600-noncitizen-registrants-local-das-gbi-state-election-board"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted a citizenship audit of its voter rolls and found 20 noncitizens, nine of whom had voted at some point.</span><a href="https://www.ohiosos.gov/media-center/press-releases/2024/2024-08-21/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted a citizenship verification audit and forwarded to the attorney general the records of 138 voters lacking evidence of citizenship. In 2022,</span><a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/fad/harris-county-preliminary-findings-report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted a procedural audit of Harris County’s elections, which included a review of list maintenance activities. Using data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, the audit found that there were potentially 269 noncitizens on the voter rolls statewide, with 47 of them in the county. The audit also confirmed that Harris County cancelled the noncitizen matches before the election and that no one on the list cast a ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the public, a 2024</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/10/24/confidence-in-voting-access-and-integrity-expectations-for-whether-and-when-the-election-results-will-be-clear/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Pew Research Center study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on voter confidence showed “nearly identical majorities of all voters say it is very or somewhat important to stop noncitizens from voting (90%) and to prevent people who are not qualified to vote from doing so (89%).” Pointing to the Pew data, former Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams (R) says no method of preventing noncitizen voting is perfect. “It’s clear that states should use the resources available,” he says, referring to creating processes for verifying citizenship status and, if necessary, removing names from voter lists. As both a former county clerk and secretary of state, Williams provided notice and an opportunity to be heard to individuals before final removal took place. “I wanted to make sure that we removed noncitizens while protecting citizens’ right to vote,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Congress, House Republicans reintroduced the</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8281"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SAVE Act,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which would require all Americans to present documentary proof of citizenship for voting in federal elections. The House passed the bill, which does not address funding, in the last Congress, but it stalled in the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What States Are Doing</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not Congress acts, states absolutely are in high gear. In 2024, eight states amended their constitutions away from “every citizen” can vote to “only citizens” can vote. That brings to 15 the total number of states with explicit prohibitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What are states’ options as they consider ways to prevent noncitizen voting?</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond changing constitutional language, states can also rev up their</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-registration-list-maintenance"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter list maintenance processes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—all of which takes staff time. All states regularly scrub their voter rolls based on eligibility requirements of age, residency and citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last dozen years, states have sought ways to check citizenship, too—and it’s not an easy job, in part because there is no list of U.S. citizens anywhere. The federal Department of Homeland Security maintains a database—Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement, or SAVE—of those who are in the U.S. legally but who are not citizens. States can, after requisite agreements are completed, check individual registrations against the database if they have that person’s “alien registration number.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option: require new voters to show proof of citizenship when they register. For most new voters, that isn’t a problem; they show a birth certificate or passport at the bureau of motor vehicles to get a REAL ID, and that proof can be used for voter registration. (The REAL ID is not itself proof of citizenship, because they are available to noncitizens who are in the U.S. legally; it is the underlying document shown by a citizen to obtain a REAL ID that can be used for voting purposes.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a rare person who carries their birth certificate or passport when they go to the grocery store or public library, so if someone with a clipboard asks them to register, proof won’t be available. However, states can be sure the form asks for the driver’s license number, state ID number or last four digits of a Social Security number so that before those paper registrations are accepted, officials can check the numbers to verify that proof has been offered previously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some citizens, however, do not have a birth certificate or passport. Perhaps they were born at home decades ago and a birth certificate was never created. Or their copy was destroyed and never replaced. Over 9% of voting-age U.S. citizens say they can’t readily access documentary proof of citizenship, and just under 2% say they do not have any form of proof, according to a</span><a href="https://cdce.umd.edu/news/news-1-10-eligible-us-voters-say-they-can%E2%80%99t-easily-show-proof-their-citizenship"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2024 report, “Who Lacks ID in America Today: An Exploration of Voter ID Access, Barriers and Knowledge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” from the University of Maryland’s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Requiring Proof</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some say requiring proof of citizenship is voter ID redux, in that in the 2010s proof of identity—that is, voter ID for in-person voting&#8211;was the hot issue. The arguments may be the similar, but proof of citizenship is at the point of registration, not during voting itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona has required proof of citizenship since a statewide ballot measure, Proposition 200, passed in 2004. Those who can’t show proof of citizenship can’t vote in federal or state elections, with one exception. If those people used the National Mail Voter Registration Form, which does not require proof of citizenship, they can vote in federal elections but not state elections. (State law governs state elections; federal law governs federal elections.) Arizona refers to this as a “bifurcated” system, one set of ballots for those who can vote on everything and another set of ballots for “federal only” voters. The federal ballots come in nine versions, one for each congressional district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many people use the federal form? There are no national statistics. In Minnesota, “anecdotally, it would be a needle in a haystack,” says Paul Linnell, deputy elections director in the office of the Minnesota secretary of state. In 2023, Virginia received 1,735 federal forms out of about 300,000 new registrations, or 0.6% of the total.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona has been in almost nonstop litigation since enacting documentary proof of citizenship. As other states consider going that way, they may look to Arizona for legal lessons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, turn to Georgia, which passed a proof of citizenship law in 2009. In recent years, its automated voter registration and its adoption of Real ID in 2016 have proved helpful in reducing the likelihood that noncitizens could get on the rolls. “Everybody who comes to get a license or renews has to prove their citizenship for their information to get sent to the registrar,” says Blake Evans, the state’s elections director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia’s registration form also asks for the registrant’s driver’s license or state ID card number or, if those aren’t available, the last four digits of their Social Security number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evans says that for anyone who uses a paper form to register, their driver’s license or state ID number will be bounced against motor vehicle records to see if they have shown proof of citizenship. If they have not, the registration will be placed in “pending citizenship status” and they will be notified that they cannot vote unless they take action to prove their citizenship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Some Local Jurisdictions Permit Noncitizens Voting</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the trend is toward explicit language that prohibits noncitizens from voting, a countertrend is forming. Washington, D.C., and a smattering of local jurisdictions permit noncitizens to vote in local elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City was on that list, too, having enacted a measure in 2022 to allow noncitizens to vote in city elections. In February 2024, a state appeals court ruled the law unconstitutional. The law was never implemented and is on hold pending a possible appeal.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.immigrantvotingrights.com/cities-with-rights"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigrant Voting Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an advocacy group, lists 17 jurisdictions that allow immigrants to legally vote in local elections: 10 municipalities in Maryland, three in Vermont, two in California, New York City (though not currently in effect) and Washington, D.C. Except in the Maryland towns and San Francisco, these rules have all passed since 2020.</span></p>

At this point, the agency has frozen all of its work in election security and according to Wired, in a memo sent Feb. 14 to all CISA employees, CISA’s acting director, Bridget Bean, said she was ordering “a review and assessment” of every position at the agency related to election security and countering mis- and disinformation, “as well as every election security and [mis-, dis-, and malinformation] product, activity, service, and program that has been carried out” since the federal government designated election systems as critical infrastructure in 2017. “CISA will pause all elections security activities until the completion of this review,” Bean added. The agency is also cutting off funding for these activities at</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the EI-ISAC. “It is necessary to rescope the agency&#8217;s election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,” she told employees in the memo. The top Democrats on the Senate and House committees overseeing election legislation </span><a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/ranking-members-padilla-morelle-demand-answers-after-trump-administration-moves-to-fire-federal-employees-who-fought-election-misinformation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote a letter last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to CISA’s top leaders to express “grave concern” over the changes and request more information about how those changes will affect election security. Additionally, new Attorney General Pam Bondi</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-sanctions-trump-treasury-doj-bondi-85ccedf25d5146db74d83dce01c9958c"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disbanded an FBI task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on investigating foreign influence operations, including those that target U.S. elections. She</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1388541/dl"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the changes would “free resources to address more pressing priorities, and end risks of further weaponization and abuses of prosecutorial discretion.” According to </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-election-security-fbi-cisa-foreign-interference-98f1e17c8a6d5923db945a27f06458e7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by The Associated Press, the actions send a message that securing U.S. elections against interference from countries such as Russia, China and Iran is no longer a federal government priority, said Larry Norden, an election expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. “I think we would be naive to think that the bad guys don’t get that message, too, that there’s going to be less of a cop on the beat to protect our elections,” he said.</span></p>

The erroneous messages sent by email to Los Angeles County and Orange County voters arrived with a subject line that read “One Week Left to Return Your Ballot,” and told voters that “is the last day for your ballot to be mailed and postmarked,” omitting the day. Reminders sent by text message said: “Drop your ballot at a nearby drop box or voting location by 8 pm on.” Elections officials said the incomplete messages originated with BallotTrax, the software that sends automated messages to voters about the status of their mail ballots. The Denver-based company has worked with the California Secretary of State since 2020. Steve Olsen, the president of BallotTrax, told the Los Angeles Times that the automated reminders should have gone out to about 100,000 voters in two legislative districts that include parts of Los Angeles, Orange, Kern and Tulare counties. Special primary elections are being held in those districts next week. “Due to a geo-targeting error, the reminder went out to many other voters,” Olsen said in an email. He said the company is still investigating and will send a retraction as soon as they determine which voters received the messages in error.

In this episode, hosts Eric Fey and Brianna Lennon speak with Trent Tripple in Ada County, Idaho. Trent was integral in implementing the new Ballot Verifier system in Ada County that allows voters to view ballot images and cast vote records side-by-side. They spoke about how this ballot verifier came to be, how it’s helped decrease distrust in elections in Idaho and how it’s won his office back time that used to be spent fielding public records requests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlights from the report include:   </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC formally approved the Election Supporting Technology Evaluation Program (ESTEP) as a permanent program and launched a certification program to test and certify electronic poll books. Pilot evaluation programs were also put into development for election night reporting platforms, electronic ballot delivery systems, and voter registration systems. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC’s Testing and Certification program has three systems in VVSG 2.0 testing &#8211; VotingWorks Vx Suite 4.0, Hart InterCivic’s Verity Vanguard 1.0, and Smartmatic’s VSR1 2.1. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC’s Field Services Program conducted post-certification quality monitoring tasks of voting equipment, including 54 hash verification requests, training to local election officials on hash validation best practices, and completion and documentation of two projects in Douglas County, Nebraska, and Hawaii.   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC distributed $55 million in HAVA Election Security Grants and awarded a total of $1 million in Help America Vote Act College Program grants to 21 recipients from across the country. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EAC training resources were expanded with over 1,100 election officials from 33 states and territories participating online or in-person on topics like accessibility for voters with disabilities, communications, poll worker training, federal election laws, standard operating procedures, managing stress in the workplace, and more.   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commissioners traveled to 36 states and four territories to meet with election officials and share information on the EAC. International relations were also a focus, with the commissioners traveling to 10 countries and the EAC hosting international election officials and representatives.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An EAC study, “Voting Experiences Since HAVA: Perspectives of People with Disabilities,” showed that election officials’ significant efforts to serve all voters. The gap for participation between voters with and without disabilities is narrowing, but there is still work to be done to close this gap. </span></li>

In response to the shifting landscape created by U.S. Supreme Court decisions that have stripped away some of the most important protections of the federal Voting Rights Act (VRA), some states have taken a renewed interest in putting their own voting rights protections in place. Although there are some differences between the eight states that currently have Voting Rights Acts in place, there are key requirements that advocates and lawmakers should consider when designing new laws in other states: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preclearance Requirements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vote Dilution and Denial Protections</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protections Against Voter Intimidation and Election Interference </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This policy brief outlines the increasing need for state-level protections to fight voter suppression and racial discrimination, explains how these policies have developed over time and how they differ between states, and offers a rundown of current proposals in the 2025 legislative session. As of January 2025, at least six states are considering legislation that would implement state Voting Rights Acts for the first time:  Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey. Voters are no longer able to count on the most crucial and effective parts of the federal Voting Rights Act to protect their voting rights through the courts. Beyond that, a new administration in Washington has been clear in stating its commitment to restrictive policies on voting and elections, making state-level protections more critical than eve </span></p>

This allows the sponsors to begin gathering signatures.  Sponsors of the referendum will need to collect at least 34,099 signatures of registered voters, including minimum numbers of signatures in at least 30 of the 40 state House districts, to place the measure on the ballot in 2026.  Proponent Bernadette Wilson of Anchorage said it was important to get started early in the 2026 election cycle due to the large number of needed signatures. She is one of three primary sponsors, along with Judy Eledge of Anchorage and Ken McCarty of Eagle River.  Wilson pointed out that the 2024 ballot measure to repeal the voting system lost by a narrow margin — just 737 votes of 320,985 ballots cast.  Wilson said the sponsors feel good about their chances next time, saying that some voters were confused about what a yes or no vote meant on the question. She noted that opponents of repealing the system raised nearly $15 million, compared with roughly $150,000 raised by repeal supporters.</span></p>

The proposed measure, in OR 25-012, was largely a cleanup of election procedures at polling places along with approval for candidates to have 200-word statements rather than being restricted to 100 words on election materials. It was sponsored by assembly person Dimitri Fonov. However, there was criticism on part of the original measure that would have allowed some results of hand counts to be known before polls closed. Assembly member Stephanie Nowers proposed the amendment be removed, which was adopted. Now results will only be released after polls close at 8pm. A number of people showed up at the meeting expecting to testify against an earlier provision in the election code, since changed, that would have allowed devices to count paper ballots, like tabulators, to verify hand-counts. At the start of the meeting, Mayor Edna DeVries explained that the matter had been dealt with earlier in another piece of legislation.</span></p>

Katie Hobbs. Reforming the ballot counting process is a priority this session for Republicans, who control both chambers of the Legislature. “As promised, the first bill being sent to the governor this year is an election integrity measure,” Senate President Warren Petersen said in a press release after his chamber passed</span><a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/billStatus/BillOverview/81604"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB1011/HB2703</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Recent polling shows most Arizona voters want us to take action to speed up vote counting. We are providing our citizens exactly what they’ve asked for.” The Senate passed the legislation a day after the House, with both votes going along party lines. Chief among the provisions of the bill passed Thursday is a new deadline of 7 p.m. on the Friday before Election Day for dropping off early ballots at a voting location. It wouldn’t affect the deadline for early ballots returned by mail, which must reach election offices before the polls close at 7 p.m. on Election Day. Hobbs has </span><a href="https://ktar.com/arizona-politics-news/katie-hobbs-veto-election/5666710/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the bill. </span></p>

Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat and sponsor of</span><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25-001"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 25-1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said the Colorado Voting Rights Act is necessary since the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 is “under attack.” Several court decisions have weakened the federal VRA over the last decade, and there’s growing concern that President Donald Trump’s administration could try to further erode its protections.  The Colorado bill would mirror the VRA to “prohibit election practices that create disparities in participation for communities of color and other protected groups,” Gonzales said. It also includes protections for LGBTQ+ voters, expands multilingual ballot access, and requires accommodations for people with disabilities at residential facilities. The state attorney general could enforce voting rights under the Colorado measure, so “we don’t have to rely on the federal government or federal courts,” Gonzales said. The provisions of the bill would apply to all state and municipal elections. Voters whose rights are violated under the act can take action along with civil rights groups.</span></p>

The change will be up for a final vote by the council on March 4. Council member Julie Pignataro, who serves on the Election Code Committee that recommended this change and several others, noted there is a conflict between city code and Fort Collins City Charter that could potentially lead to lawsuits if a write-in candidate were to win. City code provides guidelines for becoming a write-in candidate, but the city charter says a candidate can take office only if they are &#8220;nominated,&#8221; meaning they must gather the signatures of at least 25 registered electors. &#8220;If a write-in candidate ever won, I think that could be legally challenged in court and then that person would have to step down,&#8221; she said. Mayor Jeni Arndt said it&#8217;s &#8220;misleading to the public to allow them to run for an office when our charter says you have to be nominated. If I were the write-in candidate who prevailed in an election and then was told, &#8216;No, you weren&#8217;t nominated but we let you do it anyway,&#8217; I&#8217;d see a lawyer.&#8221;</span></p>

The bill was amended to allow the secretary of state to enter into other intra-state compacts for voter list data. Secretary of state’s office officials and various voting rights advocacy groups defended the ERIC system as a way to maintain accurate voter rolls and cautioned that leaving the system would be costly and inefficient for the state. Georgia now spends about $97,000 annually as one of 24 members of the election registration database. The bill now advances to the full House Governmental Affairs Committee after advancing by a party-line vote Tuesday.</span></p>

If it passes, people would be automatically registered to vote by the county clerks when they submit their information to receive their ID.

The House Judiciary Committee voted 14-5 along party lines to pass</span><a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=91&amp;ba=HSB37"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Study Bill 37</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making it eligible for debate by the full House. Under the bill, the information displayed on a driver&#8217;s license or nonoperator ID must specify someone&#8217;s &#8220;status as a citizen of the United States or status as a noncitizen authorized to be in the United States.&#8221; The person&#8217;s citizenship status would be displayed on the back of the driver&#8217;s license or ID card. The bill&#8217;s Republican backers say the legislation will help make it easier to determine someone&#8217;s citizenship when they go to vote. &#8220;There are numerous different reasons this has come forward,&#8221; said Rep. Skyler Wheeler, R-Hull. &#8220;One of the most prevalent would be when it comes to certifying you’re a citizen when you vote, but it also can help in cases such as jury duty, as well as identity theft, international incidents and some advanced security.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers considered a bill that would require Iowans to </span><a href="https://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/new-iowa-bill-enforces-time-restraints-to-declare-party-affiliations-before-primary-caucus-require-partisan-candidates-to-register-with-political-party-for-at-least-a-year"><span style="font-weight: 400;">register with a political party 30 days before a primary or caucus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Currently, Iowans can change their party affiliation on election or caucus day. Exceptions would include if someone has never voted before, or they were registered as a no-party voter. &#8220;There were a lot of concerns that came up, you know, Democrats who were switching parties as they came into the caucus process,&#8221; State Rep. Derek Wulf (R- Hudson) the bill&#8217;s manager said. &#8220;There was a lot of discussion around, was there going to be some sabotage efforts. I don&#8217;t know if we saw that widespread, but I know that concern came up and that&#8217;s really what this bill spawned out of.&#8221; Opponents claimed there are lots of voters continuously changing their minds on which party they plan to vote for, and say this bill would negatively impact Iowans&#8217; political freedom. They also cited concerns that election workers could face backlash. &#8220;As I read this bill, you are exposing election workers to real harassment,&#8221; Rosie Thierer, an election worker said. &#8220;I will face a voter who will be very frustrated and angry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3684" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kansas-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Kansas:</strong> As of Feb. 12, lawmakers in Kansas had</span><a href="https://news.ballotpedia.org/2025/02/13/republican-led-election-policy-bills-advance-in-kansas-legislative-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduced 26 bills related to elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and four of these bills had passed a legislative chamber. In 2024, just one bill related to elections became law in Kansas. Bills legislators have advanced this year would make more consequential changes to the state’s election laws. Some of the topics align with legislation Republican-controlled state governments adopted elsewhere in recent years, while others are emerging as possible Republican priorities moving forward. On Feb. 6, Kansas lawmakers voted 29-10 to advance</span><a href="https://legislation.ballotpedia.org/elections/bill/14519"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB 6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a bill that would ban the use of ranked-choice voting for elections at any level. The vote was largely along party lines, with all but one Republican voting to advance the bill, and all Democrats opposed. On Feb. 11, Kansas lawmakers passed</span><a href="https://legislation.ballotpedia.org/elections/bill/14916"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB 4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of the state senate by a 29-10 vote. The bill advanced almost entirely along party lines, with one Republican and all Democrats opposing passage.  The bill would require that voters return absentee ballots by 7 p.m. on the day of an election. Currently, state law requires that voters return their ballot in-person on the day of the election, or postmark their ballot by Election Day. The state counts ballots postmarked by Election Day if received by the third day following an election. </span><a href="https://legislation.ballotpedia.org/elections/bill/15187"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HCR 5004</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would refer a constitutional amendment to the state’s voters asking them whether to modify the state’s constitution to more explicitly prohibit noncitizens from voting in elections in the state. Currently, noncitizens are not allowed to vote in any elections in the state, and the constitution stipulates that an individual must be a U.S. citizen to vote in elections in the state. The amendment would add language that explicitly states that no person who is not a U.S. citizen will be allowed to vote in the state. The other bill,</span><a href="https://legislation.ballotpedia.org/elections/bill/15095"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would require the director of the division of motor vehicles to provide a quarterly report to the secretary of state that includes details about noncitizens issued a driver’s license.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House granted first-round approval this week to a bill requiring county election officers to </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2025/02/18/kansas-house-endorses-bill-allows-new-information-source-to-cull-voter-registration-lists/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rely on online obituaries as well as other sources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when determining whether an individual should be deleted from voter registration records. Existing Kansas law directed officials in the state’s 105 counties to reference obituary notices printed by a local newspaper, the state’s weekly list of death certificates and the Social Security Administration’s annual death index when scrubbing registration lists. Consideration of the bill didn’t inspire rigorous debate among representatives on the House floor, and was advanced to final action on a voice vote. “Really all we’re doing is modernizing the statute to allow county elections officers to remove somebody from the voter roll if they appear in an online obituary,” said Rep. Brian Bergkamp, R-Wichita. The bill was introduced on behalf of Secretary of State Scott Schwab, whose office said the change would recognize fewer obituaries were published in newspapers and were increasingly likely to be posted online by funeral homes. Schwab is among Republicans considering a run for governor in 2026. “Only county election officers have the authority to remove voters from county rolls,” said Clay Barker, general counsel and deputy secretary of state for Kansas. “They must exercise prudence to ensure a complete and accurate match before removing any individual from the voter rolls.”</span></p>

As stipulated by the state constitution, the</span><a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2025/01/06/conservative-group-behind-voter-id-effort-submits-170k-signatures-to-get-on-november-ballot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will now go to the Maine Legislature for consideration, which can either enact the bill as written or send it to a statewide vote in November 2025.  Maine requires identification and proof of residency in order to register to vote but is among 15 states that do not require voters to present identification while at the polls. The petition only needed 67,682 signatures, which is 10% of the total votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election, to be valid. After reviewing a little more than half of the petition forms submitted, Bellow’s department found nearly 87,000 valid signatures.  In total, the campaign submitted more than 171,500 signatures to the Bureau of Corporations, Elections and Commissions on Jan. 6, according to the Department of the Secretary of State. Bellows has raised concern about the changes the Maine petition seeks beyond requiring ID at the polls, calling the petition “a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”  Bellows pointed to provisions that aim to roll back ongoing absentee voting, which allows voters to have absentee ballots mailed to them automatically for each election cycle, and remove the option for municipalities to get approval for multiple ballot drop boxes as changes that would make voting harder.</span></p>

Jheanelle Wilkins, a Democrat and vice chair of the committee, </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/policy/maryland-lawmakers-discuss-voting-access-and-election-reforms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">people convicted of a felony and serving a prison sentence could be allowed to register to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Republican delegates, however, questioned the logistics of the bill, which would allow incarcerated people to register to vote in the place they consider to be their residence, or the last known address for people serving life sentences, Wilkins said. “It’s really hard to tell when someone’s in jail for five years, seven years, 15 years, where they’re going to live the day they get out because they don’t know until the very end of their time,” said House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, who represents Allegany County. “The life that they had before they got incarcerated, that may be gone — their family, their connections to that community, may not exist anymore.” The measure is one of several bills Maryland lawmakers are considering this year to change election laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 66 and House Bill 781 would require the state board of elections to create guidelines for local boards to accommodate and</span><a href="https://www.governing.com/policy/maryland-lawmakers-discuss-voting-access-and-election-reforms"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expedite voting for older people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and people with disabilities through dedicated lines, signs and priority seating. Election judges would also receive training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 615 and House Bill 816 would make ballot questions posed to voters easier to understand by </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/policy/maryland-lawmakers-discuss-voting-access-and-election-reforms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eliminating legal jargon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and adding a statement to explain the outcome of each choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 253 and Senate Bill 991, would automatically </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/policy/maryland-lawmakers-discuss-voting-access-and-election-reforms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">send absentee ballots to registered voters in pretrial detention at correctional facilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without them having to submit absentee ballot applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 91, sponsored by Del. Bob Long, a Baltimore County Republican, would require in-person voters to prove their identity by showing a</span><a href="https://www.governing.com/policy/maryland-lawmakers-discuss-voting-access-and-election-reforms"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> government-issued photo ID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a non-government ID and documents proving a voter’s name and address to an election judge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 67, also sponsored by Long and other House Republicans, would prohibit local boards of elections from removing </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/policy/maryland-lawmakers-discuss-voting-access-and-election-reforms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">absentee ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from return envelopes unless they’re signed by the voter it was issued to, excluding uniformed service members serving overseas. Signatures would be verified by comparing the signed envelope to a voter’s registration record.</span></p>

SF 1071 is a legislative attempt to allow counties, cities, and school districts the option to adopt</span><a href="https://hoodline.com/2025/02/minnesota-senate-committee-advances-ranked-choice-voting-bill-paving-way-for-electoral-reform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for both odd- and even-year elections, potentially altering the established one-person, one-vote protocol. As reported by the Senate DFL, Carlson advocates that this bill &#8220;strengthens democracy, promotes local control, and allows voters to have a stronger voice in our elections.&#8221; By a narrow 6-5 margin, the committee passed the bill, advancing it to the scrutiny of the State and Local Government Committee where the dialogue will undoubtedly continue. Carlson&#8217;s measure is not without its challenges, yet within the halls of decision, the bill indeed found just enough favor to proceed down the legislative maze. Receiving such a close vote echoes the delicate balance of opinions that currently enshroud the ranked-choice voting conversation.</span></p>

House Constitution Chairman Price Wallace, a Republican from Mendenhall, told Mississippi Today let the measure die by the legislative deadline because he believed the Senate would not be receptive to any ballot initiative proposal.  “They’re not taking it up on that end of the building, so there’s no sense in us fighting about it down here,” Wallace said of the Senate. This would be the fourth straight year that lawmakers at the Capitol have been unable to agree on restoring the ballot initiative after the state Supreme Court in 2021 ruled the state’s initiative was unworkable because of the signature-gathering process.  Despite the Mississippi Constitution explicitly stating that voters still have a right to offer amendments through an initiative process, citizens have no process to change state laws or the state Constitution.</span></p>

A bill from House Republicans, including local Rep. Jose Cambrils from Loudon, would prohibit undeclared voters from changing their affiliation the same day as the primary to cast their ballot. The longstanding practice for undeclared voters is to register with a specific party at the polls during a primary and then switch their registration back right after voting.</span><a href="https://gc.nh.gov/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=158&amp;inflect=2"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 172</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would repeal the laws that allow that, making it so undeclared voters would need to change their party by the regular deadline – which is months in advance – to register to vote in a primary. It would still allow new and first-time voters to register on the day of the election. John Sellers, the bill’s prime sponsor from Bristol, said the idea of a primary is to let members of each party select their candidate, not members of the opposite party seeking to skew results. “What happens is … on primary day, maybe the other party has a strong candidate so the person in that party will actually literally go and register for the other party,” Sellers said. “And they’re undeclared, so they might normally vote one way but they decided on this primary to vote another way. It actually skews who actually gets elected to go forward for the general.”</span></p>

It would only allow groups or individuals to hand out sample registration forms instead. The measure would also require groups conducting voter registration drives to register with county boards of elections, disclosing the scope and date of their planned activities. The author of the bill, Rep. Harry Warren, R-Rowan, says the primary reason for it is “to protect people’s personal information and to reduce their exposure to possible identity theft.” He said it will bring accountability and uniformity to voter registration efforts, citing cases of discarded voter registration forms that were never turned into elections offices. Ann Webb, policy director for voting-rights group Common Cause NC, said the proposal would criminalize voter outreach efforts conducted by groups across the political spectrum. “This will disenfranchise voters,” Webb told WRAL News. “It&#8217;s an extreme bill that will prevent community organizations from supporting other community members directly in registering to vote, and that can only be viewed as an effort to make it harder to access voting.”</span></p>

Those include several reasons such as illness, disability, military service, religion, and age. “What’s the purpose here? What are we trying to solve?” said Rep. Mickey Dollens, D-Oklahoma City. “We know in the last presidential election there is no cases of absentee voter fraud. So I think the purpose of this is to make it harder for people to vote.” Dollens, who is also in the Election and Ethics committee, voted against the legislation. He said the bill was cumbersome and required an explanation every time an absentee ballot was requested. Other lawmakers questioned if the move would do more harm than good by discouraging absentee ballots. Lawmakers ended up voting in a 3-3 tie on the legislation. Speaker Pro Tem Anthony Moore, who was not at the meeting for discussions, came in and casted the deciding vote, voting for the bill. It will now move forward.</span></p>

They voted 47-22 for</span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25736"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 1066</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would require a person to live and usually sleep in South Dakota for “</span><a href="https://www.keloland.com/news/capitol-news-bureau/house-wants-tighter-laws-on-voter-registration-petitions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least 30 consecutive days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” in order to be considered a resident for voter-registration purposes. Adding the word “continuous” would be a change from current law that says the person must live “within the state for at least thirty days prior to submitting the registration form.” Republican Rep. Tony Kayser is the prime sponsor. He was questioned by Republican Rep. Kent Roe about how the change would affect over-the-road truck drivers and others who, according to Roe, likely wouldn’t be in South Dakota for 30 days in a row. “Nothing changes. The truck driver has to have some place they revert to,” Kayser answered. “It carries with you as you go.” Roe said he would vote no because he fears “an unintended disenfranchisement of certain people.” The</span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25736/281533"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House State Affairs version</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of HB 1066 now heads to the Senate, where Republican John Carley is lead sponsor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans also heavily supported a proposed change in </span><a href="https://www.keloland.com/news/capitol-news-bureau/house-wants-tighter-laws-on-voter-registration-petitions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law regarding gathering signatures </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to place a constitutional amendment on the South Dakota election ballot. Current state law says, “All measures proposed by initiative shall be presented by petition. The petition shall be signed by not less than five percent of the qualified electors of the state.” Republican Rep. Rebecca Reimer wants to change the requirement, so that sponsors of proposed constitutional amendments would need signatures from 5% of registered voters in all 35 of the Legislature’s Senate districts. She closed with two words about</span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25466"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 1169</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Vote green.” They did — 60-9 — to send the House State Affairs version to the Senate.

Hidalgo County commissioners unanimously passed a resolution in support of countywide voting after Dallas-area Republican Senator Bob Hall introduced a bill into the 89th legislative session that would ban it across the state. Hidalgo County’s resolution also opposes two other bills authored by Hall that call for the end of electronic poll books and marking devices. Hidalgo County uses electronic marking devices, which allow voters to cast ballots electronically and verify their choices on screen before printing a paper ballot “It allows the voter to make sure that all their selections are correct and that everything came out OK before they in turn take the ballot to their scanner where it is tabulated,” Salinas said. According to Salinas, getting rid of the electronic markers would mean changing the county&#8217;s election process, which would cost taxpayers. “It would cost millions,” Salinas said. “If it would revert back to direct recording electronic devices with a paper ballot on demand if you choose, either way we would have to update our system.&#8221;</span></p>

In its place, the state’s top election official would have the option to enter into agreements with other states to share information or contract with a different third party to maintain voter rolls. isonbee said the rest of her bill is also focused on acting on several recommendations legislative auditors listed in a recent audit report that concluded Utah faces no “significant fraud,” but found some errors on Utah’s voter lists. That audit found 1,400 “likely matches” to deceased voters that hadn’t been removed, with 700 that were marked as “active” voters. Auditors found that ballots were cast for two voters that matched as “deceased” in the November 2023 election.</span></p>

The bill mandates that the governor, in consultation with the secretary of state, identify additional state, local, federal and tribal agencies that can implement </span><a href="https://mynorthwest.com/mynorthwest-politics/bill-voter/4044929"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automated voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This includes agencies that collect personal information such as names, residential addresses, dates of birth and citizenship verification. The goal is to streamline the voter registration process by leveraging existing data from these agencies. The bill also authorizes the Health Benefit Exchange (HBE) to provide applicant information from the Washington Healthplanfinder to the SOS for voter registration purposes, contingent upon federal approval. Applicants will be notified and given the option to decline within 15 days; if they do not opt-out, their information will be used to register them to vote. Additionally, SB 5077 clarifies the role of the Department of Corrections in facilitating voter registration for individuals transitioning from incarceration. Registrations will be marked as “pending” until the individual becomes eligible to vote.</span></p>

It also directs the secretary of state, in validating signatures, to verify the address listed by a person on an initiative or referendum petition is the same as the one that is on their voter registration card. It passed the Senate State Government, Tribal Affairs and Elections Committee on a party-line 5-4 vote. In a statement, Secretary of State Steve Hobbs said anything that adds barriers or impediments to the initiative process “is not helpful to Washingtonians.”  “Adding a voter’s residential address to the process of validating voters’ eligibility to sign an initiative petition is unnecessary and won’t help voters in any demonstrative way,” Hobbs said.</span></p>

Senate File 33, “Noncitizen driver’s license and ID card-revisions,” requires creating a new driver’s license and state ID for those who are in the country legally, but are not a U.S. citizen. The bill is making steady progress through the general session, having passed through the Senate and crossed over to the House of Representatives. It barely passed the House’s Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee in a 5-4 vote, and has to pass three more readings on the House floor before it goes back to the Senate. There are an estimated 6,000 permanent Wyoming residents who are not U.S. citizens, according to expert testimony. It would cost the Wyoming Department of Transportation an estimated $67,000 to print the words “Not a U.S. citizen” on the back of these licenses and state IDs, according to the Legislative Service Office.</span></p>

The Senate Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee unanimously passed the amendment to House Bill 131, a bill banning ballot drop boxes in Wyoming.  Secretary of State Chuck Gray, who has supported HB 131, said he has to study the amendment more before issuing an opinion on it. Sen. Brian Boner, R-Douglas, brought the amendment. He indicated the amendment would help the bill advance through his committee. The committee passed HB 131 on a 3-2 vote, with Boner and Sens. Cheri Steinmetz, R-Lingle, Dan Dockstader, R-Afton, voting for it and Sens. Cale Case, R-Lander, and Bill Landen, R-Casper, voting against it. Boner believes having a slot to turn in ballots in the wall of a courthouse would be a more secure option than the ballot drop boxes, which although secured to the ground and under video surveillance, could still easily be harmed through a malicious act made by a member of the public.</span></p>

The attorney general’s office last month appealed a lower court dismissal of a lawsuit against the city over the voter ID requirement. But that appeal involved a narrower legal question of the timeliness of the legal challenge, which an Orange County Superior Court judge found was not yet ripe. Now the attorney general’s office and Secretary of State Shirley Weber want appellate justices to decide the merits of the entire case to speed up the legal process. If the attorney general had prevailed on the appeal filed last month, it would have likely led to the case being sent back to the lower court judge to decide the merits. “Secretary Weber and I continue to believe that Huntington Beach’s Measure A is unlawful,” Bonta said in a statement. “With preparations for the 2026 elections beginning late this year, time is of the essence.” City officials have maintained, as they have in other legal disputes with the state, that they have separate authority as a charter city. But state officials say state law supersedes any city ordinances that come into conflict. The state’s writ argues that the state lacks “an adequate, speedy remedy at law.” The writ also argues that the legal question is significant in that it involves the right to vote and the “constitutional separation of powers between charter cities and the state.”</span></p>

A probable cause statement filed on July 17, 2024, accuses former Lamb of financial misconduct, including forgery, fraudulent use of a credit device, and filing false documents. According to investigators, a review of Lamb’s county-issued business credit card revealed $8,126.51 in non-business-related charges and undocumented expenses. A forensic audit also found $1,336 in questionable mileage reimbursements, $200 in undocumented petty cash payments, and two extra payroll checks in 2022 totaling $6,278.40—exceeding her authorized salary. The Clay County Election Board placed Lamb on paid administrative leave on Oct. 11, 2023, before terminating her on Jan. 24, 2024. Authorities later attempted to contact her for an interview but believe she may have left the area or state. A warrant was issued for her arrest on Sept. 5 after she failed to appear in court.</span></p>

Callaway, a Democratic operative first charged a year ago, admitted in federal court in Camden Thursday that he and others paid individuals $30 to $50 to act as messengers for would-be voters. Callaway and his subordinates would fill those ballots before having them returned, the operative admitted. “The defendant admitted to depriving New Jersey residents of a fair election by participating in a scheme to cast ballots for voters who did not vote in the election,” said acting U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna. “Along with our law enforcement partners, we are committed to prosecuting those who criminally seek to undermine impartially conducted elections.” Numerous residents, in whose names mail ballots were cast and collected as part of the scheme, told authorities they did not vote that year or authorize Callaway, his subordinates, or others to cast ballots on their behalf. Callaway faces up to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $250,000, and three years of supervised release for the single charge of procuring, casting, and tabulating fraudulent ballots. Sentencing is set for June 17.</span></p>

But in yesterday’s petition, the state board of elections asked North Carolina’s highest court to bypass the court of appeals and take up the case in order to promptly resolve the weighty election-related matter that’s been proceeding for months.  “Immediate review is appropriate because the subject matter of this appeal has significant public interest, the appeal involves legal principles of major significance, and delay in this Court’s review is likely to cause substantial harm,” the petition reads. Riggs — who is recused from the case — expressed her support for the bypass petition, while Griffin said he opposes it.  If the justices grant the board’s petition and hypothetically deadlock in a 3-3 split on the merits of Griffin’s arguments, then the Wake County Superior Court’s denial of his challenge would remain in place. However, if the justices reject the bypass petition and allow the Republican-dominated court of appeals to hear the case first, then an evenly divided ruling from the high court would allow the appeals court’s ultimate decision to stand.</span></p>

Ranieri has sent a notice of errors to the Virginia Court of Appeals based on Circuit Judge Paul Dryer’s ruling that ordered former Electoral Board Chairman Curtis Lilly II and Vice Chairman Scott Mares to certify the November election results in the city. The pair, part of a conservative majority on the three-person board, had sued the Virginia Department of Elections in October saying that the use of vote-counting machines is unconstitutional because voting officials cannot witness the counting of ballots. They also argued that such machines are connected to the internet and can be hacked, which is not true. Lilly and Mares sought to withhold election certification until there could be a hand-count of the votes. Waynesboro residents countersued, arguing that their rights as citizens were being upended by the officials. Dryer sided with the plaintiffs, arguing that election certification is ministerial and not discretionary. The judge ordered the certification, saying “the court enjoins defendants from violating the plaintiffs’ constitutional right to have their legally cast votes counted.” Mares and Lilly have since left office. Mares finished his term in December and was not reappointed. The Virginia State Board of Elections last month held a hearing on Lilly and voted 5-0 to seek his removal. An affidavit provided to the state board by Waynesboro Director of Elections and Registrar Lisa Jeffers described the lawsuit by the two electoral board members as a “complete abuse of power.&#8221; Lilly, who served as chairman and then vice chairman, resigned from the Waynesboro Electoral Board two weeks ago. Ranieri said his goal in continuing the court fight is to bring more transparency to Virginia elections.</span></p>

Timothy Hazelo, 57, of Oak Harbor, was already facing a disorderly conduct misdemeanor for the Nov. 4 mask dispute at the Island County Elections office. In court documents filed last week, Island County Prosecuting Attorney Gregory Banks charged Hazelo with one count of unauthorized access to a voting center, a class C felony, as well as misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct and criminal trespass. In a sheriff’s arrest report, Island County Sheriff’s deputies said they responded to the county elections office on Nov. 4 after an election official said Hazelo was refusing to wear a mask in the room where ballots were being counted. The report noted there was a posted policy in the office that required workers and observers to wear masks. “It was determined Hazelo would be offered one final opportunity to comply with the policy set by the Island County Auditor to wear a mask in the ballot processing rooms, and if he continued to refuse to comply with the policy, he would be asked to exit the room,” the report stated. Body camera video of the encounter showed deputies telling Hazelo he had to leave the room or wear a mask. The deputy’s report alleged Hazelo turned to an election worker and said ‘I know who you are&#8221; before leaving the room. That worker told deputies he felt threatened by the comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5168" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Wisconsin:</strong> On a 4-3 vote the Wisconsin Supreme Court </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/state-supreme-court-dismisses-complaint-about-racines-early-voting-van/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected a lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">against the Wisconsin Elections Commission for not acting  against the city of Racine after the city used  mobile vans for in-person early voting in an election two years ago. The ruling, written by Justice Jill Karofsky and concurred in by the three other members of the Court’s liberal majority, declared that the voter who brought the case lacked standing to demand a judicial review of the commission’s decision. The case arose from a challenge to Racine’s use in the August 2022 primary election of a van that was sent around the city for early voting, also called in-person absentee voting, in the weeks before Election Day. For the primary election that summer, Racine’s city clerk designated 22 early voting sites: City Hall and 21 other locations around the city. The clerk’s office dispatched a van with election equipment to those 21 sites for which notices were posted. Voters could obtain absentee ballots, vote and return their ballots to the vehicle. On behalf of a Racine voter, the Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty, a right-wing law firm that has supported other challenges to local and state election practices, filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) charging that using the van for early voting violated state law. The commission rejected the complaint, and WILL filed a petition in Racine County Circuit Court for judicial review of WEC’s decision. Judge Eugene Gasiorkiewicz ruled in January 2024 in WILL’s favor that the early voting van favored Democratic parts of the city and violated state law. The judge held that the state law authorizing municipalities to establish alternate early voting locations applies to physical structures, not mobile vehicles. State law neither affirms nor prohibits mobile early voting sites, he wrote, but lacking “an express prohibition . . . does not mean mobile absentee ballot sites comport to procedures specified in the election laws.” The Supreme Court ruling sidesteps a direct interpretation of that question. Karofsky wrote that the voter WILL represented lacked standing to take WEC to court over the issue. State law authorizes an election official or a person who files a complaint “who is aggrieved” by a WEC order to take the matter to circuit court. Karofsky wrote that not everyone on the losing side of a WEC order is “aggrieved,” however, and that “to be aggrieved by a decision, one must have suffered an injury to a legally recognized interest as a result of the decision.” The plaintiff in the WILL lawsuit, Kenneth Brown, didn’t show he suffered or will suffer an injury, she wrote.</span></p>

In this deeply reported book, Katherine Stewart takes us to conferences of conspiracy-mongers, backroom strategy gatherings, and services at extremist churches, and profiles the people who want to tear it all down. She introduces us to reactionary Catholic activists, atheist billionaires, pseudo-Platonist intellectuals, self-appointed apostles of Jesus, disciples of Ayn Rand, women-hating opponents of &#8220;the gynocracy,&#8221; pronatalists preoccupied with the dearth of white babies, Covid truthers, militia members masquerading as &#8220;concerned moms&#8221; and battalions of spirit warriors who appear to be inventing a new style of religion even as they set about attacking democracy at its foundations. Along the way, she provides a compelling analysis of the authoritarian reaction in the United States. She demonstrates that the movement relies on several distinct constituencies, with very different and often conflicting agendas. Stewart&#8217;s reporting and comprehensive political analysis helps reframe the conversation about the moral collapse of conservatism in America and points the way forward toward a democratic future. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 20, 7pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://campaignlegal.org/events/antidemocratic-conversation-david-daley"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antidemocratic: A Conversation with David Daley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In 1965, voting rights advocates secured the passage of the Voting Rights Act. The law removed some discriminatory barriers that Black and other historically disenfranchised voters faced at the polls. From day one of its passage, however, this legislation has been attacked in state legislatures and the courts — most notably, the U.S. Supreme Court. In “Antidemocratic,” author David Daley outlines the beginning of a movement within the legal system that helped pave the way for the decision in</span><a href="https://campaignlegal.org/update/five-decades-section-5-how-key-provision-voting-rights-act-protected-our-democracy"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Shelby County v. Holder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Supreme Court case that gutted the Voting Rights Act. According to Daley, fringe theories about our elections threaten to undermine our democracy and silence voters. In a conversation with CLC’s Senior Vice President Bruce V. Spiva, Daley will discuss what pro-democracy advocates can do to protect the freedom to vote. <strong>When:</strong> Feb. 21, 1:15pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
<p><a href="https://esra-conference.org/2025-call-proposals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2025 ESRA Call for Proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The 9th Annual Summer Conference on Election Science, Reform, and Administration (ESRA) will be held in-person from Monday, June 9th to Wednesday, June 11th at Florida State University in Tallahassee, FL. The conference is interdisciplinary and invites participation from scholars across a variety of fields including political science, public administration, law, public policy, computer science, statistics, engineering and from election administrators. The purpose of the conference is to engage both election practitioners and scholars alike on pressing topics related to U.S. elections by providing a forum for collaboration and exchange that can stimulate policy evaluation and innovation. Unlike traditional academic conferences, ESRA seeks to facilitate a shared space between academics and election professionals so as to encourage the practical applications of scholarly research in the field. We hope that a wide variety of topics will be addressed at the conference. We are particularly interested in new and innovative projects that evaluate the way U.S. elections are currently administered and how they may be reformed. <strong>When:</strong> Deadline is Feb. 21. </span></p>
