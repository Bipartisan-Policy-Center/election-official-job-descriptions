							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Apply to be a Center for Election Excellence and become a Pathfinder! </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence is excited to announce the launch of the </span><a href="http://electionexcellence.org/our-community"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second cohort of Centers for Election Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; the Pathfinders!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first cohort drafted the voluntary, nonpartisan </span><a href="https://electionexcellence.org/about/values/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Values</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://electionexcellence.org/standards-for-excellence/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standards for Election Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now the Alliance is looking for a new cohort of election offices that will focus on researching what it takes to achieve the standards and chart pathways for the field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These offices will deepen understanding of what resources are required to run excellent elections, how much excellent election administration costs, and how achieving excellence impacts voters. And they’ll be first in line to pursue official recognition through the Alliance certification platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cohort will make improvements in their offices, tell the stories of their work, and advance the field of election administration. Together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election offices who join as Pathfinders will have access to a nonpartisan network of other election offices and subject matter experts across the country who are equally committed to continuous improvement.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://forms.electionexcellence.org/250335850850051"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply to join the Alliance as a Pathfinder today! The deadline to apply is Monday, March 31.</span></a></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12553" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-11.19.11 AM-300x199.png" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-11.19.11 AM-300x199.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-11.19.11 AM-768x510.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-05-at-11.19.11 AM.png 978w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the Pathfinder Cohort are committing to the Alliance nonpartisan value of voter-centricity. For example, a Pathfinder interested in working on poll worker excellence will receive information on how to lead an excellent poll worker training program, where voters interact with poll workers who are helpful, knowledgeable, and who build their confidence in the election process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, March 20th, we’ll be hosting two info sessions, one at 10AM CT and another at 2PM CT, where you can learn more about:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence and the Centers for Election Excellence</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to expect as a Pathfinder</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ways to stay involved with the Alliance</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://ctcl.jotform.com/form/210245706720043?usaee_webinar=1&amp;webinar_title=Pathfinder%20Cohort%20Info%20Session"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Register to join an info session today!</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe the Alliance has created a vision for what excellent U.S. election administration looks like. We hope you join as a Pathfinder and explore what your path to excellence can be!</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4548" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pennsylvania-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />New Reg System</strong>: This week, the Pennsylvania Department of State said that it signed a new $10.6 million contract with Louisiana-based technology company Civix to </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/pennsylvania/2025/03/05/sure-upgrade-voter-registration-system-new-contract-signed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upgrade the Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or SURE, and integrate it with other state-run election systems. The contract calls for Civix to integrate the functions of the SURE system with the state’s election night reporting, campaign finance, and lobbying disclosure systems, creating a system that the department called a “one-stop-shop elections administration experience.” The new system will include a public portal that will “serve as the centralized home” for those looking for guidance documents issued by the department, elections data, information about upcoming elections, and more, the department said in a press release. According to Votebeat, the state has been trying for years to upgrade the SURE system, which was built in the early 2000s. Local election officials complain that the system is outdated and has a tendency to crash, sometimes in the critical period just before an election when counties need it the most. Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt said the department decided to expand the SURE upgrade project to include other systems because he heard from the public and from state lawmakers about the need to also “make lobbying disclosure, campaign finance and election night reporting more user friendly.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5912" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/VT-Welcome-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Town Meeting Day</strong>: Town Meeting Day is dedicated to local elections across the state of Vermont. The original tradition brought voters together for an in-person debate and voice vote. While many communities continue to vote this way, others have adopted the Australian Ballot system. The </span><a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/australian-ballot-system-town-meeting-day/64027777"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian Ballot system </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">gives voters the opportunity to cast their votes anonymously, with a paper ballot. This can be more accessible for people who can&#8217;t attend a town meeting in-person. While some towns have used the Australian Ballot for years, others made the switch recently for their town meetings. In Milton, leaders say the Australian Ballot increases participation in local elections and moving away from in-person town meeting votes allows more people to have a say. “Town meeting is hard to get participation. And so to have it in person isn&#8217;t going to get the most response here in Milton,” said Kristin Beers, the town clerk of Milton. In Jericho, officials made the change to give more residents a chance to vote without attending a public meeting. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s people that are having trouble understanding, and there may be people that show up on Tuesday thinking that there is going to be an in-person town meeting and find out that there is not. But yeah, I think we’re in a place of transition,&#8221; said Jericho Clerk Jessica Alexander.</span></p>

He stepped into the role in the summer of 2022 after the Nye County Commission voted to move to hand counting ballots and his predecessor resigned. That fall, Kampf proposed a plan for Nye County to hand count during the midterm elections, which faced a </span><a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/nye-county-clerk-tempers-hand-count-expectations-calls-it-a-test"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the ACLU  and ultimately served as a parallel trial of hand counting. In March 2024, Kampf resigned from the position of Nye County Clerk. They spoke about these hand counting efforts, as well as Kampf’s work to beef up chain of custody processes during his tenure in office.</span></p>

							<h2>Ballot Measures, Legislation & Rulemaking</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7060" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Federal Legislation</strong>: House Democrats reintroduced the</span><a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/mountain/politics/2025/03/05/john-r--lewis-voting-rights-advancement-act-reintroduction-house-democrats"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this week. Supported by the entire House Democratic Caucus, the bill would require states that have a history of voting rights violations to receive federal approval before changing their voting laws. “Seemingly every day we see new efforts to roll back our hard-fought progress, efforts to whitewash our history and efforts to make it harder for Americans to vote,” Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala., said at a press event announcing the bill’s reintroduction. “Without the protections of the Voting Rights Act, those efforts are going unchecked in state legislatures across this country.” Sewell said state legislators proposed more than 300 bills in 2024 to make it harder for Americans to cast a ballot by closing polling locations, curbing early voting, ending vote-by-mail and imposing stricter voter identification requirements. More than 20 have been signed into law. The reintroduction of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act comes days before the 60-year anniversary of &#8220;Bloody Sunday.&#8221; Named for the late John R. Lewis, a civil rights icon who led the march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 and served in the U.S. House from 1987 until his death in 2020, the legislation would restore many of the protections of the 60-year-old Voting Rights Act.</span></p>

Kim Hammer (R-Benton), amended the bill and presented it to the committee again Feb. 27. Hammer announced in January that he will run next year for Secretary of State, the office that oversees elections.  The proposed “Document Validity Division” in SB 212 would have the power to “investigate documents and activities related to the validity and truthfulness” of petitions signed by registered voters in support of proposed ballot measures. “A document determined by the division to contain fraud or falsity by a preponderance of the evidence shall be declared null and void for any legal purpose overseen by the Secretary of State,” the bill states. The division would have subpoena power, and an amendment Hammer added to the bill this week would allow the agency to seek a court order to enforce a subpoena if the recipient fails to comply. SB 212 again failed to garner five votes from the eight-member committee. Sen. Clarke Tucker of Little Rock, the committee’s only Democrat, continued to oppose the bill, as did committee vice chair Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn. “I believe in a rigorous investigation of any wrongdoing when it comes to this petitioning process,” Payton said. “I believe it should be prosecuted and it should be investigated, but I also believe that our [nation’s] founders were very concerned with separation of powers… I believe that giving every agency police powers is a violation of the principle that we would have separation of powers.”</span></p>

The campaign, “at a minimum,” must inform students through regular mail and electronic mail, as well as social media and signs around campus, according to the measures. The identical bills address early voting, which in some places, like Orange County, drew long lines during the General Election.</span></p>

Senate Bill 303, filed late last week, seeks to revert Georgia elections to paper ballot statutes currently on the books. The bill directly addresses security complaints raised in federal and state lawsuits regarding the Dominion Democracy Suite 5.5 Ballot Marking Device (BMD) system, as well as comments by President Donald Trump about the integrity of U.S. elections. SB 303 would authorize the State Election Board to select a new voting system.

The Hawaiʻi Elections Commission oversees the state’s elections and has the power to hire and fire Hawaiʻi’s chief elections officer. The leaders of each political party in the House and Senate currently get to appoint four commissioners. The eight commissioners then pick a ninth member to be their chairperson. But Rep. Adrian Tam introduced a measure that would require the Senate to confirm the nominated commissioners. During that process, the public can submit testimony about the candidate because there is a formal hearing. &#8220;This allows for a little bit more transparency so the public can weigh in on who&#8217;s going to sit on this commission, because this commission is very important considering that they oversee election staff and election workers, and they oversee the chief election officer,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

The proposal comes from Rep. Austin Harris, (R-Moulton), and differs greatly from a recount reform proposed earlier this legislative session by Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, the state’s top elections official and also a Republican. Pate and lawmakers have sought updates to Iowa’s election recount laws since 2020, when a protracted recount in an Eastern Iowa congressional election revealed a patchwork of procedures across counties. It would limit recount requests to only those elections decided by 1 percent of the vote or less, and would require the candidate who requests a recount to pay for that recount unless the election margin was 0.1 percent or less. There is no current cap on an election margin before a recount can be requested. Under current law, the state pays for a recount when the margin is fewer than 50 votes or less than 1 percent. The candidate requesting the recount otherwise is responsible for posting a bond, but the bond is returned if the winner changes. The Iowa Secretary of State’s Office is officially registered as undecided on Harris’ bill, according to state lobbying records. So, too, are all other organizations registered on the bill, including organizations representing county auditors, counties and voters’ rights. Harris’ bill also would change the composition of election recount boards, which conduct recounts, by staffing them with local elections officials: the county auditor and the auditor’s staff.</span></p>

Kansas Senate Bill 273 proposes that all special elections be scheduled on the first Tuesday in March every year. County election officials from across Kansas expressed mixed opinions on how the bill could impact rural versus urban areas. Sumner County Clerk and Election Officer Debbie Norris said she sees potential benefits and drawbacks. “I can see a real positive in respect that when I have to reserve voting locations, I can tell them all in advance to reserve the building,” Norris said. In larger counties, however, the bill could address some administrative challenges. Harvey County Clerk and Election Officer Rick Piepho pointed out that counties like Sedgwick, which regularly hold multiple special elections, could benefit from consolidating them into one day. “Right now, Sedgwick County has three concurrent special elections,” Piepho said. “From an administrative standpoint, it’s like, why can’t all of these be on the same day?”</span></p>

This bill would</span><a href="https://www.wmdt.com/2025/02/new-legislation-could-allow-convicted-felons-the-chance-to-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> give incarcerated people the chance to vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Delegate of District 38C, Wayne Hartman, is completely against the idea. “I believe if someone cannot uphold the laws, and is in a position where convicted, they shouldn’t vote on people who create the laws.” Hartman said the imprisoned have not shown the responsibility to vote. “It’s certainly a privilege to vote, even our kids can’t vote. There has to be a degree of competence, some mental competence to vote.” While Hartman thinks voting is a privilege. Advocates from Common Cause Maryland disagree. Their executive director, Joanne Antoine, said it’s a constitutional right. “Voting is certainly not a privilege, it’s a right, and it should’ve never been taken away. I understand inside our facilities, these people have been held accountable and they should. According to Antoine, over 16,000 individuals in the state are incarcerated. If this legislation passes, Maryland would be the first state outside Washington D.C. to have the law. Antoine said while the bill is at a standstill, she will continue to advocate for those who need it. The bill has passed its first reading, but has not been referred to a committee for a second reading.</span></p>

The bill was approved Wednesday by the committee on a 6-5 party-line vote and sent to the House Public Safety Finance and Policy Committee. The bill’s proposed changes to election judge procedures would require: a county auditor or city clerk to notify the secretary of state’s office if there are not a sufficient number of election judges affiliated with a political party to meet the party balance requirements. The secretary of state must then notify party representatives and request that the party provide further names; and an appointing authority to maintain a list of election judges with their major party affiliation or a statement that the judge does not affiliate with a party. By law, cities, counties and school districts must retain all election materials for at least 22 months after an election. The bill would include registration forms and absentee ballot envelopes to the requirement and make it a felony to destroy or dispose of filled ballots before the end of that retention period. Entities that post unofficial election results on a public website must identify any precinct in which the vote totals are changed after the totals were first reported on the website, along with a notation indicating the number of impacted votes and the candidates for which those votes were cast; an explanation for the discrepancy; the date and time on which the discrepancy was discovered; the date and time on which the unofficial results were changed; and the initials of the elections official who made the change.</span></p>

I can promise you, you don’t want me bringing them into the polling place. They’d be knocking something over, and it would be a bad experience for all of us.” The plan passed the Elections Committee with no audible opposition, and it can now go before the full House for consideration.  Sanford’s proposal also establishes an early voting task force, although Sanford held a hearing over the summer to study the issue. It also allows election workers to process absentee ballot forms leading to Election Day.  To vote by absentee, a voter must meet one of around a dozen legal excuses, such as temporarily living outside of their county or being over 65. Mississippi law doesn’t allow people to vote by absentee purely out of convenience or choice.  The Senate passed a proposal, authored by Republican Sen. Jeremy Englad of Vancleave, that would have established 15 days of no-excuse, in-person early voting and required voters to present a valid photo ID to an elections worker.</span></p>

The hearing focused on four resolutions that would redefine how Missourians can alter the state’s highest body of law. Currently, the Missouri Constitution requires initiative petitions seeking to amend the constitution to have signatures equal to 8% of the legal voters in two-thirds of the eight congressional districts. Initiative petitions seeking to propose laws must have signatures equal to 5% of the legal voters in two-thirds of the eight congressional districts. State Sen. Jason Bean, a Republican from Holcomb, is sponsoring a proposed amendment to the Missouri Constitution that would require petitioners to gather signatures from 15% of voters in all of the congressional districts. Petitioners wanting to propose laws would need signatures from 10% of voters from all congressional districts. Bean’s legislation would nearly double the required amount of signatures in Missouri’s 4th Congressional District, which includes Boone County, to bring proposed laws and amendments to the ballot. The resolution would also raise the bar to pass initiative petitions. Amendments are enacted when they receive a majority of votes under current law. The legislation would still require amendments to garner a simple majority of voters to pass, but adds a requirement that the number of votes cast in favor is at least 35% of the total number of ballots cast in the election. If any of the proposed resolutions pass the legislature, changes would also have to be approved by Missouri voters next year.</span></p>

Under a proposed bill which passed the Montana House last week, those students might no longer have a say in local elections that impact their daily lives.  House Bill 413, introduced by Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, adds </span><a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2025/02/27/house-passes-bill-defining-residency-rules-for-voting-potentially-excluding-college-students/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">definitions to a section of Montana law related to residency requirements for voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and candidates for the Legislature. The law currently states that individuals cannot gain residency in a county if they are there for “temporary purposes, without the intention of making that county the individual’s home.” Calling the law vague, Gillette’s proposal defines temporary purposes as including “temporary work, training, or an educational program,” and includes requiring a voter’s intention to make the county an individual’s permanent home at the conclusion of their temporary purpose.  But many opponents to the bill said this could constrain, or outright remove, voting rights from thousands of students in Montana. The bill passed through committee on an 11-8 party line vote, and drew additional debate on the House floor. Gillette maintained her bill was simply about adding clarity to existing law, and that the goal was not to target specific populations or strip away students’ voting rights.  The bill passed third reading 56-42 and will next head to the Senate for further consideration.</span></p>

Currently, people can register and vote at county election offices until noon the Monday before an election and as long as polls are open on Election Day. The bill — sponsored by Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka — would eliminate registration on Monday and close it at noon on Election Day, but allow people to register on the Saturday before the election.</span></p>

Other bill opponents said the changes would introduce unnecessary burdens to voters and make it harder for Nebraskans to participate in elections.  Holdcroft said while he has confidence in the integrity of Nebraska elections, the bill is “simply to give peace of mind to the electorate and our state regarding the security of our elections.” Tracy Overstreet, Hall County Election Commissioner, said during the hearing that the proposed changes would require her to hire more staff and violate the federal National Voting Rights Act because of the way the bill would restrict voter registration by mail. According to the bill’s fiscal note, the changes Holdcroft seeks would cost the state nearly $1 million when Nebraska is facing a significant budget shortfall.</span></p>

Assembly Bill 306 would require Clark County to have 10 drop boxes available in the days after early voting ends and before Election Day. Nevada law requires all mail-in ballots to be mailed and postmarked by Election Day. There is then a four-day period after Election Day when county clerks can accept the postmarked ballots and process them. If the ballot does not have a postmark, county clerks can process ballots up to three days after Election Day. A law passed after the 2020 election allows Nevada county clerks and registrars to process mail-in ballots in the two weeks before an election. Democratic Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar told 8 News Now in January that delays in tabulation are not because of the post-Election Day mail, but rather mail-in ballots received at election centers on Election Day. The bill would require Washoe County to have five drop boxes and counties with populations less than 100,000 to have any number. Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager and Senate Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, both Democrats, introduced the bill with several colleagues.</span></p>

The Assembly voted 65-7 to approve legislation to eliminate the controversial county line from primary ballots. Thursday’s bill is a tweaked version of the bill the Assembly passed in December—the new vote was needed to bring the Assembly in line with legislation passed by the state Senate earlier this week. The legislation also eliminates the direct election of Democratic and Republican State Committee members in primary elections; instead, State Committee members will be elected by the county committee.</span></p>

The bill, signed into law this week, extends the state&#8217;s early voting period for primary elections from three to six days starting one week before Election Day and continuing through the Sunday prior. Presidential primaries in the state will also enjoy of a six-day early voting period. The nine-day early voting period for general elections remains unchanged, as does the three-day period for May municipal elections. The change follows a significant increase in early voting during the 2024 general election, with nearly 1.2 million residents casting ballots before Election Day, compared to just 213,919 the previous year. The new early voting schedule will be in place for the June 10 primaries, when voters will choose candidates for governor and the General Assembly. The bill allocates $6 million for its implementation.</span></p>

Griffin wants to throw out more than 60,000 voters&#8217; ballots, including thousands of ballots cast by </span><a href="https://www.wral.com/story/seeking-to-avoid-repeat-of-supreme-court-election-lawsuit-nc-lawmakers-eye-changes-for-overseas-voters/21890343/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overseas voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The state didn&#8217;t require overseas voters to show photo identification in 2024, even though most other voters did have to show ID. Griffin contends that&#8217;s wrong, and that their ballots shouldn&#8217;t count. No legislation would be able to shut down Griffin&#8217;s lawsuit as it plays out in the courts, but Democrats believe their proposal will at least stop future lawsuits from targeting overseas voters like deployed members of the military, by making it clear that they don&#8217;t have to show ID. The percentage of people voting overseas is small, but North Carolina is a closely contested swing state where even small margins can make a difference. Griffin trails Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs by just 734 votes, out of more than 5 million ballots cast. Rep. Marcia Morey, D-Durham, said her bill will make it clear that members of the military living and voting from other countries don&#8217;t need to go photocopy their identification and then mail it in, in order for their ballot to count. &#8220;We have thousands of military overseas, who reside in North Carolina,&#8221; Morey said in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s not as easy to just pull out your ID and find a copier if you&#8217;re in the field, if you&#8217;re somewhere where it&#8217;s difficult.&#8221;</span></p>

House Bill 1387 states that school districts need to either cancel classes or keep students segregated from the polling location if it’s inside the school. Sponsor Rep. Pat Heinert, R-Bismarck, says the bill originated as an idea from his daughter, who’s concerned about having public voters inside a school. “It is a safety factor. She has 482 kids in her grade school. They had about 1,800 voters that day during school hours. We got to stop that, I think,” said Heinert. Heinert says there are around 10 schools in Bismarck that are used as polling locations. A representative of the North Dakota School Boards Association says school buildings are regularly used for school elections, usually in June. The Senate took no action on the bill, but a floor vote could occur as early as Friday. It passed the House in an 85-8 vote.</span></p>

Particularly in the most rural counties. It was brought by prime sponsors Rep. Rebecca Reimer and Sen. Amber Hulse, both Republicans. Hulse said it’s a chance to add another layer of security. “In some counties that don’t have a website the way they notify the public these tastings are happening is not on a public website,&#8221; Hulse said. &#8220;So, unless you’re going into the county courthouse or going and looking at the notices that are being published, you’re probably not being notified this is happening. This just allows, if you’re going to the Secretary of State website, that it’s out there for the public statewide.” For Hulse, voting safety is the number one priority. “I’ve been working with a lot of the auditors and election officials on several different election bills,&#8221; Hulse said. &#8220;That’s what I do for my day job, in election and political law. We want to make sure there is transparency in terms of when the testing of the machines is happening.” The bill now heads to the Senate floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House has approved a bill that would require the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles to indicate on driver’s licenses, permits and state IDs </span><a href="https://www.sdpb.org/politics/2025-03-04/house-passes-bill-requiring-drivers-licenses-indicate-us-citizenship"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether or not someone is a U.S. citizen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Rep. Mary Fitzgerald is the bill’s prime sponsor. She said the purpose is to ensure non-citizens aren’t voting in South Dakota. “Senate Bill 75 is an election integrity bill and serves as a step in the right direction,&#8221; Fitzgerald said. &#8220;We want to make sure that we do have legal elections, and elections that we can have faith in and that we know that those are held legally.&#8221; Proponents also said it makes verifying citizenship easier for poll workers. </span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25723/283310"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 75</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed the House floor 66-4 and now heads to the Governor’s desk for a signature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5937" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UTCap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Utah:</strong> A proposal that would have taken </span><a href="https://kslnewsradio.com/elections-politics-government/changes-to-utah-election-oversight-bill/2187986/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oversight of elections </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">away from the office of the lieutenant governor has been changed, and passed out of committee with unanimous support. Rep. Ryan Wilcox, R-Ogden, said that his bill would create the role of an officer who oversees any race that poses a conflict of interest with the governor or lieutenant governor. Wilcox introduced the bill with concerns about a potential conflict of interest. The language of</span><a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/HB0369.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB369</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states that the bill: “&#8230;provides for the appointment of a conflict of interest elections officer to act in the place of the lieutenant governor if a complaint or election controversy arises that has any connection to a race for office in which the governor or lieutenant governor is, or seeks to be, a candidate.” HB369 would also create an oversight committee, which would review Utah elections and make recommendations to improve the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new</span><a href="https://le.utah.gov/Session/2025/bills/introduced/CP%20HB0300S02%20To%20HB0300S03.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> version</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of</span><a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/HB0300.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB300</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won approval from the Senate Business and Labor Committee on a 5-3 vote this week, advancing the bill closer to its legislative finish line. It now goes to the full Senate for consideration.  The latest version of HB300 would do the following: Starting in 2026, require voters with a valid state ID to include the last four digits of their state ID when returning a ballot through the mail or in a drop box. For registered voters who cast their ballot without an ID number, clerks would confirm their ballots by matching their signatures. Phase out Utah’s current automatic vote-by-mail system by 2029. In order to vote by mail, Utahns would be required to obtain a valid state ID by Jan. 1, 2029 and opt in to voting by mail. By that deadline, clerks would also be required to rely on confirming state ID numbers on ballots rather than signature verification. Allows Utahns who are eligible to register to vote that also sign an affidavit stating that they’re indigent to receive a state voter ID card free of charge. Beginning in 2029, voters who vote in person must present a valid ID, except in certain circumstances, in which a voter could sign an affidavit and present two forms of alternative ID (like a social security card, bank statement or paystub). By 2029, requires voters to opt in to receive by-mail ballots every eight years. Creates new ways for voters to opt in to voting by mail, including when renewing their driver’s license, voting in person, or through an online portal. Restrict Utah’s current deadline for by-mail ballots. Currently, Utah allows by-mail ballots to be postmarked by the day before Election Day in order for clerks to count them, but HB300 would require ballots to be in clerks’ possession no later than 8 p.m. on election night, regardless of their postmark. Enhances the lieutenant governor’s ability to investigate voter registration roll inaccuracies. Clerks still expressed concerns with the bill.  “While many changes have been made, there are still substantial hurdles that this bill brings forward,” Salt Lake County Clerk Lannie Chapman said, noting that in her county, more than 91% of voters have cast by-mail ballots. She also worried that the added requirements to review both the last four digits of voters’ ID, in addition to signature verification, will “at a minimum, double the amount of time” it will take for clerks to verify ballots.  “We’re not quite there yet,” Chapman said about the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another lawmaker’s efforts to clean up Utah’s voter rolls and make Utah the next state to break ties with a nonprofit that’s meant to keep states’ voter rolls up to date appear to have hit a dead end.  An earlier version of</span><a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/HB0332.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB332</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that won approval from the full House, sponsored by House Majority Whip Karianne Lisonbee, R-Clearfield, would have required Utah to end its membership with the national Electronic Registration Information Center, known as </span><a href="https://utahnewsdispatch.com/2025/03/04/utah-bill-to-require-voter-id-changes-again-effort-to-remove-utah-from-eric-stalls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERIC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit that helps states maintain their voter rolls by sharing information across state lines.  However, Lisonbee — likely anticipating an uphill battle for her bill in the Senate — changed her bill in this week’s Senate committee to strip out that provision. A new version of her bill would have also sought to require Utahns to have proof of U.S. citizenship in order to vote in a state election.</span></p>

The Senate on March 3 unanimously approved</span><a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_history.cfm?INPUT=50&amp;year=2025&amp;sessiontype=RS"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 50</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A similar bill,</span><a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_history.cfm?INPUT=2422&amp;year=2025&amp;sessiontype=RS"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2422</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is pending before the House of Delegates Government Organization and Local Governments committees.  The Senate bill, as it is now, would give West Virginia cities and towns until 2032 to change their ordinances and charters so that their local elections align with the state’s election cycles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process used to </span><a href="https://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/local-news/2025/02/west-virginia-senate-committee-approves-faster-inactive-voter-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">move voters to inactive status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could be moved up by two years under a bill being considered by the state Senate. The Senate Government Organization Committee recommended Thursday morning a committee substitute for Senate Bill 487, removing ineligible voters from active voter rolls, sending the bill to the full state Senate. SB 487 proposes changes to West Virginia’s existing systematic purging program for removing ineligible voters from active voter registration files. The bill would reduce the period of voting inactivity from four years to two years, meaning that voters who haven’t voted in any election during the preceding two calendar years and who haven’t updated their voter registration records would receive a confirmation notice from their local county clerk’s office and be moved to inactive status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new bill, Senate Bill 643, introduced by Senator Joey Garcia (D-Marion) aims to </span><a href="https://www.lootpress.com/west-virginia-senate-bill-seeks-to-restore-voting-rights-to-formerly-incarcerated-individuals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restore voting rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to individuals convicted of felonies in West Virginia once they are released from incarceration.  Under the proposed bill, people released from prison for felony convictions would automatically regain their right to vote, regardless of any ongoing probation or parole status. This bill seeks to amend the state’s voter registration laws to ensure that formerly incarcerated individuals are eligible to register and vote after their release. The bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate voted 31-2 in favor of the bill, which would </span><a href="https://www.wowktv.com/west-virginia-politics-2024/west-virginia-senators-pass-bill-banning-ranked-choice-voting-and-other-laws-impacting-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prohibit ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in West Virginia. The bill now moves to the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate approved Senate Bill 486 which was requested by the Secretary of State’s Office and aims to “clarify voter eligibility,” said Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Mike Stuart. “It first requires that a voter be both a </span><a href="https://www.wvnews.com/business/west-virginia-senate-passes-bills-to-restrict-electioneering-prohibit-non-citizen-voting-and-block-ranked/article_4f9bb43e-f8fb-11ef-8f87-5f6e69a1bd9e.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. citizen and state citizen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to vote in municipal elections,” he said. “The legislation also protects the voting rights of the elderly in West Virginia by ensuring that they are only disqualified from voting upon a formal court judgment of incompetency, and not a nursing home administrator.” The bill passed 33-0, with one member absent or not voting.</span></p>

These seven bills were among a laundry list that failed to make the deadline to be read for the first time Friday evening before the chamber adjourned. All of the seven bills passed by a large majority in the House. One of the seven bills banned ballot drop boxes in Wyoming, one of the cornerstones of Gray’s 2022 campaign. Due to next year being a budget session leading directly into an election year, it’s less likely ballot drop boxes will be banned for the 2026 election in Wyoming. Six of Gray’s 10 election goals have been passed by the Legislature and three election bills he supported have already been passed into law by Gov. Mark Gordon. Another four are waiting on his desk for approval.</span></p>

The Feb. 11 indictment accuses Jordan of disorderly conduct with a weapon, a felony charge, as well as two misdemeanors: disorderly conduct and false reporting to a law enforcement agency. Votebeat exclusively requested and obtained the indictment. Jordan, a Republican, defeated the Democratic incumbent, Michael Sample, in the Nov. 5 election. As recorder, Jordan controls voter registration and early voting in the northern Arizona county. State law prohibits anyone convicted of a felony from holding public office. Jordan, 46, allegedly pulled out a gun during a conflict with two 18-year-old men who had been tailing his truck in an SUV on Oct. 23, according to a report from the Show Low Police Department. The incident took place near the parking lot of his child’s school. He said in an interview with Votebeat that he pulled out the gun in self-defense after he “felt in fear for my life.”</span></p>

Dourbetas had previously ruled in December that the state’s lawsuit against Huntington Beach over Measure A would be dismissed, because the measure “was permissive and discretionary in character.” Therefore, he said it did not conflict with state elections law. California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta and Sec. of State Shirley Weber appealed, and a three-judge panel of the California Fourth District Court of Appeal recently suggested that the matter was ripe, kicking it back down to the Orange County court. Dourbetas’ order vacated his December dismissal of the state’s challenge, as he now holds that the voter ID provision presents a “ripe justiciable controversy.” “While the particular details of how voter identification will be implemented in municipal elections in Huntington Beach do not appear to be determined as of yet, the charter provision has been amended to permit imposition of voter identification requirements,” Dourbetas wrote. He invited the city to elaborate if it contends that it can implement a voter ID requirement that doesn’t violate the state elections code, or if voter ID is a local matter that charter cities could implement per the state Constitution. The next hearing in the case is set for April 3, in Dourbetas’ chambers, on the state’s petition for writ of mandate.</span></p>

The U.S. Department of Justice sentenced Richard Kantwill to 24 months in prison followed by 3 years supervised release and ordered him to pay a $10,000 fine, state officials said. The threat reportedly cited Griswold as the “number one target” in a purported investigation conducted by Kantwill. It included reference to targeted violence against her and used racist, misogynistic, sexist and vulgar slurs. State officials said the threat against Griswold was sent on Feb. 9, 2024, the day after the U.S. Supreme Court’s hearing of Donald J. Trump v. Norma Anderson, et al. Since this case was filed in Sept. 2023, state officials say Secretary Griswold has received over 2,300 violent threats or death threats. At least three other individuals have either been convicted of, or pleaded guilty to, making threats of violence toward Secretary Griswold, state officials said.</span></p>

Board members passed four separate motions finding Michael John Palombi, 34, </span><a href="https://mirrorindy.org/election-board-refers-voting-center-intimidation-incident-to-prosecutor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violated four Indiana election laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Among the four laws cited was the poll worker intimidation statute, Indiana Code 3-14-3-18, which was passed by the legislature in 2024 and made threatening an election worker a Level 6 felony. That offense is punishable by a sentence ranging from six months to two-and-a-half years and a fine of up to $10,000. The other laws the board determined Palombi had violated were the prohibition against intimidation of a person trying to vote, I.C. 3-14-3-21.5; the ban on obstructing, interfering, or injuring an election worker or a voter, I.C. 3-14-3-4; and the restriction on electioneering, I. C. 3-14-3-16. While the intimidation and obstructing laws are both Level 6 felonies, the electioneering law is a Class A misdemeanor. Ultimately Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears will make the decision whether to charge Palombi with violating any or all of the four election laws. In addition, the prosecutor will conduct his own investigation and could bring other, possibly criminal charges, according to Marion County Circuit Court Clerk and election board secretary Kate Sweeney Bell.</span></p>

Hasan is charged with 48 offenses related to the alleged fraudulent voting scheme, court records show. “The bedrock principle of democracy is free and fair elections,” Stollsteimer said in a statement. “Millbourne Borough Councilman MD Hasan violated that principle in 2021 by stuffing the ballot box with illegal votes in an effort to win higher office.” Hasan’s alleged effort fell short. He ultimately lost the low turnout election to Millbourne Mayor Mahabubul Tayub by about 30 votes. “Today, thanks to an exhaustive joint investigation [led] by my office and our partners at the FBI, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and the Delaware County Bureau of Elections, he is being held accountable for his criminal acts,” Stollsteimer said. Hasan</span><a href="https://www.delcotimes.com/2025/02/20/3-millbourne-officials-charged-federally-with-voter-fraud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also faces federal charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alongside Borough Councilmember Mohammed Munsur Ali and former Councilmember Mohammed Rafikul Islam.

The lawsuit, filed in the Western District of Tennessee, claims that the map adopted by Fayette County commissioners was chosen “at least in part with the intent to racially discriminate against Black voters,” violating the Voting Rights Act as well as Black Fayette County voters’ constitutional rights. “The facts are clear: The map unfairly targeted Fayette County’s Black population,” attorney John Cusick said in a news conference Thursday. “Although the Black voters make up more than a quarter of Fayette County’s population, they have zero representation on the 19-member, all-white county commission.” The Fayette County Commission adopted a redistricting plan with no majority-minority districts against the advice of its own redistricting committee and outside legal counsel. The state comptroller’s local redistricting guide requires county legislative bodies to consider minority representation while developing new districts. The commission rejected plans that included districts with majority Black voting age populations, in effect diluting the power of Black voters to elect candidates of their choice, the lawsuit states. The filing comes after the U.S. Justice Department sued the Fayette County Board of Commissioners in January, similarly alleging that the board violated the Voting Rights Act when it adopted the 2021 redistricting plan.</span></p>
