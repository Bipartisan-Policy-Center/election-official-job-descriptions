							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Kids Are Alright</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henderson, Nevada’s “Kids Vote” program engages thousands</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13082" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HendersonKidsVote-298x300.png" alt="" width="298" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HendersonKidsVote-298x300.png 298w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HendersonKidsVote-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HendersonKidsVote.png 522w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" />Building on the purpose statement “Connecting Our Community with Local Government” –  the </span><a href="https://www.cityofhenderson.com/government/departments/city-clerk/municipal-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henderson, Nevada city clerk’s office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created several initiatives around community outreach, particularly voter outreach, in its most recent strategic plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of these outreach initiatives was to involve children in voting in meaningful ways, through education and engagement activities. </span><a href="https://www.cityofhenderson.com/government/departments/city-clerk/elections/kids-vote-2024"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henderson Kids Vote 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the first of these initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to putting resources on the city’s elections website geared toward children, staff brainstormed ways to involve children in a manner that closely mimicked the voting process that they see their parents participating in, but on a level that they can understand and be excited about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was decided that staff would build out a voting booth and voting machine but with ice cream flavors as the candidates. The candidates would start with a larger pool that would be narrowed through the primary elections, leading up to the final winner at the general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our Kids Vote hours mirrored our regular early voting and election day hours during all three elections,” explained Chelsea Palacios, Lead City Clerk Services Specialist. “Logistically we decided to keep the City Hall voting site as the only Kids Vote location.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13083" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HendersonVotingBooth-213x300.png" alt="" width="213" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HendersonVotingBooth-213x300.png 213w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HendersonVotingBooth.png 542w" sizes="(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px" />They used an old iPad that was previously assigned to the Passports division as the voting machine and trying to create a realistic experience for the children, the city reached out to Clark County which gave them an old voting booth to use. The city maintenance team helped by cutting the legs down for a child height voting booth. They also created a paper roster to use for voter check-in, being mindful to only collect their first name, their signature and their age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Julie Chapman, CERA, Election Administrator, there were a few reasons for using an iPad instead of actual voting equipment. First, elections in Henderson are managed by Clark County so the city doesn’t have its own voting machines. Second, the city also  wanted to avoid any confusion or controversy. Using actual voting equipment for a lighthearted, kid-focused event, especially something like an ice cream-themed election, could have led to unnecessary scrutiny or even fueled conspiracy theories, Chapman said. She said it was important to clearly separate the Kids Vote from the official election process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lastly, we wanted to make the experience as simple and accessible as possible for children. iPads are intuitive and familiar to most kids, making them an ideal platform,” Chapman said. “They also allowed us to scale the program easily without burdening election staff. Using Microsoft Forms to build the ballot and tally results made the whole process quick and efficient. Plus, we were able to size the voting booths just right for little voters!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city partnered with the </span><a href="https://www.purplepenguinsnow.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purple Penguin Snowcone Shack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give away free ice cream to children who participated in the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They offered to give us coupons good for a free scoop of ice cream for each kid who voted in the PPP. I asked how many coupons they would be willing to donate and the answer was ‘No limit!’” Palacios explained. “In fact the owner was so pleased with the response during the PPP that he wanted to partner with us for the remaining two elections. Even though he ended up giving away a lot of ice cream, he still saw an increase in sales exclaiming ‘Best Tuesdays ever!’.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13084" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HendersonKidsIVoted-300x289.png" alt="" width="300" height="289" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HendersonKidsIVoted-300x289.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HendersonKidsIVoted.png 494w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />And we would be remiss if we didn&#8217;t note that in addition to free ice cream, all youth participants got their very own, custom Henderson Kids Vote 2024 &#8220;I Voted&#8221; sticker.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they didn&#8217;t have a set budget in mind, an effort was made to keep expenses low. In the end, the city spent approximately $2,500 total over the three elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks to our city&#8217;s Communications and Marketing Department all graphics, including designing a fabulous custom look, and printing the collateral was done in-house for free or at cost,” Palacios said. “We spent a small amount of money on an iPad stand, some decorations </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the voting booth and a 8&#8217;x8&#8242; banner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the target audience was primarily elementary school aged children the voting booth was open to anyone 18 and under, which created a fun loophole for some. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[The loophole] allowed 18 year olds to vote in both the “adult” election and the “ice cream” election” Palacios explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Henderson Kids Vote voting booth debuted during the Presidential Preference Primary with 117 kids casting ballots. The booth returned for the regular primary with 359 kids voting. And finally, the General Election Henderson Kids Vote voting booth saw 1,474 children make their final selections – cookies and cream was the ultimate winner, by the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans are already in the works for 2026. While there had been initial talks about possibly doing something other than ice cream – pizza toppings were mentioned and folks in the elections world know how passionate people are about those! – ice cream is back on the menu. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ice cream was a hit with kids and parents alike, and we had a fantastic community partner in the Purple Penguin Snowcone Shack. Given how well the program was received, we absolutely plan to bring it back for 2026, with ice cream on the ballot once again!” Chapman said. “We’re still finalizing the candidate list, but we’ve heard whispers that the reigning champion, Cookies and Cream, may not be returning to defend the title. That said, there are a few exciting new challengers (flavors) gearing up for a fun and friendly campaign. Stay tuned!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapman also had some advice for other cities and counties considering something similar. Keep it simple and fun! She said parents appreciated that the process was quick, easy, and located conveniently next to our ice cream partner, which made for a fun outing. Also, a photo-friendly backdrop was a small investment that made a big impact. Parents loved snapping pictures of their kids “voting,” and those photos became organic advertising on social media. And lastly, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[S]taffing matters! If your Kids Vote location is near a busy vote center, try to assign a dedicated staff member to oversee the Kids Vote station, especially during peak non-school hours,” Chapman advised. “Having someone focused solely on that experience helps ensure everything runs smoothly and that families feel welcome and engaged.”</span></p>

According to The Post, the Trump administration and its allies have launched a multipronged effort to gather data on voters and inspect voting equipment, sparking concern among local and state election officials about federal interference ahead of the 2026 midterms. The Justice Department has taken the unusual step of asking at least nine states for copies of their voter rolls, and at least two have turned them over, according to state officials. In addition, two DOJ lawyers have asked states to share information about voters to implement a Trump executive order that would shift some power over elections from the states to Washington. Courts have temporarily blocked key provisions of that order, including changing mail ballot deadlines and requiring voters to provide proof of citizenship. The DOJ attorneys have asked to talk about a different provision, which has not been halted by the courts, focused on sharing information.

As the </span><a href="https://cyberscoop.com/congress-letter-save-dhs-uscis-save-immigrant-voter-file/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Homeland Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seeks to transform a federal database for immigrant benefits into a database to search for noncitizen voters, a trio of Democratic senators are pressing the department for more information. Sens. Gary Peters, D-Michigan, Alex Padilla, D-Califronia, and Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon,</span><a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/25.07.15-Letter-to-Sec.-Noem-re-SAVE-Program_FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on July 15 posing a series of questions around the department’s overhaul of the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database. “States and nonpartisan voter advocacy organizations have expressed concerns with using the SAVE program as a standalone tool to determine voter eligibility without adequate safeguards,” the senators wrote. “In particular, there are concerns that data quality issues may cause state and local officials who rely on the program to receive false positives or incomplete results.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8881" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ColoradoIVotedWinner22-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Threat to Elections</strong>: William Wayne Bryant, 71, who once ran for sheriff in Archuleta County has been charged with arson for </span><a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/07/14/archuleta-county-election-equipment-molotov-cocktail-arrest/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allegedly throwing a Molotov cocktail into the Archuleta County Clerk’s office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to Colorado Public Radio, Bryant appears to have targeted the room where the county’s Dominion voting machines are stored. There are indications Bryant subscribes to conspiracy theories that Dominion equipment has been used to steal elections. The incident occurred in the early hours of June 12. According to the arrest affidavit, security video recorded a man throwing an incendiary device through a side window before running away. The bomb caused a fire that engulfed parts of the office. Soot, fire and water damage have forced the clerk&#8217;s office to remain closed since the incident.  Pagosa Springs police arrested Bryant on June 25 and charged him with 1st degree arson, a class 4 felony, and possession of an explosive or incendiary device, a class 5 felony. He is scheduled to be formally charged at a hearing on July 23, but that date could be extended, and is currently out on bail. According to the arrest affidavit, Bryant spoke publicly about wanting the county to get rid of its Dominion Voting machines. Archuleta County’s clerk and recorder, Republican Kristy Archuleta, said she’s familiar with Bryant because he ran for sheriff in 2022 as an unaffiliated candidate, getting 16 percent of the vote in a three-way race. The clerk believes Bryant has continued to stew over his loss.  “It&#8217;s kind of scary that it&#8217;s taken that long for him to do something like this,” Archuleta told CPR News. “We all have everyday frustrations. But how you react to them says a whole lot more about a person.” Archuleta said Dominion plans to send replacement machines once her staff moves into a more permanent location and reopens to the public; the equipment is covered by insurance.  “We just keep plugging along and doing our job exactly the way we&#8217;re supposed to. And it&#8217;s unfortunate that people think that we&#8217;re not doing the job according to law, but I mean, we all do. So it&#8217;s just frustrating that people think that,” said Archuleta. She added that she’s thankful no one was hurt in the attack. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Colorado, <em>The Denver Post</em> has a story about a </span><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/07/16/colorado-clerks-voting-machine-access-elections-donald-trump/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consultant claiming to work for the White House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called several Republican county clerks seeking “third-party” access to secure voting equipment. At least 10 Republican clerks were contacted by consultant Jeff Small, officials said. Small, who has Colorado political connections, told the clerks that he was working on the project for the White House and the U.S. departments of Justice and Homeland Security, and he said he wanted the clerks to let an outside party access voting equipment to identify “gaps.” All ten clerks denied the request.</span></p>

According to <em>Votebeat</em>, Philadelphia plans to use the new design in its November municipal elections. The state also consulted election officials from Berks, Greene, Butler, and Mercer counties. A mail ballot redesign in 2023 contributed to a 57% drop in mail-ballot rejections last year and Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt said he hopes to see similar results with the provisional redesign. With the mail-ballot envelopes, Schmidt was able to require that counties use the new design. But for the provisional-ballot envelopes, for now, it’s up to counties to choose whether to adopt the new design. Schmidt told <em>Votebeat</em> that as an incentive, the department is offering counties financial assistance to buy the new envelopes. </span></p>

The program took effect July 1 as part of the New Mexico Voting Rights Act signed into law in 2023. “This is a major step forward for voter access and election modernization in New Mexico,” Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said in a news release. “AVR makes voter registration faster, more accurate, and more secure.” Since implementation began July 1, 8,487 New Mexicans have been registered to vote or had their registration updated through the automatic system at MVD offices statewide, according to the Secretary of State’s Office. “By reducing paperwork and ensuring more eligible voters are on the rolls, we’re saving taxpayer money and making our democracy more accessible,” Toulouse Oliver said in the release. </span></p>

Hart Verity Vanguard 1.0 is the first system certified to these standards, but it will not be the last. The EAC staff has done great work to make this new standard a reality,” EAC Chairman Donald Palmer, Vice Chair Thomas Hicks, Commissioner Christy McCormick, and Commissioner Ben Hovland said in a joint statement.  Several steps remain before voters see this and other VVSG 2.0 certified systems at their voting location. State-level testing and certification, funding, procurement planning, staff training, and public testing are part of the process for jurisdictions to deploy new voting equipment. As this process moves forward, the EAC will continue to support election offices to ensure the systems in use at voting locations are secure and accurate. On February 10, 2021, the EAC Commissioners unanimously adopted the newest standard, VVSG 2.0, which was developed with a forward-looking approach that acknowledges the evolving landscape of election technology. The new guidelines are designed to meet the opportunities and challenges of future elections by incorporating updated cybersecurity protections, enhanced accessibility features, and support for more flexible system architectures. These updates improve the voter experience and further safeguard the integrity of the voting process, building on the solid foundation established by previous standards. The EAC now only accepts applications for voting system certification to VVSG 2.0. The only exception is for maintenance updates to systems already certified to VVSG 1.0. However, voting systems certified to VVSG 1.0 standards remain federally certified. These systems can continue to be used securely in accordance with state or local law as all EAC-certified voting systems remain secure, regardless of which VVSG they were certified to. </span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-11977" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-16-at-2.18.24 PM-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Trust in Elections</strong>: One unique aspect of America’s electoral system is its high degree of decentralization, whereby state and local governments retain primary responsibility for election policy and administration in their respective jurisdictions. As a result, differences that arise across the nation provide opportunities for states to learn from one another about the strengths and weaknesses of various election policies. To explore these differences and promote cross-state learning, </span><a href="https://www.rstreet.org/research/lessons-from-the-states-building-trust-in-american-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">R Street developed a series of policy studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on the unique blend of election policies in states across the country. Starting with three</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/2024-election/results/swing-states/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> swing states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have played pivotal roles in recent federal elections—Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania—these papers will offer practical lessons to help states continue refining their own election processes while guiding others in efforts to enhance accessibility, integrity, and public trust. Part I focuses on</span><a href="https://www.rstreet.org/research/lessons-from-the-states-building-trust-in-arizona-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Arizona</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and its lengthy experience implementing a citizenship verification requirement, heavy reliance on mail-in voting that sometimes introduces administrative challenges, and use of an open primary system that allows participation by the state’s large population of independent voters. Part II highlights</span><a href="https://www.rstreet.org/research/lessons-from-the-states-building-trust-in-georgia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a longstanding leader in election administration, including its best practices around voter list maintenance, voter ID, and election law training for law enforcement. At the same time, the state’s heavy reliance on electronic voting machines and runoff elections presents opportunities to strengthen its system further. Part III turns to Pennsylvania [coming soon], highlighting opportunities to streamline the state’s mail-in voting system, increase voter participation in the state’s primary elections, and build trust in the process through existing list maintenance procedures and stronger voter ID requirements. Together, these studies seek to provide policy insights that can help build trust in American elections.</span></p>

In our most recent analysis of young people’s voter participation in 2024, we found that youth turnout was 49% on average in states that make it easiest to participate through policies like automatic, same-day, and online voter registration. By contrast, in states that make it hardest to register and vote because they do not have such policies in place and/or have voter ID requirements, youth turnout was 44% on average. The landscape of voting policies is constantly changing, with new laws passed and policies implemented at the state level during every election cycle. Attempts to change voting policies at the federal level, like the SAVE Act which passed the House of Representatives in April 2025, have the potential to drastically alter the voter registration landscape across the country. Similar legislation at the state level may also present major challenges to engaging young voters. CIRCLE’s research—along with insights from other scholars and practitioners—suggests that by eliminating facilitative election policies and practices, and by introducing major new requirements like proof of citizenship, such legislation could have a substantial adverse effect on young people’s participation in our democracy.</span></p>

Since then, though, the pending question was whether the council would actually allocate the money to implement the initiative. Chairman Phil Mendelson voted against funding the initiative, siding with segments in the city’s Democratic Party that have opposed any changes to how residents vote. But on July 14 a majority of councilmembers sided with a push from At-Large Councilmember Christina Henderson and Ward 1 Councilmember Brianne Nadeau to fund the part of the initiative dealing with ranked-choice voting.  “It is the will of the voters,” Nadeau said. “We can advance something that will make a difference very soon in how we elect leaders in the city.” For his part, At-Large Councilmember Robert White said he wanted to support the will of the voters, and that ranked-choice voting can offer voters more and better choices. But he also asked that his colleagues keep in mind how ranked-choice voting plays out among different racial and economic groups, urging that a deep data dive happen after the first few election cycles. “I don’t think we should feel comfortable ignoring an equity issue,” he said. Ranked-choice voting is moving forward. It will now be left to the D.C. Board of Elections to implement it ahead of next June’s primary election, including rolling out a public education campaign for voters. “I believe we can move forward and work out the kinks,” Henderson said.</span></p>

The committee, tagged as a “blue ribbon” panel, aims to evaluate Georgia’s current election policies and provide recommendations for new election laws ahead of Georgia’s 2026 legislative session. It is chaired by state Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican, who recently became the first candidate to launch a bid for secretary of state. In his opening remarks, Fleming emphasized the need to restore public confidence in Georgia’s elections. “The legitimacy of our government — local, state and federal — rests squarely on the public’s trust in the electoral process,” he said. “That trust must be earned and maintained through transparency, consistency and integrity at every level, from the precincts in our neighborhoods to the local election superintendent’s offices and counties, to the Secretary of State’s office here in Atlanta.” During its six scheduled meetings, the committee plans to evaluate the role that the secretary of state’s office and the State Election Board play in overseeing elections across the state, Fleming added. </span></p>

A home rule petition is a formal request to the state legislature for authority to enact a law or regulation that is not already granted by general state law. Town Manager Matt Hanson said the process of drafting, authorizing, filing, and waiting for approval from the state legislature can take anywhere from six months to a year. Ranked choice voting was added to the STM warrant at the request of residents Madeleine Kando and Ethan Strominger, who volunteer with Bedford Ranked Choice Voting. The pair attended the June 30 Select Board meeting to inquire about adding such an article to the STM meeting warrant. The Select Board ultimately voted 3-1-1 to include an article on the Nov. 3 STM warrant asking residents if they would like to switch to a ranked choice voting method for local elections. </span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5218" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlabamaFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Alabama:</strong> Federal judges will weigh a request to</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/alabama-congressional-map-voting-rights-act-ab4a76126aaa072b7c6809084936f512"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bring Alabama back under the preclearance requirement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Voting Rights Act after ruling the state intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents when drawing congressional lines. Black voters and civil rights organizations, who successfully challenged Alabama’s congressional map, are asking a three-judge panel to require any new congressional maps drawn by state lawmakers to go through federal review before being implemented. The Alabama attorney general and the U.S. Department of Justice oppose the request. The three-judge panel in 2023 ordered the use of a new congressional map in Alabama. The judges selected the new map after saying they were “deeply troubled” that state lawmakers had ignored their directive to draw a second majority-Black district or something close to it. Plaintiffs said Alabama’s actions and the defiance of the court order mirror the state’s actions in the 1960s. “Alabama sought to ignore, evade, and strategically frustrate attempts to remedy racial discrimination,” lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote in a court filing. The request would require new congressional maps drawn through the 2030 Census cycle to undergo federal review by the court before being used. Plaintiffs argue that Alabama’s actions should trigger the so-called “bail-in” section of the Voting Rights Act that enables courts to retain jurisdiction and exercise preclearance power. “Preclearance flips the burden on the State to prove its innocence. That power is extraordinary,” Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall’s office wrote in a court filing opposing the request. The Justice Department is backing Alabama in asking the judges to reject the request. “Preclearance is permissible only when jurisdictions have engaged in pervasive, flagrant, widespread, and rampant discrimination,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in the filing signed by the acting chief of the voting section. Alabama’s actions did not rise to that level, they argued. Judges set a July 29 hearing on the request. </span></p>

The GOP terms the voters they are targeting as “never residents” because they are U.S. citizens but haven’t lived in the United States. Most frequently, they are children of U.S. citizens who have been in the military, or lived overseas for other reasons. Three-quarters of states have laws on the books allowing such citizens to vote by absentee or mail ballot in the same state where their parents or other relatives last lived or are registered. Arizona is one of these states, and allows such expatriates to vote in federal, state, and local elections. According to <em>Votebeat</em>, the lawsuit, filed June 30, claims that, because the state’s overseas and military voters are more Democratic than the voter roll as a whole, the law gives Democrats an unfair advantage. It asks the court to declare the law illegal and stop Arizona from registering any more voters who have never lived in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <em>Votebeat</em>, Cochise County wants an insurer to </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2025/07/11/cochise-county-supervisor-thomas-crosby-2022-election-legal-bills-insurance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cover $300,000 in legal bills </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a county supervisor charged with trying to delay certification of the 2022 midterm election results. A lawyer representing the county sent a letter July 11 to the Arizona Counties Insurance Pool, explaining that the county had received a demand from Supervisor Thomas Crosby, a Republican, that the county cover his legal costs in the case, which Crosby’s lawyer described as “a wrongful criminal prosecution.” By asking the government insurance pool to cover the costs on behalf of the county, the two other county supervisors, Republicans Frank Antenori and Kathleen Gomez, are signaling support for Crosby’s fight against the charges for his alleged actions, which occurred years before they took office. An outside lawyer representing the county, Michael J. Rusing of the firm Rusing Lopez &amp; Lizardi, wrote that it would be “appropriate” for the pool to cover the claim for Crosby’s legal bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <em>Courthouse News Service</em>, </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ninth-circuit-scrutinizes-new-arizona-election-guidelines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Ninth Circuit panel appears split on two provisions of Arizona’s elections procedures manual</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enjoined by a federal judge after conservative groups challenged them over potential voter suppression. Secretary of State Adrian Fontes last year updated the 2023 manual, published at the end of every odd year, to address two growing concerns. The first section challenged in federal court, known as the “canvass provision,” requires the secretary of state to throw out the votes of a county that refuses to canvass its votes by its deadline if the secretary has exhausted all other remedies. The second addition, called the speech provision, expands the list of what constitutes voter intimidation in Arizona, including &#8220;aggressive behavior, such as raising one’s voice or taunting a voter or poll worker,” and “using threatening, insulting, or offensive language to a voter or poll worker.” A federal judge enjoined both provisions before the 2024 general election. Defendants Fontes and Attorney General Kris Mayes appealed the order, arguing in Pasadena this week that the plaintiffs showed no likelihood of harm.  “The theory of injury is extraordinarily speculative,” Joshua Bendor told the panel, representing the attorney general’s office. He argued that the situation in Cochise County, in which two Republican supervisors tried to delay the canvass to instead platform election conspiracy theories, proved that voters have nothing to worry about because the secretary was able to enforce the canvass before reaching the point of voter disenfranchisement. </span></p>

Maxedon, 60, conspired with former postal worker Vicki Stuart to steal more than a dozen ballots from would-be voters before they could be delivered. Stuart was sentenced to 5 years in prison for her role in the case. Twenty-first Judicial District Attorney Dan Rubinstein said the discrepancies in the two plea agreements had to do with the difference in the role that each woman played, noting that the prosecution of Stuart was due in large part to cooperation from Maxedon. “Ms. Stuart was capable and, in fact, did follow through on doing all of this all alone and enlisted Ms. Maxedon’s help in doing part of it. But Ms. Maxedon could never have done any of this without Ms. Stuart,” Rubinstein said. “It was Ms. Stuart, as the mail carrier, who had access to the ballots, who specifically selected the names of the people, and that she seemed to be targeting people that she thought might be illegal or might possibly vote differently than she wanted the votes.” </span></p>

The groups working to get proposed amendments on the ballot say that means their work can move forward—at least for now. Walker’s ruling pauses part of a law banning people who aren’t U.S. or Florida residents from gathering petitions. In his ruling, Walker determined that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their challenges against the parts of the law he put on hold. The rest of the new law went into effect on July 1st. The state has maintained that the law is needed after they say the 2024 election season saw instances of fraud by petition gatherers. Walker rejected that argument, but let several parts of the new law stand. Those include a 90-day moratorium on supervisors of election processing the petitions and a rule that requires people who collect more than 25 petitions to register with the state.</span></p>

DeKalb Superior Court Chief Judge Shondeana Morris accepted GOP nominee Gail Lee, but rejected Bill Henderson’s nomination. Travis Bowden was then nominated and accepted. DeKalb County Republican Party Chairman Kendra Foltz Biegalski said she was pleased that Lee and Bowden were appointed. “Their dedication to fair and transparent elections strengthens our commitment to voter integrity,” she said. “We believe Bill Henderson’s technical expertise makes him an excellent candidate for future BRE roles and we hope future nominations allow more than 36 hours to ensure a thorough selection process.” The judge approved the nominations June 30. The board members will serve on the board from 2025-27. In a letter to DeKalb Elections Executive Director Keisha Smith dated June 26, Morris said she received more than 200 pieces of correspondence regarding the Republican nominees. She also reviewed some of Henderson’s public statements on his views of the elections board and election matters. “Having considered all those things, I do not believe that appointing Mr. Henderson to the Board would further the goals of ensuring that elections are credible and trustworthy in the eyes of the public,” Morris said.</span></p>

But the law shouldn’t be read that way, administrative law Judge Anna Hamburg-Gal found in an order this week that paves the way for official recognition of the union. City elections workers, including clerks, polling place investigators and equipment specialists, first sought union representation with the Service Employees International Union Local 73 nearly a year ago, saying they were frustrated by “stagnant” wages that didn’t keep pace with the cost of living in Chicago. But the board of election pushed back on the proposed bargaining unit of 80 to 90 workers. Attorneys for the board argued that because election workers are prohibited from engaging in “political activity” by the state’s election code, they should therefore be barred from joining SEIU. In legal filings, hired counsel for the board of election noted that SEIU 73 is politically active, lobbies legislatively and makes endorsements and financial contributions to political candidates. But in her order, Hamburg-Gal found that the state’s election code “need not be read as prohibiting unionization by (board of election) employees.” “An employee’s participation in a union does not necessarily equate to engagement in political activity,” she wrote. “Although the petitioner here engages in political activity, most of the Employer’s arguments would lose their force if the employees had sought representation by a newly formed labor organization that had committed not to become engaged in the political process.” The board of election has two weeks to appeal the order.</span></p>

Alex Titcomb, campaign manager for the ballot question committee “Voter ID for ME,” and four other registered voters challenged the wording for a citizen initiative to change various election laws, including the implementation of a photo ID requirement for voting. They argued that the language did not meet the statutory requirements of being understandable and not misleading to a reasonable voter, but the courts disagreed. The Dinner Table PAC launched the campaign in April 2024 as an effort to require voters to show photo identification at the polls. However, the official five-page petition submitted to the state in January seeks to change additional aspects of Maine election law, such as absentee voting.  Secretary of State Shenna Bellows called the petition “a wolf in sheep’s clothing” when it was first submitted to the state. When Bellows released the wording for the question that will appear on the November ballot, it encompassed the changes beyond photo ID requirements.  It will read: “Do you want to change Maine election laws to eliminate two days of absentee voting, prohibit requests for absentee ballots by phone or family members, end ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, ban prepaid postage on absentee ballot return envelopes, limit the number of drop boxes, require voters to show certain photo ID before voting, and make other changes to our elections?” The Superior Court affirmed the question’s wording, finding that it is understandable and not misleading.  Titcomb appealed the decision, arguing that the language used confusing terms and singled out the effect on seniors and people with disabilities.  The Maine Supreme Judicial Court then reviewed the case and upheld the Superior Court’s judgement.

According to documents filed by Special Prosecutor DJ Hilson, Lambert Junttila was “frequently” present in Oakland County hotel rooms and residences where individuals performed “testing” and/or experiments on the machines. While Lambert Junttila was initially set to go to trial in October 2024, the case has been repeatedly pushed back, with Judge Jeffery S. Matis telling the court room July 11 this case is the oldest on his docket.  Alongside her case in Oakland County, Lambert Junttila faces charges in Hillsdale County, where it’s alleged that she and former Adams Township Clerk Stephanie Scott permitted an unauthorized computer examiner to access voter data concerning the 2020 election, which included non-public information.</span></p>

Donahue, the high court reversed the previous decision of the Court of Appeals and kicked the case back to the Genesee County Circuit Court. Chief Justice Megan Cavanagh dissented but did not explain her reasoning for why she would deny leave to appeal. That left the court’s lone conservative, Justice Brian Zahra, to join the liberal majority of Justice Richard Bernstein, Justice Elizabeth Welch, Justice Kyra Harris Bolden and Justice Kimberly Thomas in remanding the case. The case centers around Republican contention that Flint violated state election law because it did not appoint “as nearly as possible” the same amount of election inspectors from each major party in the 2022 primary and general election. The Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the two political parties lacked standing to bring their claims against Flint City Clerk Davina Donahue, former Flint City Attorney William Kim and Flint City Assessor Stacie Kaake. </span></p>

The election boards say in the lawsuit that they are “obligated to ensure that all elections under their supervision meet legal requirements, protect military voters’ rights, and provide proper notice to all eligible voters.” On Tuesday, July 8, Jackson County Counselor Bryan Covinsky said White had the authority to veto the recall ordinance – even though it’s about him. As of late Tuesday afternoon, White still hasn’t signed or vetoed the recall election ordinance; therefore, Spino hasn’t certified the election for the JCEB and the KCEB to continue their normal election procedures.

Demarest Councilman David Jiang, a Democrat, finished third in a four-person race last month for two spots on the November ballot in the 39th Legislative District, which covers a northern swath of Bergen County. Jiang ran 137 votes behind former Woodcliff Lake Councilwoman Donna Abene. Conlon approved Jiang’s request to rerun machine vote totals but denied his push to hand review all ballots, meaning the review will be limited to in-person machine votes cast on or before election day. Mail ballots will be processed through tallying machines but won’t be subject to a hand review, said Michael Ash, who represented Jiang. “This recount … is vital in order to ensure that the voters of District 39 have properly had their votes counted, their votes exercised, and making sure that the right individual was elected to the seat,” Ash said during arguments this week.

The plaintiffs filed suit against North Dakota over a 2021 redistricting map they say diluted the power of Indigenous voters in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. North Dakota U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in 2023 concluded the map is discriminatory and ordered the state to adopt different district lines, but the 8th Circuit reversed his decision in May. The appellate court’s ruling found that private citizens have no means of filing lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act to challenge racially discriminatory voting practices. The 8th Circuit indicated it would send the case back to Welte and direct him to dismiss the lawsuit. The plaintiffs are getting ready to ask the Supreme Court to review the lawsuit. On July 15, they requested that the court allow Welte’s map to stay in place until a final decision in the case is reached. The plaintiffs said in court filings they could suffer lasting harm if the 2021 map is allowed to go back into effect.

The nonprofit Our Primary Voice and one of its members, Mark Porter, a resident of Clackamas County, filed the lawsuit on June 25 in Marion County Circuit Court against the state and the state’s top elections official, Secretary of State Tobias Read. In the lawsuit, Porter describes a fundamental conflict between the Oregon Constitution and state election laws. The constitution, Porter notes, lays out the requirements for voting: “A citizen is ‘entitled to vote in all elections’ if the citizen meets the three qualifications listed in [Article II, section 2(1) of the constitution]: age, residency, and registration,” the lawsuit says. “The Oregon Constitution does not list any other qualifications for a citizen to be entitled to vote in all elections.” In previous years, various groups have tried various ballot initiatives and measures to open Oregon’s primaries. But neither major party in Oregon has gotten behind the effort. Open-primary ballot measures failed in 2008 and 2014. A 2024 campaign failed to gather the number of signatures required to make the ballot.</span></p>

The lawsuit was filed by the Fulton County Board of Elections, current county commissioner Randy Bunch and former county commissioner Stuart Ulsh. In a ruling filed June 23, Chief Judge Michael A. Chagares and circuit judges Tamika Montgomery-Reeves and Theodore McKee upheld a ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The lower court’s ruling determined that the Board of Elections, Bunch, and Ulsh are not parties to an agreement between the county and Dominion Voting Systems and therefore lack standing to sue. The district court ruled that the county itself, which is a party to the agreement, is not a plaintiff in the suit. The court also ruled that, even if they did have standing, “they had failed to allege that the decertification of the voting system was attributable to Dominion rather than to the County itself.”</span></p>

Pennsylvania, home to approximately 1.4 million people registered as independent, unaffiliated, or members of a third party, is one of at least nine states that doesn’t allow independent voters to participate in primary elections. That means to cast a ballot in a party’s primary, a voter must be registered with that particular political party. “If we are successful, then the current statute will be declared unconstitutional, and therefore it will be non-functional, and that will mean immediately that independents can vote in party primaries,” said Shanin Specter, co-founding Partner, Kline &amp; Specter PC, the legal firm representing the group. “The legislature would be free to fashion other potential schemes with respect to voting, but such a scheme would have to protect the right of Independents to vote in primary elections, and…that’s the core of what we’re seeking,” Specter added. </span></p>

Hazelo was charged with two crimes over a dispute about the county auditor&#8217;s mask mandate in the election office while he tried to observe the ballot counting process last fall. The case went to trial last week. It took the jury about 2.5 hours to find Hazelo guilty of unauthorized access to a voting center, which is a felony, and criminal trespass, a gross misdemeanor. Hazelo had also been previously charged with disorderly conduct, but that charge was dismissed. This all stems from an incident on November 4, 2024, at the Island County Elections office, where Hazelo tried to observe the ballot counting process without a mask. Island County Auditor Sheilah Crider testified that she had imposed a mask mandate because nearly half her staff had previously gotten sick with COVID-19, and she couldn’t afford to have that happen again during an election. Crider also testified that they were concerned after dangerous substances like fentanyl had been found in ballots in other counties. In closing arguments, Island County Prosecuting Attorney Greg Banks argued the case isn’t about masks, but about following the rules that are set by the auditor for election observers.</span></p>

In 2023, Thornapple voted to stop using electronic voting machines, in favor of allowing only hand-marked ballots. They did without the machines for two elections in a row, in April and August 2024.The DOJ sued the town in September 2024, arguing that its decision violated the Help America Vote Act, which requires every “voting system” to be accessible for voters with disabilities. Accessible voting machines allow voters with disabilities to hear the options on the ballot and use a touch-sensitive device to mark it. The town argued that it wasn’t subject to the federal law’s accessibility provision because its use of paper ballots didn’t constitute a “voting system.” A district court judge rejected the town’s argument last September, and ordered it to use electronic voting machines for the November presidential election. The town appealed that order, but did use a machine in November. This week, the 7th Circuit panel affirmed the lower-court order, finding that “individuals with disabilities would lack the opportunity to vote privately and independently if they only had access to a paper ballot.” The court based that finding partially on Thornapple Chief Inspector Suzanne Pinnow’s testimony about a blind woman who relied on her daughter’s assistance to fill out a ballot, and a man who had a stroke and who needed Pinnow to guide his hand so he could mark a ballot.</span></p>
