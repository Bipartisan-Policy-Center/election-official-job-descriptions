							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election Official Turnover Rates through the 2024 Election</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joshua Ferrer, Daniel M. Thompson, Grace Klinefelter, Rachel Orey<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bipartisan Policy Center</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last spring, the Bipartisan Policy Center partnered with Joshua Ferrer and Daniel M. Thompson of the University of California, Los Angeles, to examine nationwide turnover rates of chief local election officials since 2000. The</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/election-official-turnover-rates-from-2000-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that turnover rose from 28% in 2004 to 39% in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now,</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/issue-brief/election-official-turnover-rates-through-the-2024-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a new update to the report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> examines turnover rates through 2024, which saw the highest rate of turnover yet: 41% of election officials administering the presidential election were different from those in charge of running the presidential election four years prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other key findings include:</span></p>
<p><strong>The turnover rate has been increasing steadily since 2000, but the 2024 data confirms that it is increasing faster since 2020.</strong></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13284" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BPCGraphic08.21.25.png" alt="" width="698" height="444" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BPCGraphic08.21.25.png 1022w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BPCGraphic08.21.25-300x191.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BPCGraphic08.21.25-768x488.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></p>
<p><strong>Increasing turnover means less time in a role. Despite less time in their role, many new election officials have prior experience in election administration.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024, 60% of chief local election officials had prior experience administering a presidential election, a decrease from 72% in 2004. Despite the decrease, a majority of local officials have experience administering high-turnout, high-visibility presidential elections. Sixty percent of new chief officials come into their job with prior experience in elections, and almost 80% have experience in government.</span></p>
<p><strong>A long-term increase in turnover is limited to small jurisdictions, while recent increases in turnover have been more pronounced in large jurisdictions.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority (93%) of jurisdictions have fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. Though the turnover rate in small jurisdictions is at an all-time high, it has been increasing steadily over the last quarter century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In large jurisdictions with more than 100,000 voting-age residents, on the other hand, turnover was consistent (about 35%) between 2000 and 2020 and saw a dramatic increase after 2020 to about 45%. Encouragingly, turnover in large jurisdictions decreased in 2024, from 46.1% in 2022 to 45.6% in 2024.</span></p>
<p><strong>Turnover is increasing nationwide, with state-by-state variations in turnover driven largely by the number of jurisdictions in a state.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turnover is increasing across the country, suggesting that the factors driving this trend are not state- or region-specific. The variation in turnover rate between states is largely caused by the number of jurisdictions in each state, which varies from three in Delaware to 1,851 in Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The widespread increase in turnover highlights the need for nationwide solutions to reduce turnover and improve retention of election administrators.</span></p>
<p><strong>Election administration is resilient, but action is needed to address increasing turnover.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election administrators have proven resilient even as turnover increases, continuing to administer elections accurately and efficiently despite high turnover and evolving challenges to their work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the 2024 data makes clear that turnover is still increasing nationwide. Election administration needs new policies and strategies to address both chronic and emerging causes of turnover and build the field’s long-term resilience.</span></p>

Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While much of the response was incredulity, not only about the idea of eliminating vote by mail and types of voting equipment, but the president’s power to actually do it, at least two secretaries of state– </span><a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/me/maine/news/2025/08/18/hoskins-trump-vote-by-mail"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missouri</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://wyofile.com/gray-wyoming-freedom-caucus-back-trump-plans-to-ban-mail-in-ballots-voting-machines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wyoming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – expressed their support for the idea. The president doubled down on Wednesday, once again taking to social media to call for the end of mail voting and for everyone to move to paper ballots–something</span><a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/verifier/#mode/navigate/map/voteEquip/mapType/ppEquip/year/2026"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> most jurisdictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already use. “Elections in the United States are run by the states as an intentional protection in our Constitution to prevent concentrated executive power,” said Verified Voting’s Pam Smith. “No president has the authority to dictate how Americans vote.</span><a href="https://tracking.us.nylas.com/l/9db5d7aeafff468d996dd92db6d88274/3/e10ed804dcd2559bbb445f461ff037943f64e6088a53dfbb9afa08dcb4c981aa?cache_buster=1755549924"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already vote with paper ballots.

Specifically, the Postal Service proposes to add Section 608.11, </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/12/2025-15266/postmarks-and-postal-possession"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Postmarks and Postal Possession.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This Section will serve multiple purposes. It will define the postmark, will identify the types of Postal Service markings that qualify as postmarks, and will describe the circumstances under which those markings are applied. This Section will also explain that, while the presence of a postmark on a mailpiece confirms that the Postal Service was in possession of the mailpiece on the date of the postmark&#8217;s inscription, the postmark date does not inherently or necessarily align with the date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of a mailpiece. In addition, this Section will advise customers of the options available if they want evidence of the exact date on which the Postal Service first accepted possession of their mailpiece. The proposed DMM addition does not signal and would not effect a change in postmarking procedures; postmarks will continue to be applied to Single-Piece First Class Mail pieces, both letter-shaped and flat-shaped, in the same manner and to the same extent as before.

The county’s “I Voted” Sticker Contest invited youth and adult artists to create sticker designs that celebrated voting and showcased the county’s unique natural environment. Adeline Pierce, a student at Sunny Brae Middle School, was named the youth winner and recognized for her winning design featuring a banana slug. “I love the forest and banana slugs,” said Pierce of her winning design. “When I was little me and my family would go on long walks through the forest. I adored banana slugs and would name them and build them slug houses, so of course I decided to do a banana slug design.” Carly Haynes, a local educator, was named the adult winner and said her design featuring an otter is meant to represent one of her favorite places in Humboldt County, the lagoons by Trinidad. “I also wanted to stay true to Humboldt’s weirdness which is why an alien spaceship is seen abducting an elk. I included ‘I Voted’ in Spanish, Hmong, Pashto and Vietnamese because these are some of the languages my students hear or speak at home. I wanted everyone in our community to feel included.” <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-13293" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/FairbanksNorthStarIVoted25-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />The winning youth and adult designs will be featured in vote-by-mail ballots through 2027. “Voting is both a right and a privilege, and this contest was a fun way to engage our community and encourage voting in Humboldt,” said Humboldt County Clerk-Recorder &amp; Registrar of Voters Juan Pablo Cervantes. “I’d like to thank everyone who shared their creativity, voted for their favorite designs and joined us at the Humboldt County Fair to celebrate the winners.” The </span><a href="https://www.newsminer.com/features/sundays/community_features/borough-announces-winners-of-2025-i-voted-sticker-contest/article_e87fcf65-4e8a-4085-9cde-19ee64688b0c.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">F Clerk’s Office recently announced the winners of the 2025 “I Voted” Sticker Contest: Aubrey Smith of Cyberlynx and Rhys Ott of Barnette Magnet!

							<h2>Ballot Measures, Legislation & Rulemaking</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5735" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Kenai-Peninsula-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska</strong>: Borough voters will decide this fall whether the borough should</span><a href="https://www.kdll.org/local-news/2025-08-15/ballot-prop-would-require-hand-counting-in-borough-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hand-count paper ballots in borough elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s after the borough clerk’s office signed off on a citizen initiative requesting the change. Waynette Coleman helped sponsor the petition, which builds on concerns she and others brought to the borough assembly last year. She says accurate voter roles, secure elections and confidence in the democratic process are important to her. “We the people have a right to vote and carry that vote honestly all the way through in an election, and that&#8217;s what we expect,” she told KDLL. Coleman says completely eliminating the use of technology in local elections, including tabulators, is necessary to restore confidence in elections. “That would mean we need to put it back to the precinct level, make it so that everybody that votes, there&#8217;s our peers there, there are people who may be hired, there are people that may be working for the state election, that&#8217;s fine, or for the local election, that&#8217;s fine, but it still would be within our neighborhood, our neighbors, our peers,” she said. Coleman envisions voters feeding ballots into a locked box until polls close. Then, election workers would hand-count ballots and relay the results to the borough. Michele Turner is the Kenai Peninsula Borough clerk. She’s been in touch with the Matanuska-Susitna Borough clerk, about what the changes could mean for the Kenai Peninsula. The Mat-Su Borough has hand-counted paper ballots since 2023. Turner says it’s hard to know how much a pivot to hand-counting would cost the borough, based on what she heard from the other clerk. “She still is yet trying to figure out the differences, other than the initial impact of them not paying for their software provider any longer,” she said. “She did share with me that there was additional costs for personnel with her staff as well, and needing more election workers.”</span></p>

The bill that unanimously advanced Tuesday, Aug. 19, by the House Election Integrity Committee would grant the attorney general the authority to punish the secretary of state in the event of a violation of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act (MCFA). The bill now awaits consideration on the House floor. Currently, the secretary of state investigates and resolves all violations of the MCFA. When the secretary of state or someone connected to them is accused of violating the law, the attorney general’s office investigates. However, as Attorney General Dana Nessel pointed out in a recent campaign finance violation case against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, the attorney general can’t issue punishments under the MCFA. At the time, Nessel’s office said lawmakers may want to consider fixing this issue.</span></p>

Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), would ban the voting method if signed into law. The measure passed 57-44 with nine members of the House not voting. Each vote affirming the passage of the bill came from a Republican member of the House, while each no vote came from the chamber’s Democrats. Eight Democrats and just one Republican – state Rep. Phill Green of Watertown Township – did not vote on the bill.</span></p>

According to Votebeat, the commission’s 5-1 vote came a month after it withheld a first set of proposed orders amid pushback from Madison and Dane County officials, and asked the city to propose its own remedies. Madison interim Clerk Mike Haas said the specificity of the commission’s original proposed orders “would set a troubling precedent.” The city did submit its proposals, but the commission rejected them as overly broad, and finalized orders that were largely similar to the ones it proposed in July, with some minor revisions, including citations of the legal basis for each order. The orders require Madison officials to create an internal plan detailing which election task is assigned to which employee; print pollbooks no earlier than the Tuesday before each election; develop a detailed record to track absentee ballots; and search through election materials for missing ballots before the city’s election canvassing board meets to finalize results.</span></p>

The two bills, which would require paper ballots be the default voting method in each county and would prohibit the use of ballot drop boxes, are in alignment with legislation that Secretary of State Chuck Gray backed earlier this year. During the meeting, Gray repeatedly referred to President Trump’s executive order “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections,” saying these bills are essential to achieving the president’s objectives. The bills also align with Gray’s “election integrity” agenda. Wyoming League of Women Voters President Linda Barton told the committee that they should heavily consider the input of the county clerks, and avoid supporting legislation that takes away local control for the sake of national agendas. “The bills before you today do not meet that standard,” Barton told the committee. “Instead, they erect barriers; impose costly, unfunded mandates; reduce access, and risk undermining public trust in our elections.” The committee also worked on two draft bills, one prohibiting “ballot harvesting” and one addressing voter registration procedures, which will be revisited during their November meeting.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3294" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Court-Ruling-1A-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Federal Litigation</strong>: The conservative network Newsmax will </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/dominion-voting-newsmax-defamation-trump-2020-3b2366dfdae3a8432afe822bf14fe1ef"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay $67 million to settle a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accusing it of defaming Dominion Voting Systems  by spreading lies about President Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss, according to documents filed this week. The settlement comes after Fox News Channel paid $787.5 million to settle a similar lawsuit in 2023 and Newsmax paid what court papers describe as $40 million to settle a libel lawsuit from a different voting machine manufacturer, Smartmatic, which also was a target of pro-Trump conspiracy theories on the network. Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis had ruled earlier that Newsmax did indeed defame Denver-based Dominion by airing false information about the company and its equipment. But Davis left it to a jury to eventually decide whether that was done with malice, and, if so, how much Dominion deserved from Newsmax in damages. Newsmax and Dominion reached the settlement before the trial could take place. The settlement was disclosed by Newsmax in a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It said the deal was reached August 15. </span></p>

According to Votebeat, her opinion marks a turning point in the debate among officials over how to handle the eligibility of the roughly 200,000 voters, who were erroneously listed in state records as having provided proof of U.S. citizenship even though they hadn’t been asked to. Arizona requires such proof to vote in state and local elections, and counties have been sending notices to voters to try to collect the information. Mayes said county recorders cannot legally suspend these voters’ registrations or make them eligible only for federal elections if they now fail to respond to these notices. “If an Affected Voter responds by providing such evidence, that should dispel doubt,” Mayes wrote. “But if an Affected Voter does not respond, the mere lack of response does not, under current law, authorize the county recorder to cancel the voter’s registration, in whole or in part.” It’s unclear whether county recorders will follow Mayes’ opinion, which is meant to advise officials but does not have the force of law, according to the Attorney General manual, Votebeat reported. </span></p>

Peters is serving a nine-year prison sentence for her role in a breach of Mesa County’s elections systems during a 2021 software update. She was convicted by a jury in August 2024 on four felony counts related to the security breach, which was part of an effort to demonstrate that the 2020 election was untrustworthy, even though there is no credible evidence to support that position. Peters has appealed the conviction, and while the Colorado Court of Appeals reviews her appeal, her legal team filed a federal habeas corpus petition. The petition, which was filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, argues that Peters should be released on bond pending the appeal decision. The filing by the attorney general’s office cites the 1971 U.S. Supreme Court case Younger v. Harris, in which the court recognized “longstanding public policy against federal court interference with state court proceedings.” According to the filing, if three conditions in the case are met, then the federal court “must abstain from exercising jurisdiction regarding state proceedings.” Those conditions are that the state proceedings are ongoing; the state proceedings implicate important state interests; and the state proceedings afford an adequate opportunity to present the federal constitutional challenges. The filing argues that those conditions are met, because Peters’ state-level appeal is ongoing, her conviction is criminal, thus an important state interest, and her appeal allows her to present her constitutional challenge. Based on the precedent set in the Younger case, the filing says the federal court does not have jurisdiction in Peters’ habeas corpus petition.</span></p>

The state filed a notice that is a first step in asking the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the Aug. 8 ruling by U.S. District Judge Mark Walker. The notice, as is common, did not detail the state’s arguments. But Walker’s ruling said part of the 2023 law that seeks to prevent non-U.S. citizens from collecting voter-registration applications violates equal-protection rights. Under the law, voter-registration groups could face a $50,000 fine for each non-citizen collecting or handling applications. Walker in 2023 issued a preliminary injunction against the non-citizen restriction. In his Aug. 8 ruling, Walker issued a final order and a permanent injunction against enforcing the law against two plaintiffs in the case, the civil rights group UnidosUS and Humberto Orjuela Prieto, who lives in Osceola County and is a legal permanent resident from Colombia.</span></p>

Their decision upholds a lower court ruling that found the boundaries discriminated against Black voters.  The panel’s ruling was issued August 14 in the case Nairne v. Landry, in which Black voters sued the state over redistricting plans the legislature adopted in 2022. The new boundaries for Louisiana Senate and House of Representatives districts did not increase the number of majority Black seats. The plaintiffs alleged they were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.  The three appellate judges – James Dennis, an appointee of President Bill Clinton; Catharina Haynes, an appointee of President George W. Bush; and Irma Ramirez, an appointee of President Joe Biden – upheld a 2024 ruling from U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick of the Middle District of Louisiana. Dick determined the legislative maps do not give Black voters a fair opportunity to elect their own representatives. Dick’s ruling came after the 2023 elections, when a new class of lawmakers were elected, yielding a Republican supermajority in both chambers.  The state appealed Dick’s decision, arguing in part that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional and should not be applied to Louisiana. The section prohibits actions and policy that restrict a person’s right to vote based on their race, color or membership in a language minority group. The 5th Circuit judges disagreed with that argument. </span></p>

Aycock ruled the map, which was enacted in 1987, violates the Voting Rights Act and cannot be used in future elections. The Mississippi branch of the American Civil Liberties Union helped litigate the lawsuit, arguing the map cut Mississippi&#8217;s Delta region — a historically Black area — in half. The lawsuit, which was filed on April 25, 2022, argued the map diminished the Black vote in the Central District. Aycock&#8217;s ruling notes that only four Black people have served on the Mississippi Supreme Court. All of them held the same seat in the Central District and were first appointed to the position by a sitting governor. Aycock wrote that she will impose a deadline for the Mississippi Legislature to create a new map.</span></p>

The plaintiffs want the U.S. District Court’s Great Falls Division to find Chouteau County’s at-large elections for its three commissioners don’t comply with the Voting Rights Act. They also want the court to implement a redistricting plan that doesn’t dilute the Native American vote. The complaint requests the court order a plan “that provides at least one Native American voting-age majority single-member commissioner district that effectively performs for the Native American candidate of choice.”</span></p>

The trial court said the group didn’t show its members had been harmed, but the appellate court ruled that they were likely to face harm because many counties had already started the process leading to the use of the ExpressVote XL machines.</span></p>

George Hawkins, convicted as a minor of attempted murder and aggravated malicious wounding in 2010, challenged the system after Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin declined to restore his voting rights in 2023. Hawkins argued that Virginia&#8217;s one-of-a-kind system, whereby the governor has unbridled authority to restore felons&#8217; voting rights, violates a constitutional principle prohibiting administrators from exercising unfettered discretion over whether to grant licenses that implicate an individual&#8217;s First Amendment rights. A three-judge panel agreed with a lower court&#8217;s ruling that the voting restoration process differs from a licensing scheme.  &#8220;Hawkins&#8217; claim fails because, as both other federal courts of appeal to consider this question have concluded, the discretionary exercise of Virginia&#8217;s clemency power does not constitute a licensing system,&#8221; U.S. Circuit Judge Andrew Wynn said.  Wynn relied on the Sixth Circuit&#8217;s decision in Lostutter v. Kentucky, where the federal court rejected a similar challenge. The Sixth Circuit outlined the differences between pardons and administrative licensing, including that pardons are retrospective and one-time acts rather than ongoing. The key difference, however, is that pardons restore a right once held but lost due to illegal conduct, while licenses regulate how a person exercises a right they already possess. </span></p>

Last September, ahead of the 2024 general election, Wausau Mayor Doug Diny put on work gloves, donned a hard hat and used a dolly to cart away a drop box outside City Hall, posing for pictures as he did so. Diny, a conservative candidate backed by the Republican Party, ran for office on his opposition to absentee ballot drop boxes. He insisted he did nothing wrong by removing the box, but eventually turned it back over to the clerk, who then had the box re-installed and bolted to the ground. The box was locked and no ballots were inside it when the mayor wheeled it away. Criminal investigators with the Wisconsin Department of Justice took the lead in an investigation into the incident. Marathon County District Attorney Kyle Mayo requested a special prosecutor be appointed to the case to ensure full transparency and impartiality. As special prosecutor, Toney will review the DCI&#8217;s investigation, determine whether additional investigation is needed and make any appropriate determinations related to the investigation.</span></p>

Westby</span><a href="http://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/politics-government/2025-08-18/wyoming-judge-dismisses-attempt-to-remove-secretary-gray-from-office"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dismissed an attempt to remove</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secretary of State Chuck Gray from office on Aug. 11. Retired Laramie attorney Tim Newcomb filed the lawsuit in Albany County’s Second Judicial District in February. Newcomb looked to have Gray removed under Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment, which bans state officials from having engaged in insurrection or rebellion. Newcomb’s lawsuit alleged Gray provided “aid and comfort” to Jan. 6 insurrectionists who rioted at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. In her decision to dismiss the case Westby said that Newcomb failed to include facts about Gray’s involvement and also lacked standing to sue. “The Plaintiff is attempting to impeach the Secretary through a declaratory judgement action,” wrote Westby. “The impeachment process does not allow a private citizen to bring such a case, nor does it allow for court involvement other than the Chief Justice presiding over the trial of a governor in the Senate.”</span></p>
