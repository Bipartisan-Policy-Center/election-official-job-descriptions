														<p><strong>Voter Registration Database Security </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Successes, Challenges, and Areas for Improvement</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Kira Flemke, April Tan, and Kyle Upchurch<br />
</span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voter registration databases (VRDBs) are a critical piece of election infrastructure that store centralized state voter registration lists. They perform a range of important functions, including verifying voter eligibility. Election officials have worked hard in recent years to strengthen VRDB security to ensure elections are secure and successful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the demands of election security continue to evolve. And looking ahead, some officials and experts are concerned that the federal government has stopped providing assistance that was instrumental to securing past elections. To track developments in VRDB security, the Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR) has surveyed states about VRDB security every two years since 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEIR</span><a href="http://electioninnovation.org/research/2024-vrdb-security-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently released its 2024 voter registration database security report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The research highlights important trends to help election officials and policymakers navigate the complexities of VRDB security, such as reduced federal resources, new threats, and aging systems. The report discusses the federal resource landscape, best practices over time, and 2024 security survey results. These insights are supplemented with insights from additional state interviews highlighting their security practices and partnerships.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election officials have reported concern that crucial federal resources for VRDB security will almost certainly be unavailable.</strong> These resources include cybersecurity training, network monitoring, and security coordination and information sharing. Since the current administration has cut funding and capacity for election security, officials and policymakers need clarity and solutions. Some officials are looking to state resources and other partnerships to fill potential gaps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Washington works closely with their national guard on election cybersecurity issues and has robust in-house security support through their Information Security and Response Division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Most states have adopted best practices across five key areas, according to CEIR’s analysis of the most recent survey responses from all 40 states that have participated since 2018.</strong> These areas are: 1) backing up VRDBs, 2) conducting system audits, 3) participating in tabletop exercises for cybersecurity training, 4) using a network monitoring system, and 5) requiring multi-factor authentication for access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The 2024 VRDB security survey showed widespread best practices, with some specific areas for improvement.</strong> The report adapts the NIST 2.0 Cybersecurity Framework to organize findings into four security dimensions: Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The table below summarizes widely used best practices and areas for improvement. Best practices across these dimensions include comprehensive user training, VRDB access restrictions, monitoring networks, and securely backing up VRDBs. Areas for improvement include diversifying resources beyond those provided by the federal government and improving communication with third-party vendors that oversee security services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are limitations to what this report can say definitively about the state of VRDB security across the country, this research remains the most comprehensive attempt to analyze states’ VRDB security. CEIR will continue its research in this critical field to help inform officials and policymakers and support states in meeting new challenges.</span></p>

But Schwab did not provide the full data the Justice Department wanted. Instead, the second-term state secretary of state and candidate for governor wrote that he was “initially” giving its lawyers only publicly available voter information. Sens. Mark Warner (D-Virginia) and Alex Padilla (D- California), the top Democrats on Senate’s intelligence and rules committees, asked </span><a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2025/09/senators-call-election-security-briefing-major-races-draw-closer/408125/?oref=ng-homepage-river"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director of National Intelligence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tulsi Gabbard  in a letter to schedule a briefing with senators by Oct. 10 to provide an assessment of planned steps the intelligence community is taking to protect the security of upcoming elections in November, as well as next year’s midterms. They also asked Gabbard to clarify statements she’s made since taking office that appear to call into question the security of voting machines in the U.S. Those statements are “harmful and unsubstantiated,” the lawmakers wrote. Independent groups test voting platforms for vulnerabilities ahead of major elections, and past reviews show that claims about their poor technical controls stem largely from false narratives spread by foreign adversaries. According to Democracy Docket, after federal courts told President Donald Trump he couldn’t directly order the </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/right-wing-groups-press-election-agency-on-proof-citizenship-rule-for-voter-registration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Election Administration Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EAC) to require documentary proof of citizenship on its voter registration forms, America First Legal (AFL), a right-wing legal group founded by Stephen Miller, petitioned the independent agency to do it anyway.  And now, roughly halfway through the public comment period on that proposal, almost all of the more than 1,000 submissions urge the commission to adopt the proof of citizenship requirement. The comments appear to have been mobilized by a handful of groups. AFL’s petition, filed in July, asks the EAC to add the proof of citizenship requirement to the national mail voter registration form, the standard application for federal election registration. The EAC opened the petition for public comment August 21 and it will close October 20. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13423" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/InternationalMail-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Military &amp; Overseas News:</strong> The Washington Post has a report this week, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/16/tariffs-trump-foreign-mail-expats/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that tariffs imposed by the U.S. have caused postal traffic to the U.S. from foreign countries to plunge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the paper, the Trump Administration decided to cancel a policy — known as the de minimis exemption — that allowed the tariff-free flow of goods under $800 into the United States. The move has led dozens of countries to halt or slow shipments to the U.S. as they determine how to calculate and collect duties. Caught up in the gridlock: mailed envelopes. The tariffs do not apply to letters and gifts worth less than $100 from individuals. But confusion about the rules has led to issues since the exemption was lifted on Aug. 29. At first, national postal services in more than 30 countries temporarily suspended sending some or most U.S.-bound packages. Since then, restrictions have eased, and the Universal Postal Union recently deployed a tool to help operators calculate duties and resume services. White House spokesman Kush Desai told the paper the U.S. Postal Service and Customs and Border Protection were working with foreign postal operators to comply with the new requirements. Kate Muth, executive director of the International Mailers Advisory Group, said people in countries where mail is suspended may need to turn to more expensive services to ensure that their mailings reach their intended destinations with fewer delays and disruptions.Grace Coston, a Virginia voter and freelance interpreter working in France, shelled out the 65 euros for such a service when she needed to vote in this month’s special election in Virginia’s 11th District. Coston, 67, had tried submitting her ballot envelope to the automated machine at her local post office near Paris, but it told her that no U.S.-bound packages would be accepted. The office staff told her that they didn’t want to accept her mailing because they weren’t sure it would reach its destination.</span></p>

He was 57. According to Yellowhammer News, Packard was the first person in the United States to earn a Master of Public Administration degree with a specialty in election administration in 1996 through Auburn University. Packard’s career in election administration began at Auburn (1992-1996) where he was lead coordinator for implementing election programs through contracts with the Alabama Secretary of State’s office. From Spring 1996 to Spring 1997, he worked for the State Board of Elections in Raleigh, North Carolina as an education and training specialist. Then it was back to Alabama. In 1997, he was appointed Administrator of Elections with the Alabama Secretary of State’s office. In 2007, he was appointed Supervisor of Voter Registration and oversaw statewide voter registration programs. Packard was a candidate in the 2006 Alabama Democratic primary for the office of Secretary of State. He was defeated by incumbent Secretary of State Nancy Worley, who then lost the general election to State Auditor Beth Chapman. In March 2013, Packard was named State Election Director in the office of the Alabama Secretary of State. In 2017, Packard was moved to the elections division of the Secretary and finished out his career there in December 2021. “Ed Packard was a hard-working state employee for two and a half decades. He was both a student and teacher of elections and voter registration issues. He gave the kind of customer service in that office that is so rare today in the business world, returning every call and getting to the bottom of every issue,” Chapman said in a statement. </span></p>

To map out the range of actors engaged in the work, identify emerging focus areas for further growth, and evaluate the ecosystem’s needs, Bridging Divides Initiative undertook a collaborative research process to better understand the state of community safety and de-escalation in the U.S.  Drawing on interviews with more than 30 practitioners conducted during the first quarter of 2025, this </span><a href="https://bridgingdivides.princeton.edu/discussion-paper-understanding-how-community-safety-and-de-escalation-ecosystem-responding"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new discussion paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finds that community safety and de-escalation approaches to countering political violence are a fast-evolving specialization within the peacebuilding field. The wide variety of practitioners, coupled with rising demand fueled by the elevated risk environment, have led to both challenges and opportunities for cross-sector collaboration. Civil society, philanthropy, and other stakeholders have an important role to play in supporting the ecosystem to navigate these challenges, capitalize on these opportunities, and sustainably build capacity at a time of rapidly increasing need.</span></p>

Co-chaired by former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh C. Johnson and retired federal appellate Judge J. Michael Luttig, the task force assembled distinguished leaders from across the legal, business, academic and civic sectors. The report calls for immediate and sustained action to bolster public confidence in American democracy, including major reforms to elections, civics education and the role of lawyers in defending constitutional governance. Drawing on two years of hearings, listening tours and research, the report advances reforms in 12 core areas, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civics Education: Substantially increase federal and state investment in K–12 civics, adopt enhanced instructional requirements and support the bipartisan Civics Secures Democracy Act to create “a more informed and engaged electorate.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redistricting: Establish independent, citizen-led redistricting commissions to eliminate partisan gerrymandering and ensure voters choose their representatives.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Processes: Encourage states to adopt open primaries, ranked-choice voting and/or fusion voting to reduce polarization and improve accountability.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Administration: Depoliticize the selection of election officials and establish professional standards and codes of responsibility.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Worker Safety: Provide federal funding and stronger state protections to ensure the safety of election workers and deter threats and interference.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Access: Expand automatic and same-day registration, standardize early and mail voting procedures and support the Election Day Holiday Act to increase participation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Security: Mandate hand-marked paper ballots or paper audit trails and require robust post-election audits to safeguard integrity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combatting Disinformation: Support laws like the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act to address political deepfakes and require disclosure of AI-generated content.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Role of Lawyers: Affirm lawyers’ obligations to the rule of law, expand CLE programs and create accessible, credible election law resources.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frivolous Litigation: Require three-judge panels and expedited appeals for election challenges.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law School Training: Implement curricula that prepare future lawyers to uphold democracy and the rule of law, as pledged by over 120 law school deans.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civil Discourse: Promote initiatives like “Disagree Better” to model respectful debate and reduce polarization.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force’s work included a national listening tour in key states, partnerships with secretaries of state, law schools and bar associations and mass mobilization efforts such as the reaffirmation of lawyers’ oaths on Law Day, May 1, 2025.

These guides are designed to help local organizers and community leaders across the country navigate new laws and regulations as they continue to bridge the voter registration gap in the run-up to the 2026 midterms. The voter registration drive guides, covering 49 states and Washington, D.C. (North Dakota doesn’t require voter registration), provide a comprehensive and trusted resource for nonprofit leaders, campus organizers, community outreach groups, and others seeking to understand and comply with state-specific voter registration rules. They are compiled by election law experts in Fair Elections Center’s Voting Rights Project.  “We believe that democracy works best when all voices are heard at the ballot box,” said Michelle Kanter Cohen, Policy Director and Senior Counsel with Fair Elections Center’s Voting Rights Project. “Helping eligible citizens register to vote should not be a contentious issue. Empowering people and communities to make their voices heard is something we should all be working towards for the greater long-term health of our republic. This isn&#8217;t about partisanship—it&#8217;s about participation.” Armed with up-to-date registration information, nonprofits help cut confusion, remove barriers, and drive turnout — especially in underserved communities.

Whether they’re engaged in digital outreach, programming, or field-based voter drives, nonprofits can use these fact sheets to train staff, inform strategy, and ensure every touchpoint—from texts to town halls—is rooted in accurate, accessible civic guidance.” Access state voter registration drive guides</span><a href="https://newheightscommunications-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2bR7iUtUi3yHI4ZjBKtnmjquxaYKuGYfmY10_lCU45Z8iqftNmQEIwUoEFxFARPpedo-YoGGc6eMrCbJMe4oCf5e4DwSTeK2CaNGSnURXcY-hs-S-K-QBLk4eiXunXfa_1HCok980S23nGATtXU6c9_sTSiyhwrqVgmgg8-zbtKP5FSLT_3mIBfKi1JVLbVKK2J_lsJTfJsE2uaygw6Fnm9vAlPbU"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>

							<h2>Ballot Measures, Legislation & Rulemaking</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-12049" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-30-at-6.08.05 AM-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Alaska Ballot Measure</strong>: A group of Alaska Republicans has filed a ballot initiative </span><a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2025/09/11/ballot-initiative-organizers-want-to-ban-noncitizen-voting-in-alaska-its-already-prohibited/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking to clarify a requirement that only U.S. citizens be allowed to vote in Alaska elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Already, Alaska statute states that to vote in Alaska, a person must be a U.S. citizen. Reports from the Division of Elections indicate that noncitizen voting is exceedingly rare. The</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26089850-25uscv-the-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ballot initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would amend the statute to add a single word: “only.” Existing law states that “A person may vote at any election who … is a citizen of the United States.” The petition seeks to amend the statute to dictate that “Only a person who … is a citizen of the United States … may vote at any election.” The initiative sponsors, former Senate Majority Leader John Coghill of Fairbanks, former House Speaker Mike Chenault of Kenai and former Anchorage Sen. Josh Revak, say the change is needed. “With things that are going on in the world today, we need to make explicitly clear what our intentions are and what the people in the State of Alaska would like to see,” Chenault said in a brief interview. “That’s why we put forth this initiative.” The initiative proposed by Coghill, Chenault and Revak would not amend the Alaska Constitution. Passing a ballot measure in Alaska requires gathering thousands of signatures from voters across the state to place the question on a statewide ballot. If the organizers succeed in gathering the requisite signatures, a ballot measure is typically accompanied by a statewide campaign to garner support from voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-8836" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ShastaCoCA-150x150.png" alt="" width="84" height="84" />Shasta County, California Ballot Measure</strong>: The Shasta Election Task Force said they have submitted more than 10,000 signatures to the County Clerk and Registrar of Voters Office in an </span><a href="https://krcrtv.com/news/northstate-divide/shasta-group-submits-10000-signatures-in-bid-to-change-county-voting-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;">effort to place a measure on the ballot that would alter the voting process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The group delivered three boxes of petitions on Tuesday morning, initiating the process for staff to verify the signatures. The proposed amendments include implementing voter ID requirements, ensuring same-day election results, and maintaining clean voter rolls. The group aims to have the measure on the ballot by next June, or sooner if possible, contingent upon the validation of the signatures. When asked about the legality of their proposals in relation to state law, the group expressed confidence that their measures are legal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6763" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MICap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Michigan:</strong> A bill reintroduced by Sen. Mary Cavanagh, a Democrat from Redford Township, would </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/michigan/2025/09/11/senate-bills-lying-elections-signature-gathering/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">impose a $1,000 fine on anyone who knowingly lies about elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or a voter’s eligibility. Employers who had someone working for them “for election-related purposes” violate the provision — such as a lobbyist who suggests certain groups aren’t eligible to vote early — could face a fine of up to $10,000. The goal is to deter election-related misinformation in a critical swing state, Cavanagh said during a Senate Elections and Ethics Committee hearing Wednesday. Such efforts “can cause confusion, reduce voter turnout, and ultimately undermine the legitimacy of our electoral system,” she said. Cavanagh’s proposal would target only those who “maliciously” spread false information, she said. “We worked very closely with the ACLU as well as the Secretary of State’s office, the AG and municipal government to make sure we’re not infringing on anyone’s rights or someone just passing information to their neighbor,” Cavanagh said.</span></p>

House Speaker Jason White has tasked the bipartisan panel — one of four select committees he formed to tackle complex issues before the next legislative session — to hold public hearings on the issues and craft legislation. “Once again, the House’s legislative priorities will be clear and informed from the start as we maintain our focus and energy on preparing for the 2026 legislative session,” he wrote recently of the select committees. The Committee heard from Samantha Buckley, director of policy for the Secure Democracy Foundation. Her presentation made clear that Mississippi is far behind the curve on dealing with these three voting rights issues.</span></p>

Youngkin’s order also calls for stronger cybersecurity protocols, regular system testing, and closer coordination with state and local election officials. The governor’s office said the move is part of a broader effort to give Virginians more confidence in the fairness and accuracy of local, state, and federal elections. The order tasks election officials with ensuring that voter data is shared securely and that ineligible voters are removed from the rolls through the expanded use of the Department of Homeland Security’s SAVE database. It also requires the Virginia Fusion Center and Department of Emergency Management to conduct a statewide election preparedness exercise before early voting in a race begins to test coordination, response plans, and communication across agencies.</span></p>

This time, the proposal is tied to measures conservatives want, including regulations for ballot drop boxes and an explicit ban on clerks fixing, or curing, errors on ballots. By bundling the measures together, GOP leaders hope to finally unite their party on a plan that would shorten the wait for election results, reduce the opportunity for election misinformation, and avoid a veto by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The proposal, which Votebeat obtained in draft form from Republican Rep. Scott Krug, is set to be publicly released next week. Krug, former chair of the Assembly Elections Committee and now assistant majority leader in the Assembly, said he “will use every little ounce of political capital effort I created on elections to get Monday processing done, because that’s 90% of our problem in the state: perception.”</span></p>

The government sought to tie federal funds under the Help America Vote Act — a 2002 law aimed at making voting more inclusive, accessible and efficient — to the states’ compliance with the changes. This gives the states standing to sue, Casper said. “This potential loss of federal funding is an imminently threatened economic injury sufficient to confer standing,” the Barack Obama appointee wrote, rejecting the government’s motion to dismiss. A coalition of 19 states filed the lawsuit in Massachusetts federal court in April. They challenged an executive order from President Donald Trump that announced the new requirements, which the states say exceed the powers of the president and would disenfranchise lawful voters around the country. In her ruling, Casper didn’t make any determination on the lawfulness of the executive order, rather only if the states had the right to challenge it in court. The government argued that the states lack the ability to do so because it has yet to take any actions to enforce the new rules. The judge disagreed, citing case law from a 2007 patent case that found “where threatened government action is concerned, a plaintiff is not required to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threat.” “The … states have alleged an injury sufficient to support standing and ripeness to challenge,” Casper wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5218" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlabamaFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Alabama:</strong> A panel of judges at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/11th-circuit-skeptical-of-alabama-ban-on-paid-election-assistance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heard oral arguments this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a case over the validity of an Alabama law banning voters from receiving assistance obtaining absentee ballot applications. The dispute centers on Alabama Senate Bill 1, enacted in 2024 amid national debates on election integrity. The law bans third-party submission of absentee ballot applications except by family, household members or caregivers, and prohibits payments or gifts for assisting with applications.  However, a lower court blocked the law in September 2024 after a group of nonprofits, including the NAACP&#8217;s Alabama conference, League of Women Voters chapters, Greater Birmingham Ministries and Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program, sued in April 2024. Chief U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor, an appointee of George W. Bush determined that SB1’s submission and payment provisions likely violate the Voting Rights Act. Proponents of SB1 frame it as a bulwark against “ballot harvesting” fraud. As Alabama’s brief states, the law targets “election fraud, absentee voting and vulnerable voters,” citing historical risks like unauthorized collections that could coerce or manipulate ballots. The three-judge panel pressed Bowdre about the potential for severe criminal penalties — up to 20 years in prison and $30,000 in fines — for assistants who receive any payment while helping voters. U.S. Circuit Judge Robin Rosenbaum raised a specific concern about how the law might criminalize routine assistance, such as a paid health care worker helping a disabled person fill out an absentee ballot application.  U.S. Circuit Judge Andrew Lynn Brasher also explored the criminal penalty issue, asking whether the law&#8217;s restrictions on economic transactions for voter assistance might be constitutionally problematic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lawsuit filed by a Decatur resident claiming that ballots were missing candidate names in at least two precincts has been </span><a href="https://www.rocketcitynow.com/article/news/local/lawsuit-over-decatur-mayoral-candidates-municipal-ballots-dismissed/525-70211176-f746-4ac1-8522-32c230af5376"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Morgan County Circuit Court. The suit &#8212; which sought an injunction that would put a hold on certification &#8212; was dismissed with prejudice, meaning that it can&#8217;t be refiled. The court said that the person who brought the suit, Maurice Ayers, failed to meet requirements to proceed, including missing the deadline to contest an election, naming the election winner as a defendant as required by state law, failed to pay a security fee, and did not provide verification for all of the claims presented. While the court recognized that the Ayers &#8220;demonstrated that certain witnesses may have received ballots without all the candidates&#8217; names, the Plaintiff has failed to set out, by logic or evidence, that the outcome of the election would have been altered in any way,&#8221; and, &#8220;failed to demonstrate he or any other person will suffer irreparable harm without an injunction.&#8221; In the second count in the suit, a Petition for a Recount, the court stated that it has no jurisdiction to &#8220;order or preside over a recount under the circumstances alleged.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both </span><a href="https://mynbc15.com/news/local/both-challenges-to-prichard-mayoral-election-results-denied-by-mobile-co-circuit-judge"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenges to the election results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Prichard mayoral race have been denied by Mobile County Circuit Judge Michael Youngpeter. Citing the fact that “neither complainant even attempted to file security for costs”, Youngpeter dismissed both lawsuits because the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The dismissal means that the uncounted provisional ballots that were turned in late by the Prichard City Clerk to the Board of Registrars, as many as 32, will remain uncounted. Martin had closed to within three votes of Jimmie Gardner for runner-up in the Mayoral race after 4 provisional ballots were counted at the canvassing one week after the election. Carletta Davis received the most votes and will now face incumbent Jimmie Gardner in the runoff election on September 23rd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Arizona:</strong> The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled this week that Secretary of State Adrian Fontes</span><a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2025/09/16/9th-circuit-court-rules-fontes-cannot-enforce-ban-on-offensive-speech-or-conduct-at-polling-places/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cannot enforce his ban on offensive or insulting speech at or around polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The court concluded that the provisions Fontes included in the Elections Procedures manual are so broad that they could criminalize unintentional conduct. Judge Kim Wardlaw, writing for the unanimous three-judge panel, also said the language would outlaw any activity that has the effect of harassing, intimidating or coercing voters, regardless of whether that was the intent. And the threat of prosecution, she said, could “chill” individuals from engaging in otherwise legal political activity. “Indeed, it is inherent in the very nature of political and electoral expressive conduct that plaintiffs may not know which political issues may become relevant or offensive at the polls,” the judge wrote. “And it is inevitable that some political and election speech — matters of public concern — will have the effect of being offensive to someone.” But the judges punted on a separate question of whether Fontes can give himself the power to finalize election returns and declare winners even if the results from one or more counties are missing because their supervisors refused to certify the results. Wardlaw acknowledged that such an action, if it were to occur, could disenfranchise some Arizonan voters by leaving their votes out of the final tally. And that could change the results of some elections. She said, though, the challengers never made a clear showing that a county actually would balk at finalizing results. And that, Wardlaw wrote, meant they have no standing to contest the provision.</span></p>

The decision issued last week overrules a lower court’s order that blocked portions of the law from being enforced while the legal challenge brought by grassroots campaigners plays out. Known as H.B. 1205, the law sets new limits on how many petitions Florida voters can collect in their effort to get a constitutional amendment on the state’s ballot, a provision punishable by a felony if voters violate it. The measure also bars non-U.S. citizens and non-Florida residents from gathering signed petitions for ballot initiatives. The citizenship and residency provisions had been blocked under a July 8 ruling by U.S. District Judge Mark Walker. The three-judge panel of the Eleventh Circuit has overturned that, siding with arguments made by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ’ administration that the restrictions are needed to reform a constitutional amendment process that lawmakers claim has been tainted by fraud.</span></p>

March For Our Lives Idaho, along with the Idaho Alliance for Retired Americans, sued Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane over</span><a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0124/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 124</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/h0340/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 340</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — legislation that passed in 2023 eliminating student identification as a valid form of ID for voter registration and at the polls. House Bill 340 created a new list of acceptable ways to prove identity and residency to register to vote and allowed the Idaho Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a no-cost voter photo ID.  Attorney David Fox, arguing on behalf of March For Our Lives Idaho, said that laws were a “targeted strike on young voters.”  He said the laws violate the 26th Amendment of the Constitution, which states that U.S. citizens who are 18 years or older cannot have their right to vote denied or abridged on the basis of age.  Idaho Deputy Solicitor General Michael Zarian countered that the state is allowed to create reasonable restrictions on voting to ensure security, and that the laws in question “don’t place a special burden on anyone.”  “Any student who would have used a student ID before is now simply in line with the rest of the electorate who has always had to go to the DMV and obtain a compliant identification,” Zarian said.  </span></p>

The dispute began several years ago, when a group of Black voters filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the congressional map adopted by the Louisiana Legislature in 2022. That map contained only one majority-Black district, although nearly a third of the state’s population is Black. The Black voters contended that the 2022 map diluted the votes of Black residents. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case in March. On June 27, the justices announced that they would hear arguments in the case again during the 2025-26 term; they later directed the litigants to address a specific question: whether Louisiana’s intentional creation of a second majority-Black district violates either the 14th Amendment or the 15th Amendment, which bars both the federal government and states from denying or abridging the right to vote “on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” Both amendments were enacted in the wake of the Civil War in an effort to establish equality for formerly enslaved persons. In briefs filed at the Supreme Court late last month, Louisiana urged the justices to leave the lower court’s ruling that struck down the 2024 map in place, telling them that it “wants out of this abhorrent system of racial discrimination.” Race-based redistricting is unconstitutional, the state wrote, even if it occurs as a result of a desire to comply with Section 2. The Black voters, by contrast, continued to defend both the 2024 map and the VRA, telling the justices that the law “is the crown jewel of civil rights legislation.” In their briefs this week, the “non-African American” voters argued that Section 2 “heavily impinges on States’ sovereign power to regulate their elections and draw congressional districts.” Moreover, they added, “remedial ‘race-based districting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.’” The voters urged the Supreme Court to send the case back to the lower court quickly with instructions to “expeditiously finish what it almost completed in early 2024: a map based on traditional redistricting principles unburdened by any VRA quota.”</span></p>

No documents have yet shown up on the court record database PACER. But in a press release, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division said that it sued the two states and their respective secretaries of state for not providing information about voter list maintenance procedures and electronic copies of statewide voter registration lists. Bellows, a Democrat, has twice rejected the Trump administration’s requests for sensitive voter data, first on Aug. 8 and most recently on Sept. 8.</span></p>

If the nation’s highest court rules in Fitch’s favor, it would mean civil rights groups could no longer bring a suit on behalf of citizens. “This direct appeal presents an important legal question that has divided the courts of appeals: whether private parties may sue to enforce section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,” Fitch’s office writes. “The answer is no.” According to Mississippi Today, the AG’s office declined to comment on why it filed the appeal, which stems from a lawsuit brought by the Mississippi branch of the NAACP over the state’s legislative districts. The litigation resulted in a federal three-judge panel ruling last year that Mississippi’s legislative districts diluted Black-voting strength in three areas of the state. The panel, comprised of all George W. Bush-appointed judges, ordered lawmakers to redraw its districts to give Black voters in three areas of the state a fairer shot at electing candidates of their choice. Special elections for these races are currently ongoing, with the general election scheduled to happen in November.     </span></p>

Earlier this week, the board found that Walden was three months too late. “The court only has the authority to review whether the board of elections enforced the law reasonably, not whether the law itself is reasonable,” Pearlman wrote. “Here, as the board of elections followed the law precisely as written, refusing to accept a declination of candidacy more than 3 months after the deadline for such paperwork, the court finds that the board was not arbitrary and capricious.”</span></p>

The statute made it a crime for a convicted felon to cast a ballot before their voting rights have been restored. Critically, criminal intent was irrelevant — a person can be convicted even if they voted under the mistaken belief they were eligible to do so. The Reconstruction-era law was struck down last year by U.S. District Judge Loretta C. Biggs, a Barack Obama appointee, who wrote in an opinion that the law was “enacted with discriminatory intent” and “continues to disproportionately impact Black voters.” The Fourth Circuit reached the same conclusion. U.S. Circuit Judge DeAndrea Gist Benjamin, a Joe Biden appointee, writes in</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nc-felony-voter-appeal-opinion.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 25-page opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it’s impossible to separate the 1877 law from its racist origins. The statute does not explicitly mention race, but it was “propelled by the same wave of racism and resentment” that led to constitutional changes in the 1870s banning interracial marriage and mandating school segregation, Benjamin writes. And it continued to disproportionately impact Black voters, the court finds. Between 2015 and 2022, approximately 63% of the people who were investigated for violating the strict liability voting law were Black. Only 21 percent of the Tar Heel State population is Black.</span></p>

Oklahoma currently uses a closed partisan primary system, which denies roughly 466,000 registered independent voters a voice because they are not registered with the Democratic or Republican Party. Oklahoma United officially filed</span><a href="https://www.voteyes836.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> State Question 836</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SQ 836) in January. The initiative would do away with publicly funded party primaries and replace them with a nonpartisan open primary system that allows all voters and candidates, regardless of party, to participate on a single ballot. Then, the top vote-getters (in this case the top two) move on to a guaranteed general election. The initiative was challenged in court by the Oklahoma Republican Party and some of its members. They argued that the initiative summary (called the “gist”) was misleading, and the initiative threatened voters’ rights to association. In an 8-0 decision, the state Supreme Court disagreed – and ruled that the challenge was premature.  “The People’s right to propose law and amendments to the Oklahoma Constitution through the initiative process is precious, and any doubt as to the legal sufficiency of an initiative petition should be resolved in its favor,” Justice Douglas Combs wrote in the court’s opinion. The campaign for SQ836 is now clear to gather petition signatures. It will need nearly 173,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot.</span></p>

A 22-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene names Oregon and Secretary of State Tobias Read and alleges that the state broke federal laws by failing to provide electronic copies of statewide voter registration lists and information regarding voter list maintenance procedures. In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said states can’t pick and choose which federal laws they follow.  “American citizens have a right to feel confident in the integrity of our electoral process, and the refusal of certain states to protect their citizens against vote dilution will result in legal consequences,” Dhillon said. Read, a Democrat elected last year with promises to defend Oregon’s pioneering vote-by-mail system, said he looked forward to fighting the case in court. Oregon is already suing the federal government over Trump’s attempts to end mail voting, along with 36 other lawsuits. “If the president wants to use the DOJ to go after his political opponents and undermine our elections, I look forward to seeing them in court,” Read said. “I stand by my oath to the people of Oregon, and I will protect their rights and privacy.” The Justice Department said it’s alleging that Read violated federal law by refusing to share an unredacted electronic copy of the state’s voter registration list, provide information on the state’s voter list maintenance program or disclose registration information for any ineligible voters.</span></p>

In court filings, attorneys for the governor argued that turning over the data wouldn’t cause harm to South Carolinians since the federal government already has virtually all the information in one place or another, though privacy advocates noted that some of that data is shielded from Justice Department access.</span></p>

From partisan gerrymandering and primary systems that drive polarization to calls for proportional representation and ranked-choice voting, Americans are increasingly debating how electoral structures shape the health of our republic. This event—part of R Street’s 250th Anniversary Series—brings together R Street’s Governance Policy Director, Matthew Germer; political analyst Chris Stirewalt; and legal scholar Walter Olson to explore the landscape of electoral reform and what it means for American democracy at 250. Together, they will examine: How current electoral practices affect representation, accountability, and public trust. The range of reforms under discussion, from proportional representation to ranked-choice voting and beyond. The legal, political, and cultural barriers to reform. How the Founders’ principles—equality, popular sovereignty, and civic virtue—might guide us in strengthening democratic institutions today. A reception will follow to continue the conversation. <strong>When:</strong> October 21. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC. </span></p>
