							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Fostering Resilient Elections </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">A New Report on Strengthening Preparedness and Collaboration</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Andrea Byrne (Center for Tech and Civic Life Cybersecurity Advisor), Karen Brinson Bell (Advance Elections), Carolina Lopez (Partnership for Large Election Jurisdictions) and TJ Pyche (The Elections Group) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergencies don’t wait for ballots to be counted. Natural disasters, cyber incidents, and infrastructure failures can strike at any point in the election cycle, disrupting operations, jeopardizing voter access, and undermining public confidence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13621" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NewserFeature10.23.25-228x300.png" alt="" width="228" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NewserFeature10.23.25-228x300.png 228w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NewserFeature10.23.25-777x1024.png 777w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NewserFeature10.23.25-768x1012.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NewserFeature10.23.25.png 1058w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" />A new report from the Center for Tech and Civic Life, </span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fostering-Resilient-Elections-FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fostering Resilient Elections: Opportunities for Stronger Election Administration and Emergency Management Collaboration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, highlights how election officials and emergency managers can build stronger partnerships to safeguard elections in the face of disruption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report draws on extensive conversations with dozens of election officials and emergency managers from across the country. The perspectives shared come from officials who have managed elections and emergency response through hurricanes, wildfires, winter storms and security incidents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their collective experience underscores that collaboration between elections and emergency management is essential, but remains uneven across jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some communities, election officials and emergency managers know each other well and maintain well-tested plans for navigating crises. In others, officials are still “trading business cards in the middle of a hurricane,” forced to improvise relationships and coordination at the worst possible moment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This report argues that proactive engagement – building ties before an emergency strikes – can save time, reduce confusion, and protect both voters and the integrity of an election. </span></p>
<p><strong>Key Recommendations</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report outlines practical opportunities for collaboration, such as integrating election officials into emergency communications systems, engaging in joint planning and tabletop exercises, and aligning financial preparedness with after-action reviews. At the same time, it acknowledges cultural and structural differences between the two fields – from divergent definitions of “mission critical” to conflicting timelines – that can complicate coordination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report offers the following recommendations for three key groups:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials should maintain regular contact with emergency management counterparts, participate in interagency planning and exercises, and document emergency communications, continuity, and response plans well ahead of each election. They should also assess election facilities and vendor relationships through a resilience lens and prepare financial documentation that allows for quick access to emergency resources.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency managers are encouraged to designate election liaisons before each election, integrate election-specific risks into their broader emergency plans, and include election officials in trainings and exercises. Their role in supporting continuity of election operations during crises is critical to ensuring election needs are prioritized alongside other essential services.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civil society can help by creating opportunities for relationship-building, cross-sector learning, and joint problem-solving. Developing training materials and model resources, providing technical assistance, and advocating for policy changes and resources will further strengthen the ability of election officials and emergency managers to withstand disruption.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections are zero-fail events, and emergencies that disrupt them can have consequences far beyond a single community. Building stronger ties between election officials and emergency managers is not just a matter of efficiency – it is a matter of protecting the right to vote, even in the face of disruption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage readers to </span><a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fostering-Resilient-Elections-FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explore the full report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for detailed recommendations, case studies, and resources. By strengthening collaboration now, we can ensure that when the next emergency strikes, our elections are better protected.</span></p>

According to NPR, the Postal Service has</span><a href="https://about.usps.com/newsroom/statements/082625-federal-register-notice-of-additional-postmarking-information.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposed revising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its</span><a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/dmm300_landing.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mailing standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to say that postmark date &#8220;does not inherently or necessarily align&#8221; with the date that a mail piece was first accepted by a letter carrier or dropped off at a post office or collection box. &#8220;In other words, the date on a machine-applied postmark may reflect the date on which the mailpiece was first accepted by the Postal Service, but that is not definitively the case,&#8221; USPS said in a recent</span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/12/2025-15266/postmarks-and-postal-possession"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Federal Register notice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

A U.S. Postal Service </span><a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/us-postal-service-ballot-return-california-election-hubs/69113458"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that took effect in April could lead to delays in postmarking for </span><a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2025/10/07/voting-by-mail-voters-urged-to-vote-early-in-californias-special-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voters who live more than 50 miles from a</span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/Voting%20Rights%20Social%20-%20Map.jpg"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regional hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including in rural areas of Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Stanislaus counties. &#8220;In many parts of California, recent changes in the U.S. postal mail service mean your ballot may not be counted if you drop it off at a post office or a USPS mail box on election day,&#8221; Attorney General Rob Bonta said. &#8220;This is true for any community that is more than 50 miles from one of California&#8217;s six regional mail processing facilities.&#8221; </span></p>

Elections Administrator Bradly Seaman said his office has rejected nearly 170 ballots thus far due to their lack of a signature or birth year – both of which are now required on the outside of the return envelope. “It&#8217;s significant. We&#8217;ve been referring to it as a ten-times increase,” Seaman said. “We&#8217;ll contact voters and let them know they missed this. We&#8217;ve seen municipal races come down to a dead tie and we know every vote counts. We want to make sure voters are aware of it.” In response to the county&#8217;s concern, the Secretary of State&#8217;s office said nearly 80% of the ballots rejected statewide due to missing or non-matching information “appear to be from Missoula County.” “Missoula&#8217;s high rejection rate during this election shouldn&#8217;t be attributed to a new law, as it appears to be concentrated in Missoula County,” said Austin James, the Elections Director at the Secretary of State&#8217;s office. The Legislature this year passed HB 719, sponsored by Rep. Braxton Mitchell, a Flathead County Republican. The measure revised a number of voting laws and deemed a ballot to be void and not countable if not properly signed. “We direct a lot of that (complaints) to the bill&#8217;s sponsor and the Secretary of State,” Seaman said. “We&#8217;re working hard to let people know there&#8217;s a change to this envelope, and to know that it&#8217;s statewide and that it&#8217;s required.”</span></p>

The Board of Elections will also join the Department of State at monthly naturalization ceremonies organized by the U.S. District Court. At tables set up outside of the naturalization ceremonies, elections officials will answer new citizens’ questions about elections in Rhode Island and assist in registering them to vote. “Naturalization ceremonies are joyous occasions for new citizens eager to contribute to and participate in our nation’s democracy,” Rhode Island Board of Elections Chairwoman Jennifer Johnson said in a media release. “There is nothing more fundamental to being a citizen than the right to vote,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;That is why the Board of Elections is proud to step up alongside the Department of State and local Boards of Canvassers to offer voter registration services and information about voting in Rhode Island elections to these newly naturalized U.S. citizens.”</span></p>

This year’s </span><a href="https://kdvr.com/news/politics/election/it-smells-like-democracy-jeffcos-i-voted-stickers-get-a-nostalgic-twist/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jefferson County, Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “I Voted” stickers will be scratch and sniff stickers. Yes, you read that right. “The I Voted sticker has always been a symbol of civic pride, but there’s also some nostalgia wrapped up in it that many voters remember from their childhood, and voting with a parent,” said Jefferson County Clerk and Recorder Amanda Gonzalez to FOX31. “Scratch ‘n’ sniff stickers have that same sense of nostalgia and fun and we thought it’d be a great opportunity to combine the two and bring that joy to voting.” The scratch-and-sniff stickers show a county ballot drop box along with an array of Colorado wild flowers. The clerk and recorder’s office said the community even voted from a selection of scented options to see which one “smelled the most like democracy.” “Voting should be something people look forward to. The scratch ‘n’ sniff sticker adds a bit of fun and celebration to the process—it’s a small way to make civic participation feel special. And if it brings more people out to vote, all the better,” said Gonzalez. The stickers <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-13622" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ChelseaMAIVoted25-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />are only available in person at the seven polling centers in the county, which will open in phases starting Oct. 27, according to the clerk and recorder’s office. However, county voters who mailed in their ballots can still stop in to get a scratch-and-sniff sticker if they want one. “It smells like democracy,” Gonzalez said.

Participants were asked to create original, nonpartisan designs that prominently featured the words “I Voted.” Adrian’s sticker, which features a cheerful cat giving a thumbs up with the words “I Voted,” on it. “This design contest was created to encourage voter turnout and bring more attention to the local election,” said City Manager Fidel Maltez. “Adrian’s design captures the spirit of civic pride in a fun, relatable, and memorable way. We’re proud to showcase local creativity at our polling places and find creative ways to engage residents of all ages in the democratic process.” All submissions were reviewed by a panel of city officials, who selected a group of finalists based on creativity, originality, and alignment with the contest guidelines. The finalists’ designs were then posted online for a public vote, which received a total of 658 responses.</span></p>

With input from local election officials, Better Choices for Democracy conducted a national survey of 1,633 U.S. adults (margin of error +/- 2.4% at 95% confidence interval) in October 2025 using</span><a href="https://www.alpharoc.ai/occam"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AlphaRoc’s Occam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platform to understand how the public views the use of AI in election administration, including which applications they find acceptable, how disclosure impacts confidence, and how sources of information impact confidence in election administration. The organization found that even if the public accepts AI use under certain conditions, confidence is strongly contingent on source, transparency, and visible human oversight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Findings: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans approach the use of AI in election administration with tepid openness.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust in election communication remains strongly tied to human sources and official channels, and the majority of Americans want clear labeling of AI-generated or AI-assisted content. About three-quarters of Americans say they are very or somewhat confident in information received directly from election officials, and a nearly identical 72% express confidence in information found on official election office websites. Confidence falls to about half for official chatbots and even lower for social media posts (38%).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attitudes toward AI in election administration vary sharply by age, gender, education, and partisanship. Younger, college-educated, and frequent AI users are more accepting of AI in administrative tasks like translation or answering voter questions, while older adults and infrequent users express greater skepticism.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across all groups, a majority say it is important for election offices to disclose when AI is used. However, disclosure alone does not necessarily increase trust. Roughly one-quarter of adults say disclosure would increase confidence in their local election officials, one-quarter say it would decrease confidence, and one-third say it would have no effect. Younger respondents and those with a college degree are more likely to report that disclosure would improve confidence, while older and less frequent AI users are more skeptical.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly one-third of adults report encountering false or misleading information about elections through AI tools. These experiences correlate with stronger views, both supportive and skeptical, about the use of AI in election administration.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the findings suggest that while Americans see potential for AI to improve election administration, maintaining transparency, oversight, and human accountability is essential for sustaining public confidence.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recommendations: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tailor education and engagement by demographic segment and start with low-risk, high-acceptability tasks. Because attitudes vary based on frequency of usage and demographics, election officials should tailor their rollout and education strategies to particular audiences. Older adults, less frequent AI users, and those wary of automation may need greater explanation, field demos, and trust-building outreach.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prioritize clear, consistent disclosure and branding. Labels, footers, disclosure pages, and public reports should emphasize human review, process transparency, and how to verify official status (e.g., logo/trust mark).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pair transparency with accountability. Disclosure is not enough on its own; governance, oversight, audits, and recourse mechanisms must accompany it to convert disclosure into trust.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address false and misleading information directly. Distinguish AI-assisted official sources from third-party tools, provide easy verification steps, and correct widely circulating AI-fueled errors proactively. Experience with false and misleading information when using AI tools deepens skepticism and shapes demand for protections. Managing confusability between official and non-official AI is critical.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By grounding adoption in public opinion, election officials can ensure that the use of AI reflects both administrative needs and democratic values, reinforcing voter trust in how elections are run and in the public servants who run elections.</span></p>

Tina Polsky (D- Boca Raton) is refiling a bill that proposes a statewide database to reduce legal uncertainty and assist individuals with certain felony convictions in </span><a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/761062-tina-polsky-renews-push-to-restore-felon-voting-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoring their voting rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Polsky filed the revised measure (</span><a href="https://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=82641"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 132</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), which aims to streamline the process of restoring the voting rights of individuals with certain felony convictions, and help determine whether they’ve met the legal criteria for restoration under Florida law. Polsky filed an almost identical bill (</span><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/848"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 848</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) during the 2025 Legislative Session; however, the bill died during its passage through the Criminal Justice Committee. The Florida Commission on Offender Review would be required to develop and maintain a centralized, publicly accessible database that contains information for individuals disqualified from voting due to felony convictions, excluding individuals who have been convicted of murder or felony sexual offenses. The database would be required to contain information for individuals, including their name, and other identifying information. It would need to include information on outstanding restitution, fines, fees, and the remaining length of any term of supervision, such as probation, community control, or parole ordered by the court as part of his or her sentence.</span></p>

The proposed charter amendment would establish the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of each general election year as the date for mayor and city council races. The ordinance will come back for first and second readings before the ballot question can appear before voters in March 2026. Councilman David Schmidt, who made the motion to advance the proposal, argued that current low turnout creates voter fatigue. “I think a real voter fatigue is after they go through an exhausting nationwide campaign and turn around and they see a whole bunch more signs in January and February that have to do with another election that historically our record has been like 11% voter turnout,” he said. Under the proposal, seats one through four, elected in 2023, would next appear on the ballot Nov. 3, 2026, with terms beginning April 1, 2027. Seats five through seven and the mayor’s office, elected in 2025, would be on the Nov. 7, 2028 ballot, with terms starting April 1, 2029. On October 28, the proposed ordinance language will be brought back to council for approval. First reading will be at the November 18 meeting, followed by second reading on December 16. The change would require approval by a majority of voters to take effect.</span></p>

Board member Janice Johnston, a GOP appointee who introduced the recommendation, said that absentee voting “should be the exception rather than the rule,” arguing that it poses a higher risk of voter fraud. She also argued that Georgia’s three-week early voting period makes absentee voting unnecessary. Board Chair John Fervier vehemently opposed the recommendation, arguing that restrictions on absentee ballot access would place an unnecessary burden on voters, particularly low-income voters. “There are a lot of people out there that work seven days a week to feed their families, make ends meet — especially now — and restricting their access to absentee voting is not fair to those people,” Fervier said. “When you have to earn a dollar every day to feed your family, you can’t take a day off to go vote,” he added. Sara Tindall Ghazal, the only Democratic member of the board, also opposed the proposal, arguing that there wasn’t a clear reason to change the law and noting that absentee ballots only account for a small percentage of votes cast in Georgia. During the 2024 election, roughly 5% of voters cast an absentee ballot. The board also voted 3-1 to recommend that the Legislature limit the amount of time overseas and military voters have to return absentee ballots. The board also voted 2-0 to begin the rulemaking process for a bipartisan proposal that aims to clarify the circumstances under which voters can use paper ballots rather than ballot-marking devices.</span></p>

Don Jensen, chairman of the La Salle County Board, circulated an email Thursday advising board members that he would not sign the recently enacted increase in compensation for election judges. “I’m all about fair and well-run elections,” Jensen said, “but I think that pay increase is excessive.” The proposed increase was from $185 to $300, a jump of 62.2%. The county board adopted the raise on Oct. 9 by a vote of 16-11. Despite the majority vote, Jensen cited board rules giving him the authority not to sign the ordinance. “I believe the pay increase is not appropriate, it being a 62.2% increase and by the information given by the County Clerk, that level of pay is not necessary to attract people to fill the spots,” Jensen told board members via email. “The goal of having adequate numbers of election judges to run the polls to ensure fair, well-run elections should also be considered along with the cost to the taxpayers.” Jensen said the ordinance would be brought back to the full board on Nov. 3 for reconsideration. County Clerk Jennifer Ebner issued a brief statement when asked for comment. “Per advice from the (La Salle County) States Attorney’s Office, this is a valid course of action the county board chairman can take.”</span></p>

The decision, which was unanimous, came on the heels of discussions to possibly eliminate polling places at Tangier, Lyford and Bridgeton.  &#8220;We want everyone to have access, and that&#8217;s why this is so important now. People have the same access they have always have, and now they have more and can go anyplace to vote. If they are working someplace and didn&#8217;t have a chance to go vote at 6 in the morning, now they can go vote on their lunch or whatever. I think it will open up for more people to vote anyway. The whole idea is to make it easier on people to get more people out,&#8221; Commissioner Jim Meece said.  Nicole Collings, Parke County Clerk, told the commissioners that after an election or two, they will re-examine the vote center idea, but for now, there will be nine vote centers. </span></p>

Jeff Landry has summoned the Louisiana Legislature for a t</span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2025/10/16/gov-landry-calls-legislature-into-three-week-special-session-on-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hree-week special session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> starting this week to address next year’s election plans.  The special session will begin Thursday, Oct. 23,  and end no later than Nov. 13. Lawmakers will be allowed to file bills related to “election code, election dates, election deadlines, and election plans for the 2026 election cycle” and funding bills related to those items.  The governor’s call is broadly written and could allow for a wide variety of election bills. Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said that the governor told him that Landry’s priorities are to move back qualifying deadlines for next fall’s election to give the state an opportunity to react to a U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling expected sometime next spring. Justices heard arguments last week in Callais v. Louisiana, a decision that could require or allow the adoption of new congressional maps. Henry said no new maps would be drawn in this session.</span></p>

Some veterans raised concerns that this could prevent military and overseas ballots from being counted. Right now, ballots will still be counted when returned within four days of the election, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. In 2023, a massive election overhaul bill changed the deadline from the seventh day after the election to the fourth. But state lawmakers want to change that. “We want to make sure that something as precious as your vote is being done accurately and that our voters know we’re doing things correctly,” state Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, said. Gavarone and state Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, introduced</span><a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb293"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 293</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, requiring all ballots to be returned by the close of polls on election night. Gavarone said that sometimes ballots are received without being postmarked, so they may not be counted. “Your ballot has to be received on election day, on or before, so that there won’t be any ambiguity,” Gavarone said. Brenner said that he had been working with Secretary of State Frank LaRose and his team on the bill. Veterans argue that this could disenfranchise anyone voting by mail, especially military personnel. According to state data, about 17,000 of the more than one million Ohioans who voted by mail in 2024’s presidential election were military. Overall, nearly 10,000 ballots came in during the four days after the election.</span></p>

The first bill committee members advanced would increase the $100 potential maximum fine for defying a legislative subpoena to $750, which is a more common figure associated with six-month misdemeanors across state law. The nine committee members present voted in favor of that. The second bill would specify that submitting a false post-election audit to the Wyoming Secretary of State’s Office is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines. The third bill would layer transparency onto the post-election audit process, requiring the county clerk to notify the county chairman of each political party represented on the ballot, and a representative of all independent candidates of the time and place of the audit. It would require two or more electors of that county, from different political parties, to attend and observe the audit and its results. In Wyoming, electors of a county and/or the county commissioners may submit a complaint to the governor, asking the governor to remove a county official from office, state law says. The fourth bill the committee advanced would make the secretary of state a valid complainant when the alleged misconduct is an election offense.</span></p>

U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston on October 16 put the lawsuit brought by law firm Todd &amp; Weld on hold for 30 days after Newsmax and Todd &amp; Weld said, pausing the case would &#8220;facilitate ongoing settlement discussions.&#8221; Newsmax said in a statement it &#8220;has paid Todd &amp; Weld close to 95% of all bills invoiced but we are disputing Howard Cooper&#8217;s billing and performance on several matters.&#8221; Cooper is a founding partner at Todd &amp; Weld. A spokesperson for Boston-based Todd &amp; Weld did not immediately respond to request for comment. Todd &amp; Weld sued Newsmax last month, alleging that the company still owes more than $426,000 for its work defending Newsmax in a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. The law firm alleged that Newsmax &#8220;acknowledges&#8221; the firm is owed fees but &#8220;simply refuses to pay.&#8221;</span></p>

The Court issued an</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26189190-decisionorder-5647199-0pdf/#document/p1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> order late last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reversing a March decision from the Arizona Court of Appeals which ruled that Secretary of State Adrian Fontes violated the Arizona Administrative Procedures Act when he didn’t allow enough time for public comment on the 2023 Election Procedures Manual.  “I am relieved and gratified by today’s decision,” Fontes said in a statement. “The rule of law has prevailed. The Court’s unanimous order confirms what every Secretary of State, Republican and Democrat alike, has always understood: the Legislature created a distinct process for adopting the Elections Procedures Manual, and that process stands apart from the Administrative Procedures Act.” The 2023 manual, as well as the 2025 version — which is not yet finalized — have both been heavily criticized by Republicans, who take issue with multiple guidelines and rules added by Fontes, a Democrat. Fontes deleted some portions of the 2023 EPM from the new version in response to other court cases that challenged or blocked those provisions.  In February 2024, the Republican National Committee sued, joined by the state and Yavapai County branches of the party, alleging that the 2023 EPM was “designed to undermine election integrity in Arizona.” In May 2024, a trial court dismissed the RNC’s arguments that Fontes violated the Administrative Procedures Act in creating the 2023 EPM by allowing only 15 days for public comment instead of 30, concluding that the Administrative Procedures Act didn’t apply to the EPM. The RNC appealed that decision.  In March, the Arizona Court of Appeals overturned the trial court’s decision. The Arizona Supreme Court issued a short, two-page order overturning that appellate decision and sending the case back to the appeals court to determine whether any of the eight specific EPM provisions that the RNC challenged in the suit violate state law. </span></p>

The Board of Supervisors, a five-member elected panel led by four Republicans, has been planning to contract a third-party vendor to conduct a systemwide assessment of election infrastructure. However, Heap believes the board is overstepping its authority and filed a request for a temporary restraining order to stop the audit last week. The judge responded to the filing on Friday by setting an evidentiary hearing for Nov. 6, when each side will have 45 minutes to make its case. When it comes to the audit, Heap said he wasn’t involved in the process to select a vendor and has concerns about giving third-party auditors access to sensitive information about Maricopa County’s 2.6 million registered voters.</span></p>

Carlton Wing resigned to become the new executive director and CEO of Arkansas PBS. On Oct. 10, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders scheduled special primary and general elections for March 3 and June 9, 2026, respectively, to select a new representative for the district, which includes portions of Pulaski County.  The dates are the same as the Senate District 26 special election, which is being challenged in a separate lawsuit. A Pulaski County circuit judge who held a hearing in that case last week said she would rule quickly. Sam Dubke, a Sanders spokesperson, issued a statement saying  the governor, in consultation with election officials, “decided that lining up the District 70 special election with the District 26 special election is just common sense, saves taxpayer dollars, and ensures the election is free, fair, and secure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pulaski County Judge Patricia James ruled in favor of a Franklin County resident and said a </span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/10/22/far-reaching-ramifications-judge-says-special-election-dates-violate-constitutional-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June 2026 special election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fill a vacant state Senate seat unconstitutionally deprives voters of a voice in next year’s legislative session. James’</span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ABCG925AVK6FRUSA73TDVVUZEHV3YP.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eight-page ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> orders the state to hold the election “as soon as practicable” after the legal limit of 150 days from the vacancy to ensure that the date for the special election “will not infringe upon or curtail the constitutional and fundamental rights of the citizens of Arkansas Senate District 26.” Attorney General Tim Griffin and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said through spokespersons that they plan to appeal. James’ ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by Colt Shelby of Cecil against Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester over Sanders’ decision last month to schedule a special election in the district after the death of Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch. Sanders originally set the election for Nov. 13, but after bipartisan pushback she revised the general election date to June 9, 2026. That date would still occur after the end of the fiscal session, set to begin April 8 and end May 7. State law requires that special elections to fill legislative vacancies be held no later than 150 days after the vacancy, unless it is “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so. James said in her ruling that setting the dates in June, after multiple county election officials testified that earlier dates were possible, amounted to “an infringement of a constitutional right based on the fundamental democratic principle of ‘no taxation without representation.’”</span></p>

The state of California, as well as Huntington Beach resident Mark Bixby, are trying to overturn a ruling made in April by an Orange County Superior Court judge who determined the city would be within its right to require voter identification in municipal elections. Oral arguments in both related cases were heard in back-to-back hearings this week. Huntington Beach voters in a March 2024 special election passed Measure A, adding into the city’s charter that officials “may” institute those requirements beginning in 2026. Earlier this year, O.C. Superior Court Judge Nico Dourbetas ruled that a voter ID requirement would not compromise the integrity of a local election. California Deputy Atty. Gen. Michael Cohen, arguing on behalf of the state, noted state election policy has traditionally out ruled local control. He added that with the charter amendment, Huntington Beach could require its residents to vote twice, at two different locations, on Election Day.

Michael J. Polelle is a former attorney and emeritus professor at the University of Illinois Chicago School of Law. An independent voter, he was upset after moving to Sarasota in 2012 and learning that as a nonparty-affiliated (NPA) voter, he was shut out of county commission primaries because of the state’s closed system. Without the aid of a law firm but with assistance from some of the legal contacts he’s maintained in Chicago, he filed a lawsuit in 2022 in the U.S. Middle District Court of Florida challenging the state’s ban on open primaries, saying it violates his rights under the First Amendment and Equal Protection Clause to political free speech and association. Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd and Sarasota County Supervisor of Elections Ron Turner were listed as defendants. U.S. District Judge Steven D. Merryday dismissed the case in November 2022, ruling that Polelle lacked standing and had failed to state a claim for relief. Merryday also found that Florida’s interest in preventing unaffiliated voters’ potential to undermine a political party’s candidate-selection process outweighed his desire to vote in a partisan primary election, especially given the minimal burdens that Florida law imposes on voters who wish to join or switch political parties. He then filed an appeal last year with the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

Olivia Coley-Pearson is suing the county election board and former election supervisor Emily Misty Martin. Coley-Pearson was an elected commissioner for the city of Douglas in Coffee County when a city policeman arrested her at a polling site during early voting in 2020. Martin had called police on Coley-Pearson, complaining she was causing a disruption while helping voters. Police issued a criminal trespass warning, but Coley-Pearson returned later that day and was arrested. Coley-Pearson had a long history of helping illiterate voters cast their ballots. After the criminal case against her was dismissed in 2022, she sued Martin and the Coffee County Board of Elections, alleging violation of her constitutional rights to free speech and against false arrest. A federal judge in Atlanta ruled against Coley-Pearson in 2023, so she appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled against her Tuesday.</span></p>

The plaintiffs also sought information on the Hoosiers affected. The</span><a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10.21.2025NVRACRAComplaint-Stamped.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was filed in the U.S. District Court for Indiana’s Southern District. It names Secretary of State Diego Morales as a defendant, along with Indiana Election Division Co-Directors Bradley King and Angela Nussmeyer. “Since July 1, 2025, Indiana has started to enforce laws that rely on stale, error-ridden data and demand that only certain U.S. citizens produce documentary proof of citizenship to register or to remain registered to vote,” the complaint reads. It goes on to allege the requirements “risk disenfranchising eligible Hoosier voters” who are naturalized citizens, or who derived citizenship through their parents’ naturalization. One of the statutes, 2024’s House Enrolled Act 1264, requires designated National Voter Registration Act officials to compare the state voter rolls with an Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles database to identify registered voters who hold temporary driver’s licenses or identification cards. The other, 2025’s House Enrolled Act 1680, applies to those who register to vote with temporary credential numbers. Under both laws, county election officials send notices to flagged Hoosiers, who have 30 days to provide proof of citizenship. Otherwise, under the first law, they’re stripped from the voter rolls, and under the second, their registration applications are rejected. The plaintiffs allege the laws violate the NVRA and Civil Rights Act because they discriminate against naturalized and derived citizens. The statutes also demand information that isn’t “equivalent” to federal requirements, they wrote.</span></p>

Alban determined the voters had standing to file their case, but she has yet to decide whether she’ll dismiss the case on other grounds raised by the defendants — or allow it to proceed. She said she will issue a written ruling in the coming days. Alban indicated she was skeptical of the voters’ arguments</span><a href="https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DARS-Complaint-FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that their claims were not resolved by prior case law, but said she planned to continue considering the “nuance” of the law. “I want to think about it a bit more,” Alban said. “I imagine no matter what I do, this may not be the end.” The group of voters in the Maryland suit are challenging the fact that the state government funds primary elections that are not open to all voters, since voters must generally affiliate with the Democratic or Republican party to cast their ballots in primaries — unless it’s a non-partisan race. Their suit names the State Board of Elections and various state officials as defendants. Daniel Kobrin, an assistant attorney general representing the defendants, argued that the case was focused on an alleged “waste of taxpayer money,” and that the plaintiffs didn’t have the standing to sue based on their status as taxpayers. Eric Gunderson, an attorney for the voters, said that the plaintiffs are not arguing that the state shouldn’t fund primaries. Rather, they are arguing that, if the state continues to sponsor those elections, they should be open to all. The political parties could opt to fund their own primary elections if they wished to continue restricting participation, Gunderson said. Alban agreed with him, ruling that the case was an elections matter — not a taxpayer one — and that the five plaintiffs had standing to sue because they are all registered voters in the state.</span></p>

Councilman Muhtasin Sadman was accused of forging an absentee ballot and aiding two unqualified electors to vote in the 2023 election. Monroe County Assistant Prosecutor Ragan Lake said the two witnesses did not appear despite being served subpoenas to attend court October 20. Sadman was charged with forging a signature on an absentee ballot, election law forgery, two counts of aiding an unqualified elector in an attempt to vote and making a false statement on an absentee ballot. All are felonies except the making a false statement on an absentee ballot charge, which is a misdemeanor. Judge Alexis Krot in Hamtramck&#8217;s 31st District Court set a pretrial date in November to continue with the prosecution of the misdemeanor case.</span></p>

Prezzato was one of four voters accused in the case in St. Clair Shores. He pleaded guilty Sept. 3 to one count of election law-voting absentee and in person. The Michigan Attorney General&#8217;s Office dismissed another charge — offering to vote more than once — at sentencing Oct. 22 before Circuit Judge Anthony Servitto. In addition to probation, Prezzato received credit for one day served in the county jail, according to online court records. According to those records and a prior news release from the attorney general&#8217;s office, Prezzato sought to delay sentencing for six months and upon successful completion of probation, the charge to which he entered his plea would be dismissed with prejudice. The delayed sentencing hearing is set for April 15 in the circuit court.</span></p>

Negotiations had to pause because of the ongoing federal shutdown since Sept. 30. The motion states that without federal funding, Justice Department attorneys can’t work, even on a voluntary basis. It asks to pause the case until Evnen can reopen discussions, but to resume it no more than 60 days after the shutdown ends. “It is in the interest of judicial economy and conducive to an efficient resolution of this matter that this agreement be completed and available for production before the next stages of litigation,” the motion states. Evnen anticipates the discussions “will yield an agreement that will impact the arguments made in this case,” according to the motion. That could mean getting in writing how the privacy of the voter information — names, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers — would be protected. The motion also confirms that Evnen will not send the requested voter data to the federal government during the course of the lawsuit.</span></p>

The clerk also received an anonymous letter accusing Gato of potentially attempting to vote for her deceased mother. Gato, according to an email to Patch and an affidavit, was caregiver for her mother, Ruby Ponce, who died on Oct. 15, 2024. Eight days after her mother’s passing, Gato went to the town clerk’s office to obtain an absentee ballot for her mother on Oct. 21, 2024, an affidavit said. She submitted the ballot application and signed an attestation saying she was assisting her mother because she had a disability, the report said. The affidavit said there was probable cause for two charges against Galo: One for wrongful voting; penalties for voter fraud and applying for an absentee ballot in a name other than her own. The attorney general’s office is pursuing one count.</span></p>

On Oct. 10, a state appellate division court said the format the county clerk’s office used was in clear violation of New Jersey law. This ruling came as result of a lawsuit filed by members of the Gloucester County GOP committee, plus county commissioner candidates Jonathan M. Sammons and Byron Driscoll. The decision also reverses the greater part of a county Superior Court order issued Oct. 7 in the case. Attorneys Josiah Contarino of Newark and Marla DeMarcantonio of Woodbury represented the plaintiffs. The defendants were County Clerk James N. Hogan, Deputy County Clerk Heather Pool, county Elections Superintendent Stephanie Salvatore and members of the county&#8217;s board of elections. “I just wanted to first say — we’re happy with this result,” Contarino said Thursday, Oct. 16. “We think it’s showing that voting done in accordance with the governing law is important, not just for election integrity but also voter confidence.” County residents who vote in person, including those using early voting opportunities, are to be presented with an amended ballot. Sample ballots, which are to be mailed out soon, are also to be revised.</span></p>

The ruling by the seven justices on the state&#8217;s highest court puts an end to a lengthy legal battle over a law New York Democrats adopted in 2023 that moves most town and county races outside of New York City to even-numbered years to coincide with races for Congress, governor or president. The change excludes villages and races for county clerk, sheriff, district attorneys, local judges and others protected under the state Constitution. &#8220;The Court of Appeals&#8217; unanimous decision to uphold New York’s even-year election law is a victory for democracy and all New Yorkers,&#8221; Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement. &#8220;I championed this legislation because I believe our state is stronger when more people have the opportunity to make their voices heard. By aligning local elections with the state and federal calendar, we’re making it easier for New Yorkers to participate in government. At a time when voting rights are under attack across the nation, New York is proudly moving in the opposite direction.” The decision ends a longstanding legal challenge spearheaded by Republican leaders in Onondaga County, who argued the change erodes the power of local governments and it conflicts with individual county charters.</span></p>

Andrews, Jr. rejected a request for a temporary restraining order and found the plaintiffs had not presented evidence to support their allegations of illegality, fraud, or conflict of interest. The case was brought by board members Lawrence Boschulte, Harriet Mercer, and Atanya Springette, along with Collister Fahie, who represented the group pro se. The plaintiffs asked the court to remove Williams from his position and from the board, claiming the Board of Elections had met without a quorum and that Williams’s roles as board chair, executive director of the V.I. Lottery, and a commissioner on the V.I. Public Services Commission created a conflict of interest. They also alleged “illegal activities,” fraud, and constitutional violations. Andrews dismissed all counts, concluding the plaintiffs failed to substantiate their claims. He noted that no documentary evidence supported the wide-ranging accusations; plaintiffs relied on witness statements that did not establish the alleged wrongdoing.</span></p>

According to Votebeat, attorneys for the Wisconsin Department of Justice wrote that the Waukesha County Circuit Court decision was “impermissively vague” and would require election officials to disregard multiple voter registration laws. The appeal follows a request for a stay, filed last week, in which the attorneys told the court it would be virtually impossible for the election commission to implement Maxwell’s decision by the February statewide election, and that it would illegally have to shut down online voter registration in the meantime. In response, Maxwell stayed the part of his ruling that required citizenship verification for new registrants, but let stand the part requiring the Wisconsin Elections Commission to verify the citizenship of all currently registered voters.</span></p>

Join Issue One’s panel of cyber security experts as we discuss Issue One’s latest report and hear how partisanship is hamstringing our response to foreign cyber threats. We will hear a first hand example with a short exploration of Congress’ failure to reauthorize the Cyber Infrastructure Security Act of 2015 and the urgent need for a full 10-year reauthorization. Panelists include: Kim Wyman: Former Washington Secretary of State and Senior Election Security Advisor at CISA and current President of Election Security &amp; Innovation Consulting; Patrick J. Murphy: Executive Director at Hilco Global’s Geopolitical Advisory Unit, former Under Secretary of the Army, and the first Iraq War veteran elected to Congress and Laura Edelson: Former Chief Technologist at DoJ and current Co-director of Cybersecurity for Democracy. <strong>When:</strong> October 24, 9am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</span></p>

The program will feature back-to-back fireside chats with experts who are advancing participatory governance in communities around the United States. From local democracy forums to grassroots coalitions, panelists will discuss how they are building trust, collectively solving everyday problems, and strengthening civic life at the local level. This interactive conversation will bring together practitioners from inside and outside government who are reimagining how residents and institutions work together. We will explore how culture—our shared norms, stories, and ways of engaging—shapes the practice of democracy, and why that matters more than ever in an era of national polarization and fractured federal infrastructure. Participants will gain insights into innovative approaches that foster belonging, bridge divides, and widen civic participation in decision-making. Whether through public assemblies, co-governance models, or creative community-building, these leaders are showing how democratic culture can be sustained and renewed from the ground up. <strong>When:</strong> October 24. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC. </span></p>
