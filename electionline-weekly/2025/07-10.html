Since 2008, this project has included a separate survey, the Election Administration Policy Survey (Policy Survey), that gathers information about state election laws, policies, and practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey covers topics such as voter participation, voter registration, voter list maintenance, and election technology, as well as early and Election Day polling place operations for the general election. The 2024 results reflect a 100% response rate from all 50 states, five U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024, nearly 65% of the citizen voting age population participated in the general election, resulting in more than 158 million counted ballots. Over 72% of voters cast their votes in person at a voting location, either before Election Day or on Election Day. Over 98% of election jurisdictions used voting equipment that has voters mark a paper ballot or produces an auditable paper record of voters’ ballot preferences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The EAVS gathers data directly from those who manage our elections: state and local election officials. This sets the EAVS apart and further highlights why it is the most comprehensive review of the administration of elections nationwide. By providing the national story of the 2024 election, the EAVS offers policymakers and election stakeholders a better understanding of election trends and the challenges election officials navigate across the country,” said EAC Chairman Donald Palmer, Vice Chair Thomas Hicks, Commissioner Christy McCormick, and Commissioner Ben Hovland in a joint statement. “Without the participation of thousands of election officials reflected in the EAVS report, we would not have the detailed picture of the general election that we do. Their dedication to serving voters and incredible work throughout 2024 resulted in professionally run elections.”</span></p>

Other key findings from the 2024 EAVS include:</span></p>
<p><strong>Voter Registration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 211 million citizens were active registered voters for the 2024 general election — 86.6% of the citizen voting age population.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State motor vehicle offices and automatic voter registration were the two most used methods of voter registration. Motor vehicle offices accounted for 32.2% of transactions processed. Automatic voter registration was used for 26.4% of transactions.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">States reported sending nearly 40 million confirmation notices as part of efforts to maintain accurate voter rolls. Accurate voter list maintenance is an essential part of a well-functioning voter registration system — having accurate lists helps reduce costs, decreases wait times, and ensures that only voters eligible to vote can do so. Confirmation notices help ensure that voters are not removed in error.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Voting Methods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-person voting continued to be the most common voting method in the 2024 general election, with over 70% of voters choosing to cast their ballots in person. And 35.2% voted in person before Election Day, while 37.4% voted in person on Election Day.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting by mail decreased to about 30% of total ballots cast in the 2024 election. Despite this shift, election officials continue to implement security measures to ensure this option is secure. Mail ballots are protected by state laws that determine how they must be filled out and returned by the voter, and then verified by election officials before they are counted.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 98% of election jurisdictions used voting equipment that has voters mark a paper ballot or produces an auditable paper record of  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters’ ballot preferences. The percentage of jurisdictions that reported using voting systems without a verified paper trail has decreased significantly since the 2022 general election. In the 2024 EAVS, only 80 jurisdictions in three states reported using these systems, with just one jurisdiction reporting only using this type of voting system.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Voting Systems and Election Supporting Technology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 93% of states, the territories, and DC require voting system testing and certification either by statute or through a formal administrative rule or guidance. Some of these states require full EAC certification, while others require testing to federal standards or testing by a federally accredited laboratory.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 40% of jurisdictions used electronic poll books to assist with voting, which was the highest percentage reported to date in the EAVS. Given the rise in use, the EAC recently established a Voluntary Electronic Poll Book Certification Program to evaluate and test the security, accessibility, and usability of electronic poll books across the country.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Poll Workers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 47.9% of jurisdictions reported facing significant challenges in recruiting and retaining poll workers, recruitment has become easier since the last presidential election. More than 770,000 individuals served as poll workers for the 2024 general election, the majority of which were over 61 years old.On July 9, the EAC will host &#8220;</span><a href="https://link.mediaoutreach.meltwater.com/ls/click?upn=u001.vTI5DAfbsaYguWqsNUNBtkg1aZl7cyr7Z-2BJDP1m4xg8LBUJCD9Jtloqf7-2BLynZwlBhRRDE8MRq6m645xnbZBVJz6f17OCnkg4Cp90jN6bix1R3rL3h7EIyXM2OkfWTGTtv2wXreIIFxaloVDc0PzUw-3D-3D-_ew_C6Knsj52BCpW11NxpmMJaBKdTkM0OBFhz03xpM9h4HYR6nlGHZrI5ACZOmmT-2BaqHmreuJ-2FlsFW8KbKLKE7LrO46k6m2Lj5uepkGDGgSI0UohJgq-2FuG1JiDXq0O4N98GMNuVUXwOATW0mG-2F2X1HiYXb3RdmBmArDDvhEkawpxaNW8ySxESqHFAv92lJtSagLYD-2FmY0Jrd1bpW0mGAPPndGUt6JsLiAekV6Wj7Lp4THDobfxNHyeO8YtmZkKXVjwFQUCvbKIsePM7MtkfWx59HScN8wKE4hKYbO17lb0YcJOrIOflIvj-2BHuJKu6gCJYOucWlN4RTIMZmP0dWprG5hSo2pM5DWlN22tvXxer76l2H3-2BEQ0N1aWJygW76FNerWLy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2025 EAC Data Summit: Election Administration by the Numbers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Election Data Summit</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the release of EAVS, the EAC held an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3xG48FlAKPY?si=NAydizEjOOE1cY8G"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Data Summit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day-long summit featured </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2025-07/Data_Summit_2025_Agenda_Panelist_FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">panels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the EAVS as well as rural election administration, voter list maintenance, funding elections, workforce development and data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the opening panel, Raymond Williams, director of research, U.S. Election Assistance Commission and Lindsay Nielson and Kiersten Downs, senior researchers for Fors Marsh talked about the 2024 EAVS results, but also about the future of the EAVS and how they are working to make it better for state and local elections officials to complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are currently instituting some working groups that are looking at different sections of the EAVS to make adjustments and we’re also talking about ways we can improve the data quality of the EAVS,” Williams explained. “Whether that’s using public data elections offices are putting out and other ways where we could potentially pre-fill the data which could potentially ease the survey burden for the long haul.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Downs with Fors Marsh, there have been 15 working group sessions with 38 election officials so far and some vendors were in there as well. She noted that one of the biggest complaints about the EAVS process is that a one-size fits all survey really doesn’t fit all because there is such a variation in election administration from state to state and even locality to locality. She said that varying terminology was one particular sticking point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve made great strides on improving [the survey] based on feedback,” Downs said. “And the feedback is ongoing.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, The Brennan Center released their </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-july-2025"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2025 Local Election Officials Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The 2025 poll was <img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8681" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BrennanCenter-150x128.png" alt="" width="150" height="128" />administered online by the Brennan Center between April 15 and May 17, 2025, with 858 local election officials responding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brennan Center sent email invitations to participate in the online survey to a list of 8,491 local election officials, created with the assistance of the U.S. Vote Foundation. Data was weighted on region and jurisdiction size to ensure it represents the universe of local election officials. What follows are some of the key findings.</span></p>
<p><strong>Federal cutbacks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60% of local election officials are concerned about federal cuts to election security services.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">61% of local election officials are specifically concerned about cuts to services provided by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">87% of local election officials say it’s important for state and local government to provide additional resources to make up for cut funds and support.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background: In February, the Department of Homeland Security</span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cisa-election-security-freeze-memo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> froze</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election security services offered to local election officials by the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency. That included cutting funding for the Election Infrastructure Information Analysis Center which helped local election officials share information about threats to elections, and cutting staff that helped local election officials with physical security assessments of their offices and with bolstering cybersecurity.</span></p>
<p><strong>Interference in election administration</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">59% of local election officials are concerned about political leaders engaging in efforts to interfere with how they or fellow election officials around the country do their jobs in future elections.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">46% of local election officials are concerned about politically motivated investigations of themselves or other election officials in future elections.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Threats, harassment, and abuse</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">38% of local election officials report experiencing threats, harassment, or abuse because of their job.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">52% of local election officials are concerned about the safety of their colleagues and/or staff in future elections.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also found that 81% of local election officials are concerned about false information about elections spreading on social media in future elections.</span></p>

The department’s effort, which is still in its early stages, is not based on new evidence, data or legal authority, according to the people, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. Instead, it is driven by the unsubstantiated argument made by many in the Administration that American elections are easy prey to voter fraud and foreign manipulation, these people said. “The tactics we’re seeing out of DOJ right now are building on what we’ve seen from anti-democracy groups for years,” said Dax Goldstein, the program director of election protection at the States United Democracy Center, a nonprofit organization. “They’re rooted in the same lies about elections, and they’re all meant to create noise and fear and concerns about issues with our elections that just don’t exist. Our elections are safe and secure, and election officials are working to keep them that way.” In other DOJ news,</span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/pennsylvania/2025/07/09/justice-department-civil-rights-hava-letter-election-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the department sent a letter to Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt asking for a wide range of information on how it manages voter registration and voter rolls, as part of what it calls “nationwide efforts” to monitor compliance with a key federal voting statute. The department asked for 14 categories of information on the state’s voter registration activities, including how voters are added to and removed from the voter roll, and how the state prevents unauthorized access to its system. <em>Votebeat</em> and <em>Spotlight PA</em> obtained a copy of the letter, which was signed by Maureen Riordan, the new acting chief of the voting section in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. In a letter addressed to leaders of the </span><a href="https://statescoop.com/democrats-demand-cisa-explain-how-its-supporting-election-offices/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democratic lawmakers demanded to know why the agency hasn’t responded to their recent inquiries about the level of support it’s providing to state and local election offices. Ranking members Rep. Joseph D. Morelle and Sen. Alex Padilla wrote that they’re seeking “urgent updates” to the status of numerous election security policies and programs offered by CISA under previous administrations. The letter, which is addressed to CISA acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala and Mona Harrington, assistant director of CISA’s National Risk Management Center, demands a “comprehensive briefing” on CISA’s operations and personnel before July 21. “CISA’s repeated failure to respond to our requests for information while undertaking a significant reshaping of the agency’s personnel and mission is unacceptable,” the letter reads. “We remain deeply troubled by the lack of information CISA has provided to congressional oversight committees and the lack of substantive responses to our questions.” Citing the Supreme Court’s recent ruling curtailing nationwide injunctions, the Department of Justice (DOJ) asked a federal judge to weaken part of a previous court order against President Donald Trump’s</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/doj-trump-anti-voting-executive-order-supreme-court-nationwide-injunction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elections executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The DOJ asked District Judge Denise Casper July 3 to amend the portion of her previous court order that barred the government from enforcing Section 2d of Trump’s executive order. That section of the Trump order requires public assistance agencies to assess citizenship before providing voter registration forms to enrollees. The department argued that, to avoid running afoul of Trump v. CASA, in which SCOTUS banned universal injunctions, Casper must limit the part of her court order relating to Section 2d only to the 19 states, all Democratic-led, challenging Trump’s executive order.</span></p>

According to Votebeat, Witzel-Behl, who was put on leave by the city after the error and then resigned, broke state law by failing to supervise absentee ballot handling, neglecting post-election processes, and by not training poll workers to check the bags used to transport ballots, the commission concluded.“There is no evidence that the City Clerk took any steps to investigate the uncounted ballots once they were brought to her attention,” the commission wrote. “The evidence demonstrates that the City Clerk began her vacation on November 13 and then had little to do with the supervision of her office until almost a month later.” The draft report follows a months-long investigation into the 193 ballots that went missing on Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13046" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/RiversideCoCASeal-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Bomb Threats</strong>: On Election Day 2024,</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181834/election-day-voting-bomb-threats"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> multiple bomb threats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were called into elections offices nationwide. While </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/preparation-kept-bomb-threats-disrupting-2024-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing materialized </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from those threats, a review in Riverside County, California showed how the threats impacted that county and where there is room for improvement moving forward. A bomb threat at the county’s ballot processing facility during the November election caught workers off guard and </span><a href="https://www.pressenterprise.com/2025/07/02/bomb-threats-caused-security-breach-during-2024-election-in-riverside-county-report-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">led to a “serious security breach,” according to a civil grand jury report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> scrutinizing the county Registrar of Voters. The report, the end product of an in-depth investigation into the county’s election procedures, did not allege fraud or malfeasance in the 2024 election and praised the registrar for steps taken to improve security and ballot counting. The registrar hires hundreds of temporary workers during election season. Those workers, the jury reported, “were unaware of what to do” during the bomb threats. “Temporary workers did not know where to safely assemble, no one checked off a list of employees who evacuated the building complex to see who may be missing, and no emergency supplies were assembled to assist evacuees,” the report states, adding that “an undetermined number of temporary workers just went home one night.” Video cameras at the ballot processing center did not record evacuations during the bomb threats, reported the jury, a group of citizens empaneled by a judge to probe the inner workings of public agencies and suggest improvements, though the subjects of jury probes are not legally compelled to follow juries’ recommendations. “If someone entered the facility during the two emergency evacuations, there is no record of it,” the report read. “This is a serious security breach.” Registrar spokesperson Elizabeth Florer said the registrar will provide “a thorough response” to the jury’s security breach allegation in its official response to the report, which is due by Sept. 24. The work of an advisory panel and “investments” in the registrar’s office have “contributed to significant improvements noted in the report,” including ballot processing “and overall election security,” Florer wrote in an email to the <em>Press Enterprise</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-13045" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PierceCoWAFlag-300x192.png" alt="" width="205" height="131" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PierceCoWAFlag-300x192.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PierceCoWAFlag.png 320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px" />This Slaps!:</strong> The Pierce County, Washington elections office is contacting all voters ages 18 to 26 and asking them to </span><a href="https://www.cascadepbs.org/news/briefs/2025/06/pierce-county-auditor-asks-young-voters-to-update-their-signatures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update their signatures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an effort to head off challenges and make sure their votes are counted. In last year’s presidential election, 2,029 Pierce County ballots were flagged as “challenged” by election workers because the signature did not match the one on file. Voters aged 18 to 26 were disproportionately represented — 51% of the challenged ballots came from that age group. Voter registration in Washington happens automatically when people get their driver’s license, so for many voters, the signature they provided when they got their license at 16 is the one used for comparison when they vote. But by the time they turn 18, their signature often looks totally different, said Pierce County Auditor Linda Farmer.  “Because kids these days don’t need to sign anything,” Farmer told Cascade PBS. Farmer said technology has in some ways made signatures “a little outdated,” and that elections officials throughout the country have been looking into alternative ways to verify people’s identities. “Logistically, we’re still figuring that out and going through a few pilots, so it’ll take a while for the industry to change,” Farmer said. “But for now, signatures are a tried and tested way to tell that it’s you.” The Auditor’s Office is planning to mail postcards to young voters later this month. They’re mailing two different versions — one in standard English, and another written in “Gen-Z slang,” Farmer said.  “We’re running an experiment to see if people who get one postcard respond more at higher numbers than the other one,” Farmer said. One postcard starts with “Dear voter.” The Gen-Z one is addressed “Hey Bestie.”  “Update your signature,” the standard version says. “You can even submit multiple versions to make sure your vote always counts!”  “Fix it before it flops,” the Gen-Z version says. “Your signature isn’t ugly — it’s inconsistent. Fix it now and thank us later. It only takes like, 2 minutes.”  </span></p>

For decades, voting officials have noted that there was no national citizenship list to compare their state lists to, so to verify citizenship for their voters, they either needed to ask people to provide a birth certificate or a passport — something that could disenfranchise millions — or use a complex patchwork of disparate data sources. Elections officials and privacy advocates are expressing concern.

Strain’s winning sticker was a patriotic design that featured a bald eagle in front of the American flag, will be printed on stickers and distributed by the Board of Elections to thousands of voters during upcoming local elections. This marks the contest’s second year, which first started in 2024 as a way to promote and increase participation in local elections. The Board of Elections asked students from around Livingston County in grades 5-12 to submit their original artwork featuring the words “I voted” for the contest. “This contest has been a great way for us to engage with the younger community and promote interest in our democratic process,” said Elections Commissioner Gary Nageldinger. “We had some very impressive entries this year. I’d like to thank all the students who shared their designs and the hundreds of community members who voted in our contest. Keep an eye out for Madeline’s artwork next time you go the polls in Livingston County.” Board of Elections officials went through the many contest submissions and narrowed the entries down to their top five. Those finalists were then put to a public vote online. Madeline’s submission received an overwhelming 46.1% of the ballots cast, resulting in a clear favorite among voters.</span></p>

Carnes served as the first female director of the Belmont County Board of Elections, taking over the position in 1975. According to The Intelligencer, Carnes always expressed an affinity for the older punch card system of voting, but grew to embrace the newer voting technologies. In 1995, she became the first chairwoman of the board, succeeding her husband, former Ohio Sen. James Carnes, R-St. Clairsville. “When you hear the Carnes name in our community, you immediately think of Jim and Frankie Carnes,” said Belmont County Commissioner Vince Gianangeli. “She served the community for over 50 years on the board of elections. She always ran the office by the book, and was well respected. “Her expertise will be hard to replace. We pray for her family during this difficult time.” Belmont County Commissioner Jerry Echemann added he also appreciated Carnes’ service to the county and the board of elections. “Certainly, down through the years, we’ve been really proud of the work in general from our board of elections,” he said. “We’ve had very little problems at all during the elections. Everything is always run efficiently and fairly — and of course she would have been a very big part of that.”</span></p>

New York City used RCV for the third time in its June primaries. Key findings of the poll include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">96% of New York City voters say their ballot was simple to complete, including at least 94% of each racial group surveyed. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">76% say they want to keep or expand RCV, with 42% wanting to expand it to general elections and 34% wanting to keep it for primaries. Only 17% say RCV should not be used for municipal elections. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">81% say they understand RCV extremely or very well, with another 16% saying they understand it somewhat well and only 3% saying they do not understand it well. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">82% say they ranked two or more candidates for mayor, with 45% reporting that they ranked five.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among voters who ranked 2 or more candidates, 58% say “ranking allowed me to vote for candidates who aligned with my values.” Among voters who ranked only one, 87% say “that was the only candidate I liked.” </span></li>

It can also be an opportunity: as threats to democratic institutions and values build in the U.S. and around the world, it is vital to outline strategies that can reignite young people’s connections to institutions and understanding of their civic power ahead of the 2026 elections and beyond. CIRCLE’s new data on youth trust in institutions paints a complicated picture of youth distrust, how it relates to civic action, and what we can learn from it to inform future efforts. CIRCLE’s recent report,</span><a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/report-genz-attitudes-democracy"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How Does Gen Z Really Feel About Democracy?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, published in partnership with the nonpartisan nonprofit Protect Democracy, highlighted the precarious relationship between trust in institutions and young people’s civic development. One major finding: the most civically engaged young people, who we say show a Hostile Dissatisfaction toward democracy, tend to be less trusting of institutions. This aligns with past CIRCLE research, that highlights a connection between young people who are paying attention to and engaging with institutions and a certain degree of cynicism and disillusionment. Research also found that only 16% of 18- to 29-year-olds believe democracy is working well for young people.</span></p>

The proposed 15-member task force would be appointed by leadership from both chambers of Congress. It would hold hearings, work with territorial governments, and deliver a report within a year detailing the barriers residents face in gaining full and equal representation. The bill builds on provisions from the “For the People Act” introduced in previous congressional sessions by House democrats in 116th and 117th Congresses. More than 3.5 million U.S. citizens living in the territories cannot vote for president and lack full voting representation in Congress. Plaskett announced the legislation on July 3, highlighting the territory’s long history of fighting for equal rights. “Today, on Emancipation Day in the U.S. Virgin Islands, we take a critical step toward addressing one of the most glaring inequities in our democracy,” Plaskett said. “The timing of this announcement honors the historic significance of July 3, 1848, when enslaved people in the Danish West Indies—now the U.S. Virgin Islands — gained their freedom, marking a pivotal moment in the fight for equal rights and representation.” Moylan said the lack of voting rights is especially troubling given the number of residents from the territories who serve in the military.</span></p>

Katie Hobbs (D) </span><a href="https://www.kawc.org/news/2025-07-02/az-gov-hobbs-vetoes-bill-that-would-release-faster-election-results"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to help Arizona expedite results. The governor said she could not accept a provision she said could penalize some voters who wait until the last minute to cast their ballots. Her rejection of SB 1001 was in the last batch of bills sent to her before the Legislature adjourned for the year on June 27. SB1001 still would have allowed ballot drop-offs &#8212; but with the option of on-site verification. That would mean getting photo identification from those dropping off their ballots after Friday night, a move that would eliminate the need for the kind of signature verification of &#8220;late-early ballots&#8221; that otherwise could not start until days after Election Day. The legislation still would allow people to simply drop a ballot and leave. And those ballots still would be counted. But there was a price of sorts to be paid for forcing that after-election signature verification: That voter would be removed from the &#8220;active early voting list,&#8221; meaning they would not automatically get another ballot by mail ahead of the next election. Hobbs pronounced that a non-starter. She said there are voters who depend on family members or caregivers to drop off their early ballots, meaning they could not appear in person to have their identification checked. And that, said the governor, presents them with the choice of either losing the option to complete their ballots on Election Day &#8212; an option that exists for everyone else &#8212; or being removed from that active early voter list. &#8220;I&#8217;m certain that we all agree that every eligible vote should count, and no American should be deprived of this right,&#8221; Hobbs wrote.</span></p>

Telo Taitague held a public hearing on her Bill 154-38 that would require </span><a href="https://www.postguam.com/news/local/bill-seeks-to-comply-with-trump-executive-order-on-fair-elections/article_35c7edce-f6f8-422e-99dc-4cda21f8ec62.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;documentary proof of United States citizenship to align Guam voter registration practices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with federal election integrity standards.&#8221; &#8220;At the heart of this bill is a simple principle: voting in U.S. elections is a right reserved for U.S. citizens. While Guam law currently requires voter applications to declare their citizenship under penalty of perjury, it does not require actual proof of that citizenship,&#8221; Taitague said. Taitague chairs the Committee on Economic Investment, Military Buildup, Regional Relations, Regulatory Affairs, Technology, Justice, Elections and Retirement. Guam Election Commission Executive Director Maria Pangelinan testified that the GEC supports reinstating documentation requirements. &#8220;Historically, Guam law required documentary proof of citizenship. This was later removed in 2015 to streamline registration, allowing applicants to self-declare under penalty of perjury,&#8221; Pangelinan said. &#8220;Effectively, Bill 154-38 provides a structured approach to, one, ensure that voter eligibility is clearly established. Two, provide a uniform, fair, and enforceable standard for all registrants. And three, reflect best practices for election security and legal compliance,&#8221; she added  Bill 154 would require voter applicants to submit documentary proof of U.S. citizenship, such as a U.S. passport, Certificate of U.S. Citizenship, or Certificate of Naturalization, along with a valid government-issued photo identification, Taitague said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6763" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MICap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Michigan:</strong> Clerks from across the state spoke up before the House Election Integrity Committee, offering their support for a piece of legislation aimed at preserving their say in </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2025/07/01/michigan-clerks-speak-up-in-support-of-bill-to-preserve-local-authority-over-voting-machine-testing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pre-election testing of voting machines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Committee Chair Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), a former clerk, told her colleagues that for years, local clerks have successfully conducted logic and accuracy testing of their machines by working with vendors of their choosing. However, Smit raised concerns that a recent contract acquired by the Michigan Secretary of State could require clerks to use only their contracted vendor to generate test decks.  “This represents a fundamental shift from our local control to state mandated centralization, a shift that raises concerns about the integrity, transparency and fiscal responsibility. The bill before us today provides very clear, common sense protections that preserve local autonomy while ensuring proper standards. Specifically it protects local choice,” Smit said. Smit’s</span><a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Bills/Bill?ObjectName=2025-HB-4602"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 4602</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states that the Secretary of State cannot bar or restrict local clerks from using any lawful source for creating testing materials. “Our local clerks are directly accountable to their communities. This legislation ensures that they retain the tools and autonomy necessary to fulfill that responsibility. When problems arise, clerks need direct control over the processes and relationships with their vendors,” Smit said, later emphasizing that local jurisdictions operate under tight budgets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Republicans introduced a bill to ban </span><a href="https://www.wilx.com/2025/07/03/state-republicans-introduce-bill-ban-ranked-choice-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked-choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan.

Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex/Mercer/Somerset/Hunterdon), which would amend the law concerning </span><a href="https://www.tapinto.net/towns/hillsborough/articles/zwicker-bill-to-update-election-auditing-process-clears-committee"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post-election audits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under the bill, S-3853, these changes would include permitting post-election audits to be conducted by independent third-party electronic machines that are not in any way associated with the official ballot tabulation system for the election, in addition to a hand-to-eye count. Under current law, post-election audits are conducted exclusively through hand-to-eye counts of voter-verifiable paper records. The bill would also eliminate certain requirements for audit procedures designed, adopted, and implemented by the audit team to ensure a certain percentage of statistical power that a 100 percent manual recount of the voter-verifiable paper records would not alter the electoral outcome reported by the audit. Instead, post-election audit procedures will be published before elections and subject to public comment.</span></p>

The proposed changes were unveiled in a bill approved by the House Elections Law Committee June 26. Changes the bill proposes would prohibit state and local election board members from encouraging voting and open a way for foreign nationals to contribute to referendum campaigns. Another provision would require members of the military and citizens voting from other countries to provide photo ID or sign a document saying why they couldn’t send one. State Elections Director Sam Hayes told the House Elections Committee that</span><a href="https://webservices.ncleg.gov/ViewDocSiteFile/100446"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 958</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would allow him to reorganize the office the way he wants. “These positions would just allow me the flexibility that I need to conduct that reorganization and make sure that folks that are surrounding me, certainly my direct reports and I, are aligned on the vision for the agency as I set forward,” he said. “But I want to assure everybody today that we are going to do this in a nonpartisan fashion.” Democrats on the committee objected to having the main office overseeing elections convert 25 jobs to those where employees are hired and fired based on their politics. The bill would also authorize a new signature verification pilot program for citizens voting by mail. The legislature mandated the first one in 2023. The bill also includes provisions that would prevent state and local election board members from making public statements promoting voter turnout. </span></p>

If it passes, it will require Ohioans registering to vote or updating their registration to also provide proof of citizenship. The bill states current or expired driver&#8217;s license, passports, birth certificates or naturalization forms would all be accepted. If the person has had a name change, they would have to show proof of that change. The bill would also change zoning laws for county elections and ban drop boxes. SB153 remains in Senate committee for discussion and approval. It must pass the state Senate and House before moving to Gov. Mike DeWine&#8217;s desk for consideration.</span></p>

The agreement says voters who face removal should be notified two additional times before they are taken off the list, and once afterward. The agreement does not appear to impose any new notification requirements on county recorders, who manage county voter rolls. What it would do is provide suggested best practices for how the recorders should implement the law, including the schedule of notices. Because the additional notices wouldn’t be required, voters across the state could face unequal treatment as recorders begin implementing the law for the first time in 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican National Committee (RNC) and Arizona GOP have filed a lawsuit seeking to block an Arizona law that allows </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5377332-gop-sues-arizona-overseas-voting-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">military and other temporarily absent overseas voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cast ballots without providing proof of citizenship directly to the state. The Arizona law, adopted in 2023, allows some overseas U.S. citizens who have not lived in the Grand Canyon State but have a parent who is a registered Arizona voter to cast ballots through a federal write-in system created under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) of 1986. The Arizona election law was reviewed by the Supreme Court last August, when justices sided with the RNC and Arizona GOP leaders’ argument that proof of citizenship should be required for state voter registration forms. But the high court also upheld the portion of the law that allows overseas voters to cast ballots by mail without confirming citizenship to the state if they meet other federal registration requirements.</span></p>

The DA’s Office alleges that in July 2022, Powell registered to vote at an address in the City of Arroyo Grande where she did not live, thereby committing voter registration fraud. Instead, prosecutors say she lived in a rural part of the county outside of the city limits. Also during the 2022 election cycle, she’s accused of falsely declaring under penalty of perjury the location of her residence, submitting false nomination papers, failing to file campaign finance reports as required by law, and voting on November 8, 2022, where she was not legally entitled to vote.

This is to prevent the intimidation of voters while they are at a polling place. A warrant was issued for Mora by authorities for illegal electioneering. On July 4, Mora was found riding his bike in Live Oak and was taken into custody by the Sutter County Sheriff&#8217;s Office without incident.</span></p>

Peters is serving a nine-year prison sentence for her role in a 2021 security breach in the elections office she oversaw. Peters has appealed the conviction. While the Colorado Court of Appeals reviews her appeal, Peters has filed a federal habeas corpus petition in U.S. District Court of Colorado, arguing that she should be released on bond pending the appeal decision. The hearing, scheduled for July 22, is set to focus on the habeas corpus petition, in which Peters’ attorneys say that “since she has been incarcerated, her health has deteriorated.” Peters’ attorneys said in the motion that she wanted to attend the July 22 hearing because the issues being discussed “affect her liberty interests.” Varholak’s decision precludes her from doing so. </span></p>

Last fall, Fulton County election board member Julie Adams, a Republican who refused to certify the results in her county’s presidential preference primary, filed a lawsuit against Fulton County, arguing that board members have the option to refuse to certify election results if they have reason to believe they are inaccurate. A spate of last-minute rule changes issued by the State Election Board would also have granted county boards greater leeway to delay certifying election results, but were later struck down by a Superior Court judge. In October, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney rejected her claim, issuing a ruling that stated “election superintendents in Georgia have a mandatory fixed obligation to certify election results.” In a</span><a href="https://efast.gaappeals.us/download?filingId=806099f5-e70f-45db-9709-39ff432deb27"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued July 2, a three-judge panel agreed. “Adams’ contention that the trial court erred by declaring she had a mandatory duty to certify election results is without merit,” the judges wrote in their decision. They also concluded that while election officials have certain forms of recourse if they believe there are errors in the election counts, “these concerns are not a basis for a superintendent to partially or entirely refuse to certify election results by the deadline.”</span></p>

In addition to Jefferson County, Barren, Boyle, Calloway, Campbell, Daviess, Edmonson, Jessamine, Lincoln, Metcalf, Trigg and Warren counties were also selected.</span></p>

Dennis was indicted on three counts of wrongful registration, a felony, and three counts of perjury, a misdemeanor. Dennis, who was found guilty of sexual misconduct in 1993, according to court records, was a felon who attempted to register to vote three times in 2006, 2018 and 2020, respectively, according to the court’s indictment. Those attempts also landed him the perjury charges for attempting to mislead county officials by falsifying his voting record.</span></p>

Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the move to order more arguments and said the court should have decided the case. The move means the state&#8217;s map with two majority-Black districts remains intact for now. The district lines at the center of the dispute were invalidated in 2022 by a three-judge lower court panel, which sided with a group of self-described &#8220;non-African-American voters&#8221; who had challenged the House map as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The map wasn&#8217;t the first crafted by the state&#8217;s Republican-led legislature in the wake of the 2020 Census. Instead, Louisiana&#8217;s efforts to redraw district lines, as all states do after the census, have resulted in a yearslong legal battle that has been before the Supreme Court twice before.</span></p>

Williams entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Laura Provinzino in St. Paul. Court records don&#8217;t say whether there was a formal plea agreement. Williams&#8217; co-defendant, Lorraine Lee Combs, 57, pleaded guilty June 24. Under her plea agreement, the prosecution and defense agreed that the nonbinding federal sentencing guidelines recommend a sentence of zero to six months in prison, with one to three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $20,000. The actual sentences will be determined by the judge. The charges carry statutory maximums of five years in prison. Sentencing dates have not been set. Both defendants will remain free in the meantime. Williams and Combs allegedly generated fictitious names and other data they used to fill out Minnesota voter registration forms in 2021 and 2022. The charging documents filed last month say Williams provided the completed forms to an entity that sought to register voters in Minnesota that is identified only as “Foundation 1,” which paid him, and that he then split the proceeds with Combs.</span></p>

According to The Associated Press, the case has drawn national interest because of a 2-1 ruling issued in May by a three-judge panel of the 8th Circuitthat erased a path through the federal Voting Rights Act for people in seven states to sue under a key provision of the landmark federal civil rights law. The tribes argued that the 2021 map violated the act by diluting their voting strength and ability to elect their own candidates. The panel said only the U.S. Department of Justice can bring such lawsuits. That followed a 2023 ruling out of Arkansas in the same circuit that also said private individuals can’t sue under Section 2 of the law. After the May decision, the Spirit Lake Tribe and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians asked the appeals court for a rehearing before all 11 judges. Attorneys general of 19 states, numerous former U.S. Justice Department attorneys, several voting rights historians and others also asked for a rehearing. But in a ruling July 3, the full court denied the request, which was filed by the Native American Rights Fund and other groups representing the tribes. Three judges said they would have granted it, including Circuit Chief Judge Steven Colloton, who had dissented in the previous ruling. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 9, the Campaign Legal Center said it </span><a href="https://www.thedickinsonpress.com/news/north-dakota/north-dakota-tribes-to-take-voting-disenfranchisement-lawsuit-to-us-supreme-court"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will ask the U.S. Supreme Court  to review </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">an Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling. </span></p>

The Oklahoma Supreme Court heard oral arguments on June 24 about State Question 836. SQ 836 proposes that all registered voters in Oklahoma would vote in one primary election. All voters would get the same ballot with candidates from all parties on it. From there, the two candidates with the most votes would move onto the general election. This proposal was announced shortly after the general election last year. The open primary petition delivers voters. The fastest growing group of voters in Oklahoma. The nearly 500,000 taxpayers registered as Independents. Independents have been systematically excluded from voting in closed primaries and we need to fix that and this petition does it,&#8221; Oklahoma United CEO Margaret Kobos said when the proposal was announced. Now, the state question is being challenged in court by the Oklahoma Republican Party, as many state Republicans have been vocal about not wanting an open primary system. The lawsuit argues the SQ 836 is unconstitutional.</span></p>

Sentencing for Md Munsur Ali, 48, of Millbourne came about a week after Bartle sentenced his two co-conspirators to federal prison. In addition to 21 months behind bars, Bartle ordered Ali to serve a year of supervised release and pay a $2,500 special assessment. Ali, who remains a member of Millbourne Council, pleaded guilty in April to 25 charges against him — one count of conspiracy, 12 counts of giving false information in registering to vote, and 12 counts of fraudulent voter registration. According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Philadelphia, Ali and co-conspirators Md Nurul Hasan, 48, and Md Rafikul Islam, 52, also of Millbourne, agreed to fraudulently submit write-in votes to elect Hasan mayor, after he was knocked out of contention in the 2021 Democratic primary election. Hasan and Islam also pleaded guilty in April.</span></p>

The indictments add to six previous ones revealed by Paxton in May. The others charged include the former mayors of Pearsall and Dilley and other local elected officials from those cities and Frio County, according to KSAT. According to the Texas Tribune, the investigation and indictments targeted Latino Democrats in the state. At the time, Latino leaders in Texas condemned the moves while Democratic state lawmakers asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the state for potential violations of federal law and civil and voting rights amid a flurry of what Republican state leaders described as efforts to secure the state’s elections.Neither Paxton’s office nor 81st Judicial District Attorney Audrey Gossett Louis returned requests for comment. </span></p>

Giles is accused of providing false information on his application and petition to run for the Randall County Republican Party Chair seat in December 2023 for a spot on the 2024 primary ballot, according to the grand jury indictment signed late last month. It is unclear what about his application or petition was considered fraudulent. The offense is typically classified as a misdemeanor, but because Giles is accused of doing it while serving as an elected official, it becomes a felony. Giles did not respond to a request for comment, nor did anyone else with the Randall County Republican Party.</span></p>

The petition for removal was initiated by Electoral Board Chair Atoy Carrington and Registrar Stephanie Iles. In a hearing before the State Board of Elections in January, both officials pleaded for intervention, with Iles describing the situation in Norfolk&#8217;s election office as &#8220;toxic&#8221; and expressing concern in an email that future elections would be in jeopardy if McKay was not removed. Carrington begged the state board for help. McKay, a Republican appointee to the board, was accused of a series of actions, including seeking to withdraw her certification of the 2024 general election results and using her training to train poll workers through a group called The Election Integrity Committee, which accusers argued was a political activity while performing official duties. The Republican-leaning State Board of Elections voted 4 to 1 to refer the case to Norfolk&#8217;s Commonwealth&#8217;s Attorney, Ramin Fatehi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circuit Court Judge Randall Smith has </span><a href="https://www.whro.org/elections/2025-07-01/virginia-beach-judge-voids-district-voting-system-focus-shifts-to-referendum-vote"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voided the district-based local election system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implemented by the federal courts in 2021. Smith ruled the city acted illegally when it adopted an ordinance in 2023 to codify the 10-1 district system without a corresponding charter change. The 10-district system was in effect for the 2022 and 2024 elections. The results of those elections stand based on the Smith’s ruling this week. The ruling doesn’t immediately offer any way to resolve the conflicting requirements. Any city charter changes in Virginia must be approved by the General Assembly. A change to enshrine Virginia Beach’s district system was approved by Virginia’s House of Delegates and Senate in 2024, but Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed the bill. An upcoming voter referendum authorized by the city council may help resolve the matter. Residents will vote in November on whether they want the 10-district system or restore three at-large council seats.</span></p>

The latest lawsuit brought by a bipartisan coalition of business leaders was filed in Dane County circuit court, rather than directly with the state Supreme Court as the rejected cases were. The justices did not give any reason for declining to hear those cases, but typically lawsuits start in a lower court and work their way up. This new lawsuit&#8217;s more lengthy journey through the courts might not be resolved in time to order new maps before the 2026 midterms. The Wisconsin Business Leaders for Democracy argue in the new lawsuit that Wisconsin’s congressional maps are unconstitutional because they are an anti-competitive gerrymander. The lawsuit notes that the median margin of victory for candidates in the eight districts since the maps were enacted is close to 30 percentage points.</span></p>

The law will also require someone registering to vote to attest that they’ve lived in Wyoming for at least 30 days. Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group, filed a lawsuit in May, alleging the new law will impose an undue burden on the right to vote and is unconstitutionally vague as written. The group has asked the court to prevent the law from going into effect while the case plays out.  High-profile attorneys — who have fought for and against President Trump on the national stage — have since flocked to both sides of the case. Plus, a coalition of 25 states and Guam filed a proposed</span><a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/6_27_25-proposed-amicus-brief.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Friday, urging the court to allow the law to go into effect.  “Wyoming follows four other states — Arizona, Kansas, Georgia, and Alabama — that have taken similar steps to ensure that only United States citizens are registered to vote,” the brief states, before accusing the plaintiff of seeking to “thwart democracy in the name of democracy.”  As for the Republican National Committee, “when a state’s election laws are challenged in federal court, political parties should be granted intervention to protect their unique interests,” the group</span><a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/6_26_25-RNC-motion-to-intervene.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> argued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its motion to intervene.  If the court grants the request, the RNC would become a defendant in the case alongside Secretary of State Chuck Gray and the state’s 23 county clerks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys for Secretary of State Chuck Gray asked a federal court June 27 to </span><a href="https://wyofile.com/gray-asks-court-to-toss-case-challenging-wyomings-new-voter-registration-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismiss a lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">against Wyoming’s new voter registration law, arguing in two filings that the complaint does not sufficiently demonstrate how the new requirements could harm potential voters. Proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship will be required to register to vote in Wyoming under the new law. The law also requires someone registering to vote to attest that they’ve lived in the state for at least 30 days.  Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group made up of several nonprofits, filed a lawsuit in May after the Wyoming Legislature passed House Bill 156, “Proof of voter residency-registration qualifications”.  The complaint alleges the new law is unconstitutionally vague as written and will impose an undue burden on the right to vote — particularly for women as well as Hispanic, young and low-income voters. The harms described in the complaint, however, are speculative and lack the kind of specificity required to have standing in a federal court, Gray’s attorneys argued in court filings.</span></p>
