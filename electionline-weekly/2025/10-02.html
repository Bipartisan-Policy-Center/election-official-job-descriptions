														<p><strong>Real Partnerships, Real Impact </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Researcher-Practitioner Collaboration Is Strengthening U.S. Elections</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Ashley Quarcoo, executive director </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><a href="https://www.electioninitiative.org/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Election Trust Initiative</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the face of new and enduring challenges—from underfunding to security threats to workforce shortages—election officials are constantly looking for ways to maximize their limited resources and bandwidth to best serve their voters. To make sound <img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9615" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Election-Trust-Initiative-logo-color-300x68.png" alt="" width="300" height="68" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Election-Trust-Initiative-logo-color-300x68.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Election-Trust-Initiative-logo-color-1024x232.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Election-Trust-Initiative-logo-color-768x174.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Election-Trust-Initiative-logo-color-1536x348.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Election-Trust-Initiative-logo-color-2048x464.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />decisions in this complex environment—and justify those decisions to policymakers and budget authorities—election officials are eager for actionable insights and trustworthy evidence that can guide their work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news? Across the country, a powerful trend is emerging: researchers and election officials are building relationships, co-creating shared research agendas, teaming up on projects that identify issues and test interventions, and disseminating findings and guidance to help solve these real-world problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Contra Costa County, California. Facing stretched outreach budgets, election officials needed to know what kind of messaging would bolster voter trust. Partnering with UC San Diego and UC Davis, they tested real videos and graphics—like the</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je-vdcA2pHY"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “We Checked it 4 Times” campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—and used those results to make smarter, more effective outreach decisions for the fast-approaching election cycle. The Contra-Costa study</span><a href="https://yankelovichcenter.ucsd.edu/_files/briefs/Results-that-Matter_Can-informational-videos-increase-trust-in-elections.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> built on prior research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and is now feeding a broader body of knowledge around effective voter communication practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t a unique success story. A growing number of authentic, sustained research-practitioner partnerships—ones that are grounded in trust, draw on the expertise of all participants, and address discrete, practical questions—have formed as part of a longer-term effort to build a nonpartisan evidence-base that can drive progress across current and emerging challenges facing the field.  </span></p>
<p><strong>The Big Picture</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too often, research is out of sync with the needs of practitioners. Research can be slow, while practitioner priorities can shift quickly in a changing policy and operating environment. And busy administrators don’t always have time to sift through academic papers for solutions. Without adequate translation of academic findings, the gap between insight and application can loom large for election administrators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when researchers and practitioners join forces with intention and urgency to identify discrete areas where research can drive better decisions, they can create useful tools, insights, and strategies that strengthen the system from the ground up. </span></p>
<p><strong>Why These Partnerships Matter</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best collaborations are more than quick consults—they’re ongoing and sustained relationships where practitioners generate and shape research questions, researchers draw from and add to the overall knowledge base of the field, and together they create results that matter on the ground.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These partnerships help: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diagnose system-wide challenges, such as staffing shortages or funding models</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Validate emergent election practices, like multi-media voter education campaigns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide context for and inform policymaking, such as offering comparisons of voter registration and list maintenance practices</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support the field-wide scaling of best practices, like risk-limiting audits or polling place design</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At their best, they help translate findings into usable formats: primers for officials, curriculum guides for training, white papers for lawmakers, and actionable policy recommendations for advocates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the heart of it all? Mutual respect, trust, and flexibility.</span></p>
<p><strong>What This Collaboration Looks Like</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials and researchers in several states have successfully forged such partnerships. For example, prior to the 2024 presidential primary, the Maryland State Board of Elections engaged the University of Maryland to help recruit temporary election workers to fill gaps in some counties. Working together, they quickly designed a series of pilot projects that filled key positions while also testing</span><a href="https://cdce.substack.com/p/choosing-to-strengthen-the-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research-driven strategies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from other sectors. They successfully met their recruitment goals and studied the effectiveness of applicant-centric messaging and streamlined job ads, without adding pressure or extra work for local jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in New Mexico, the Secretary of State’s office and county clerks have partnered with the University of New Mexico and Florida State University for nearly two decades on</span><a href="https://www.sos.nm.gov/2024/04/30/new-mexico-election-study-reveals-key-insights-on-voting-patterns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> biennial studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that draw on voter registration data, local election observations, and surveys of voters and poll workers to evaluate and inform practice and policy. These studies have provided insights that informed the state-wide transition to vote centers, improvements to poll worker training and staffing assignments, and the expanded use of privacy sleeves for mail-in voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, in response to nationwide concerns about long lines at the polls in 2012, the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project and the Bipartisan Policy Center partnered with election officials in Florida, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and Virginia to assess wait times and inform decision-making on resource allocation. The resulting</span><a href="https://web.mit.edu/vtp/Managing%20Polling%20Place%20Resources.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> insights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included information on where and how long wait times arose, assessments of “lost votes” and decreased confidence in elections, and models of best practices used in some localities. The partnership led to the creation of protocols that election officials could use to gather data, diagnose congestion, plan for polling place setup and staffing, and advocate for additional resources to tackle the problem.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This kind of responsive, research-informed policy and practice change is only possible through close, sustained partnership, often enabled by the shared locality of the researchers and election practitioners and amplified by non-profit partners who also support dissemination and implementation of research findings. As these partnerships deepen over time, new research needs and opportunities can organically emerge.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Election Trust Initiative’s Role in Accelerating Progress</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the</span><a href="https://www.electioninitiative.org/en/grants"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Election Trust Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we support and connect the nonpartisan actors that power U.S. elections, including officials, researchers, policymakers, and nonprofits. Our goal is simple: to build a resilient, responsive election system rooted in evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, we are pleased to announce the expansion of our investments in university-practitioner partnerships focused on solving important election administration challenges facing officials across the country. We’ve made these selections intentionally; they represent the richness and diversity of topics and localities that make elections such a unique, multi-disciplinary field. </span></p>
<p><strong>Long-Term Collaborations</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With our support, two universities will establish new initiatives to engage in sustained partnerships with practitioners across the election administration system on critical issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California San Diego’s Center for Transparent and Trusted Elections will tackle voter confidence by testing effective trust-building strategies—from audits to community messengers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Maryland’s Election Resilience Lab will address workforce issues and broader challenges to help strengthen the capacity of election agencies.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Targeted, Short-Term Projects</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we are supporting four shorter-term projects to accelerate specific topical and regional partnerships: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arkansas State University will examine how election administration varies across the urban-rural spectrum.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rutgers University will identify and validate research priorities to improve voting access for people with disabilities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Missouri–St. Louis will study how voters and administrators experience vote centers in the increasing number of states that allow them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Wisconsin-Madison will examine regional issues, like same-day registration and hyper-local administration, and national studies on poll workers and voter wait times.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we continue to support MIT’s Election Data and Science Lab, which is translating existing election administration research into digestible field resources to support implementation of evidence-based policies and practices and leading a national consultation on pressing and emergent election administration research needs, such as voter list maintenance practices.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Road Ahead</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These partnerships—and the nonpartisan research they produce—are helping local leaders make smarter decisions today while preparing the system for tomorrow. The Election Trust Initiative is proud to help catalyze these efforts and the collaborations across election officials, non-profits, researchers, and policymakers to apply relevant data and empirical evidence to their work. We hope that these projects, and others like them, inspire and support the entire field, encouraging more researchers to co-design projects with election officials that can surface actionable insights and expanding the number of election officials and other practitioners leveraging research findings and forging new collaborations. Ultimately, these sustained partnerships—anchored in respect, trust, and accountability—can help ensure America’s elections systems are secure, transparent, accurate, and convenient, and effectively serve voters and our country.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week </h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8734" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Aloha-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Statewide Audit</strong>: Concerns about differences in voting counts between a county and the state in last year’s election prompted the Hawaiʻi Elections Commission to </span><a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2025/10/elections-commission-wants-state-auditor-to-examine-hawai%CA%BBis-2024-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call for statewide audit of the elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The commission initially voted 9-0 to ask the Legislature to direct the Hawaiʻi Office of the Auditor to audit only Kauaʻi County’s general election. It was based on a recent investigation of the vote that found the state Office of Elections reported a vote count that was significantly higher than the number of ballots recorded by county officials. But the commission, at the recommendation of commissioners Lindsay Kamm and Ralph Cushnie, subsequently moved to expand the scope of the audit to the entire state. Commission Chair Mike Curtis and John Sabas, one of two new commissioners, abstained from the vote. The commission also voted to ask the Legislature to consider returning Hawaiʻi to one-day, in-person voting, and narrowly rejected a proposal to fire the chief election officer, Scott Nago. According to Honolulu Civil Beat, in terms of the requested audit, it’s unclear what comes next. The Legislature, which has authority over the state auditor, is not in session until January. And preparations for the 2026 election, including an Aug. 8 primary, are already underway. But even Nago agreed that it would be better to have the audit conducted by the state auditor rather than have the Office of Elections solicit requests for information and proposals to contract with an outside vendor.</span></p>

The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20501-20511) created a single federal form that all states are required to accept and use for voter registration for federal elections. The EAC is responsible for maintaining and, as necessary, amending this form. The NVRA mandates that states “accept and use the mail voter registration application form prescribed by the [EAC] . . . for the registration of voters in elections for Federal office”; that the form contain the following question: “Are you a citizen of the United States of America?”; and that the form “include a statement that . . . specifies each eligibility requirement (including citizenship)” and “requires the signature of the applicant, under penalty of perjury.” The NVRA also empowers the EAC to “require . . . information . . . necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant and to administer voter registration and other parts of the election process.” The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requires that the NVRA form include a question about citizenship status, requiring attestation of United States citizenship under penalty of perjury, without necessitating documentary proof of citizenship (52 U.S.C. 21083(b)(4)(A)). The implementing regulations for this requirement are provided in 11 CFR 9428.4. The petition submitted by America First Legal Foundation seeks to initiate a rulemaking process to amend 11 CFR 9428.4 and the federal voter registration form to require applicants to provide one of the following as proof of citizenship: U.S. Passport, State-issued Real ID-compliant driver&#8217;s license indicating that the applicant is a citizen, an official military identification card that indicates the applicant is a citizen of the United States, or a valid Federal or State government-issued photo identification if such identification indicates that the applicant is a United States citizen or if such identification is otherwise accompanied by proof of United States citizenship. The EAC seeks comments on the petition. Deadline: All comments are due by October 20. </span></p>

Designing an accessible PDF form requires planning, technical skill, and a solid understanding of accessibility. Many of the elements that make a form usable with assistive technology are hidden “under the hood.”  Features like tooltips (the description of the form element that a screen reader announces) and reading order (the sequence in which content is read by assistive technology) are not apparent to sighted users, but they’re essential for accessibility. Building these forms also requires the right tools, such as Adobe InDesign and Acrobat, and clear technical guidance. While there’s plenty of information available on using InDesign and on accessibility in general, there’s little that brings the two together in a resource for making accessible PDF forms in a way that’s easy to follow.  We created this new toolkit to fill that gap.</span></p>

Based on CIRCLE’s analysis of voter file data aggregated by Catalist, 42% of rural youth, ages 18-29, voted in the 2024 presidential election, 5 percentage points lower than the 47% of urban/suburban youth who cast a ballot. In 2020, we estimated that 44% of rural youth, and 52% of urban/suburban youth: an 8-point difference. This shrinking gap is a notable accomplishment for rural youth and for the many organizations and stakeholders that have worked tirelessly to support and encourage their political engagement.</span></p>

Katie Hobbs and Attorney General Kris Mayes for their review and approval, defying GOP lawmakers who say they will sue over rules they say violate state law. The Election Procedures Manual, which must be revised and approved every two years, has undergone changes after previous Republican lawsuits challenged provisions in it. Some of those changes included deleted examples of what constitutes voter intimidation and deleting a paragraph saying that the secretary of state could finalize the state’s election results without a particular county’s results if the officials missed the state deadline. “Every voter, in every corner of Arizona, should have the same fair and secure election process,” Fontes said in a statement about the submission. “The EPM makes that possible.” The manual also aims to try to alleviate ballot printing errors that have plagued election officials in recent years. Both Hobbs and Mayes must sign off on the EPM by December for it to take effect. The Secretary of State’s Office in a press release Wednesday said that 79 stakeholders submitted nearly 800 comments on the EPM. Some of the public comments include conspiracy theories and a large number of them appear to be copy and pasted from a document created by conservative activist group EZAZ.  “This manual reflects bipartisan input, public transparency, and a deep commitment to the rule of law,” Fontes said. “It helps ensure that every Arizonan’s vote is counted accurately and fairly — no matter their zip code.”</span></p>

Rep. Felicia Robinson, D-Miami Gardens, has sponsored similar legislation over the past several sessions. None have received a committee hearing (Broward County Democrat Tina Polsky has filed similar legislation in the Senate in previous years). Robinson’s legislation calls for the Florida Commission on Offender Review to develop and maintain a database of information for those with felony convictions including: The remaining length of any term of supervision. The remaining amount of any restitution owed to a victim as ordered by a court as part of his or her sentence. The remaining amount due of any fines and fees initially ordered by a court as part of his or her sentence or as a condition of any form of supervision. If the measure were to become law, the Department of State, the Department of Corrections, the clerks of the circuit courts, the county comptrollers, and the Board of Executive Clemency would provide the information listed above to the commission. That body would be required to provide the governor, president of the Senate, and speaker of the House a comprehensive plan by July 1, 2027, that would: List government entities and methods by which the commission would collect, centralize, analyze, and secure the information required to be included in the database. Describe any infrastructure and services, including but not limited to, software, hardware, and information technology services, that may be necessary to create and maintain the database. List the anticipated number of additional employees to develop and maintain the database. Estimate the cost of the database. Cite any legal authority necessary for the commission to develop and maintain the database.</span></p>

Guam Election Commission executive director Maria Pangelinan was the lone person to testify.  She said the election manual, originally created in 2015, has been reviewed and updated to strengthen and clarify the administration of the electoral process. &#8220;The proposed legislation ensures that GEC has ample time to implement these updates in its training materials as it prepares for the 2026 elections,&#8221; Pangelinan said. The election commission members met in April and proposed several changes to provisions in the more than 70-page manual. They were sent to the governor&#8217;s office and the Office of the Attorney General, and subsequently approved. Pangelinan testified about the proposed amendments, most of which were technical in nature, such as extending various deadlines. For example, the GEC sought to change the last day to register to vote from 15 days to 10 days before an election to give prospective voters an extra five days, and would also make it consistent with the election code.</span></p>

Jason Woolford, would tweak the law to require candidates for local school boards to declare a party affiliation. That requirement could force the races to have primary elections in August, in addition to the November general election when school board seats are typically voted on, officials said. Michigan clerks warn that the bill could create a range of problems for local election offices, including longer ballots, voter confusion, and thousands of extra dollars in expenses. For one thing, it would require changing the layout of primary ballots to include school board candidates in the partisan section, which could be confusing for voters and expensive to implement, Hillsdale County Clerk Abe Dane told Votebeat.</span></p>

The Justice Department has reached out to more than half the states in recent months for voter lists, and has indicated it plans to contact all of them. Some of the requests vary in detail, but in general they ask for voter information on millions of Americans, including personal data such as driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. Some states have released only publicly available data or invited DOJ attorneys to make public records requests. Others have refused outright. Indiana last week became the first known state to have provided sensitive personal data. The</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-six-states-failure-provide-voter-registration-rolls"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been filed in the federal districts of the respective states. They argue that the federal government is privy to the data under two federal laws, the Help Americans Vote Act (HAVA) and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), that were passed “to ensure that states have proper and effective voter registration and voter list maintenance programs,” the Justice Department said in a news release. “Clean voter rolls are the foundation of free and fair elections,” said U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in a statement announcing the lawsuits. “Every state has a responsibility to ensure that voter registration records are accurate, accessible, and secure — states that don’t fulfill that obligation will see this Department of Justice in court.” This is in addition to suits it had already filed against Maine and Oregon. </span></p>

Harper, a landmark case examining </span><a href="https://www.naco.org/news/naco-joins-local-government-associations-file-amicus-brief-historic-supreme-court-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether state legislatures have exclusive power to set rules regarding federal elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the Court adopts a ruling favorable to this argument, also known as the Independent State Legislature Theory (ISLT), local governments will face significant obstacles in fulfilling our responsibility to administer free and fair elections. NACo has joined with the National League of Cities, International Municipal Lawyers Association, International County/City Managers Association and U.S. Conference of Mayors to file an amicus brief urging the Court to protect local control over elections by rejecting the ISLT. The local government associations’ amicus brief argues that the adoption of the ISLT would jeopardize our ability to carry out these processes smoothly and efficiently, which could ultimately threaten the constitutional right of U.S. citizens to vote. For instance, the ISLT is likely to lead state legislators to set different rules for federal elections and state elections (which are governed by state constitutions), creating a confusing, burdensome and costly two-tier election system. Under the ISLT, state legislatures may erode or overrule local control of voting systems and polling locations, resulting in disorganized elections and potentially fostering distrust in the electoral process. Furthermore, the ISLT would almost certainly limit the ability of state and local elections officials to respond in real-time to emergencies and natural disasters.</span></p>

The suit argues that the Department of Homeland Security, along with the Department of Government Efficiency team, is &#8220;working rapidly to create precisely the type of &#8216;national data banks&#8217; the American people and Congress have consistently resisted, and the Privacy Act was designed to prevent.&#8221; The suit was filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., on behalf of the League of Women Voters, the Electronic Privacy Information Center and five unnamed U.S. citizens.</span></p>

Bryan deferred until future proceedings the question of whether Lindell — one of the country’s most prominent propagators of false claims that the 2020 election was a fraud — acted with the “actual malice” that Smartmatic still needs to prove to collect any damages. The judge said there are “genuine fact disputes” as to whether Lindell’s statements were made “with knowledge that they were false or made with reckless disregard to their falsity.” He noted that the defense says Lindell has an “unwavering belief” that his statements were truthful. The statements cited by the judge arose from Lindell’s criticism of the results of the 2020 election in Los Angeles County. The judge ruled there were 51 specific times when Lindell falsely claimed — in documentaries he produced and through various media and personal appearances — that Smartmatic interfered with the results. “The Court concludes that, based on the record presented, no reasonable trier of fact could find that any of the statements at issue are true,” Bryan wrote.</span></p>

The brief filing doesn&#8217;t cite the settlement terms. Spokespeople for Giuliani and the Colorado-based Dominion said that the terms are confidential and declined to comment further. &#8220;The Parties have agreed to a confidential settlement to this matter,&#8221; a Dominion spokesperson told CBS News in a statement.

League President Bonnie Miller and Benton County chapter President Danielle Quesnell are also plaintiffs. Two other ballot question groups, Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, joined as intervenor-plaintiffs in July.

Chau spoke in 2022 about threats made against election workers and the lack of training for them during a panel discussion on the short-lived streaming show “The Problem with Jon Stewart&#8221; in 2022. Denver paid Chau $65,000 under the settlement agreement, her lawyer, David Lane, said. A copy of the Sept. 2 deal said Denver denied any wrongdoing against Chau. Representatives for the city attorney’s office and the clerk and recorder’s office, which runs elections, did not immediately respond to emails and telephone calls requesting comment. Chau alleged she was removed as a supervisor because of her comments on the show and told she could be a voting hotline representative instead because no one from the public would recognize her in that job. She considered it a demotion and did not accept the new assignment. Chau earned about $10,000 a year working on elections, doing the job mostly because, as an immigrant, she felt privileged to live in a democracy, Lane said. He said the loss of her job was devastating. Chau&#8217;s lawsuit said she had a right to speak about a matter of public importance as a private citizen under the First Amendment. According to court documents, Denver said Chau was speaking as a government employee about her job and that it did not violate her free speech rights. The city denied she was terminated or demoted, just reassigned.</span></p>

State officials have not yet responded to the lawsuit. But Neal Kurk and three other New Hampshire residents are seeking to insert themselves into the lawsuit, arguing they have an interest in its outcome as registered voters concerned about their privacy. In a court motion filed September 30, Kurk, Portsmouth Attorney Christopher Cole, former Democratic state representative Bob Perry, and liberal activist Louise Spencer have asked to intervene in the litigation, which would allow the group to file its own motions asking the judge to strike down the lawsuit.  “DOJ’s demands not only run roughshod over federalism principles and New Hampshire law — they spurn Proposed Intervenors’ privacy rights,” the motion, brought by Steven Dutton of McLane Middleton, attorney Paul Twomey, and the Elias Law Group reads. Late September 30, U.S Magistrate Judge Andrea Johnston granted a request by the federal government to pause the lawsuit until the end of the federal government shutdown; the case is expected to eventually resume.</span></p>

The state Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision upholds lower court rulings that Washington County election officials violated voters’ rights by misleading them about the status of their mail-in ballots.  This prevented voters from challenging the board’s decision to disqualify 259 vote-by-mail ballots or casting provisional ballots as a backup to ensure their votes were counted, the courts said. “We must interpret the Election Code and its statutory procedures in a way that ‘favors the fundamental right to vote and enfranchises, rather than disenfranchises, the electorate,’” Justice Kevin Dougherty wrote for the majority, quoting the court’s 2020 decision resolving issues surrounding the then-new vote-by-mail law.  “Reading the Code as allowing county boards to withhold readily available information from voters does not serve that goal,” Dougherty wrote.</span></p>

Coble’s ruling doesn’t mean the transfer is imminent. State and federal officials are still working out the details for security safeguards and how the data will be transmitted, according to the agency. In his conclusion, Coble noted he has “grave concerns about federal overreach and encroachment over this State’s sovereignty.” However, he wrote, that’s not the issue at hand. He laid out several reasons for denying the motion to temporarily block the release of data. First, he said, Calhoun County voter Anne Crook has failed to prove she’ll suffer harm without an injunction. Her motion sought to block any exchange of data until there’s a memorandum of understanding between the election agency and U.S. Department of Justice. “Federal law likely preempts state law in this area,” Coble wrote in his conclusion. “The State at this point has interpreted the law as requiring compliance.” He postponed deciding on Gov. Henry McMaster’s request to dismiss the case.</span></p>

It’s part of a lawsuit filed by the League of Women Voters of Tarrant County and the League of United Latin American Citizens Fort Worth Council 4568. The lawsuit alleges the county’s mid-decade redistricting is unconstitutional, naming Tarrant County, the commissioners court and County Judge Tim O’Hare as defendants. Fahey heard arguments and testimony in the 348th District Court in the request for an injunction filed by the two groups. The request comes as the two organizations work with the Texas Voting Rights Coalition in an attempt to stop the voting maps, which opponents have described as racist and a power grab. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that the map is not legally valid because it focuses on population and partisanship without consideration for other state constitutional requirements for redistricting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5168" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Wisconsin:</strong> The Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on September 25 on </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/seventh-circuit-unlikely-to-apply-federal-voting-law-to-wisconsin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the constitutionality of Wisconsin’s exemption from the transparency requirements of the National Voter Registration Act </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of 1993. In January 2024, the Public Interest Legal Foundation nonprofit requested Wisconsin’s voter registration list with voters’ birth years. Wisconsin Election Commission administrator, Meagan Wolfe, directed the group to the public records portal in February, where the list costs $5 per 1,000 voters, capped at $12,500. The foundation called the fee unreasonable and accused Wolfe of violating federal election law requiring states to provide voter rolls at a reasonable cost upon request, although Wisconsin has a contentious exception. The nonprofit sued Wolfe in April 2024 under the National Voter Registration Act; however, the Western District of Wisconsin federal court sided with election officials. The group appealed, and last week, a Seventh Circuit panel, including Judges Diane Sykes, Frank Easterbrook and Michael Brennan, weighed the scope and constitutionality of Wisconsin’s exemption from the law’s transparency requirements. States that allowed election day voter registration when the act became law or didn’t require registration at all are exempted from the Act’s transparency requirements. Assistant Wisconsin Attorney General Brian Keenan argued that applying the same transparency rules to those states would be impractical, since their voter rolls are constantly changing. Attorney Andrew Braniff, representing the United States Civil Rights Division, agreed with Keenan and added that it doesn’t make sense to apply other parts of the voter registration act, like the halt on inactive voter purging 90 days before an election, because they can simply re-register when they arrive at the polling place. “The NVRA is in itself a jigsaw,” Braniff said. “All the pieces fit together, and the pieces simply don’t work if you apply them to states that have same day registration processes.” The nonprofit does not dispute Wisconsin’s exempt status. Instead, it claims that the act’s exemption is facially unconstitutional because it does not apply the same requirements to every single state. It asks the court to sever the exception completely or force the federal government to provide justification for the unequal regulation.</span></p>

From partisan gerrymandering and primary systems that drive polarization to calls for proportional representation and ranked-choice voting, Americans are increasingly debating how electoral structures shape the health of our republic. This event—part of R Street’s 250th Anniversary Series—brings together R Street’s Governance Policy Director, Matthew Germer; political analyst Chris Stirewalt; and legal scholar Walter Olson to explore the landscape of electoral reform and what it means for American democracy at 250. Together, they will examine: How current electoral practices affect representation, accountability, and public trust. The range of reforms under discussion, from proportional representation to ranked-choice voting and beyond. The legal, political, and cultural barriers to reform. How the Founders’ principles—equality, popular sovereignty, and civic virtue—might guide us in strengthening democratic institutions today. A reception will follow to continue the conversation. When: October 21. Where: Washington, DC. </span></p>
