<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With another summer of reading now behind us, it’s time to put down the beach reads and get back to the business at hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with that in mind, we reached out to a number of state and local elections officials, researchers and stakeholders in the elections administration realm to find out, other than </span><a href="http://electionline.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (OF COURSE), what newsletters, blogs, Substacks, etc. they are reading and podcasts they are listening to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This list is by no means exhaustive and we’ve kept it to mostly a national focus although we did get some good state-specific recommendations from folks as well. If you’re reading or listening to something that’s not listed, let us know and we’ll update the list in a future edition of electionlineWeekly.</span></p>

Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!!,&#8221; Trump said on Truth Social on August 30. &#8220;Also, No Mail-In Voting, Except For Those That Are Very Ill, And The Far Away Military.&#8221; He did not say what type of identification he wants to require, when he would sign the order or why he has the authority to impose the rule.

The policy says &#8220;that only state and local election officials will be permitted to offer voter registration services at the end of administrative naturalization ceremonies.&#8221; Groups like the League of Women Voters criticized the decision. They often partner with local and state election officials or supplement their work to administer registration services — and that includes during naturalization ceremonies. Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, said in a</span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/league-women-voters-statement-uscis-policy-restricting-voter-registration"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that this new policy &#8220;is an attempt to keep new citizens from accessing their full rights.&#8221;</span></p>

In </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/09/republican-lawmakers-push-for-hand-marked-ballots-in-november-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, key lawmakers called for a rapid test-run of hand-marked paper ballots in this year’s elections, switching from touchscreens in some polling places. A switch would comply with part of a state law passed last year requiring the elimination of computerized QR codes from ballots by July 1, 2026. Two House Republican committee chairmen stressed “the urgency of the matter” in a letter to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. In response, Raffensperger’s office said Tuesday a test of hand-marked paper ballots isn’t allowed under Georgia law, which requires all counties to use a uniform voting system with touchscreens and ballot scanners. Raffensperger has defended the security and accuracy of Georgia’s voting system, saying audits repeatedly show Georgia’s vote counts are correct. “No matter how you look at it, it’s never been easier to vote, and it’s hard to cheat,” Raffensperger said last month. “We verify how accurate the machines were versus the hand-marked paper ballots, and the machines have never had an error yet.” And in </span><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/dallas-county-republicans-explore-hand-counting-tens-of-thousands-of-ballots-in-march/ar-AA1LOouU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the <em>Dallas Morning News</em>, the Dallas County Republican Party is exploring the idea of hand-counting thousands of ballots during its March 3, 2026 primary. Chairman Allen West told the paper the party’s executive committee will discuss five “courses of action” that could include hand-marked paper ballots and hand-counting during early voting or on election day. </span></p>

In this episode, hosts Eric Fey and Brianna Lennon speak with Eddy Zerbe. He’s the deputy director of the Students Learn Students Vote Coalition, which works to engage college-aged voters.

Hardin County will receive “I Voted” stickers featuring Alyson’s design from the Secretary of State’s Office. Other county clerks may request to have the redesigned sticker to provide to voters during the May 2026 primary election.</span></p>

Diamond served as a vocal critic of the state’s child welfare system, repeatedly calling for it to be separated from the larger state Department of Health and Human Services. He attended many of the trials following child deaths and became friends with surviving family members who continued to grieve their loss for years.</span></p>

That’s a lot of languages. We’ve done multilingual usability testing before and have written a guide on how to conduct them. But we’ve never conducted a study with this many languages at once. It was a new and exciting challenge. We planned for the test throughout 2024. Then, over a 2-week period in January 2025, we coached KCE through usability testing and synthesis. Along the way, we learned that not only is testing in this many languages possible, it’s absolutely doable! It can also lead to valuable insights that make multilingual voting materials clearer and more effective. We’re sharing </span><a href="https://civicdesign.org/multilingual-testing-rcv/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this case study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give a behind-the-scenes look at the process. Whether you’re thinking about adding 1 more language, 5 more, or just getting started, we hope it helps you design and run your own multilingual testing.</span></p>

The Arizona Republican Party, Arizona Free Enterprise Club, Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections, and a Yavapai County voter filed a lawsuit in 2023 challenging state election rules, including the ways county recorders can verify a voter’s signature on their early ballot. The plaintiffs specifically challenged rules allowing election workers to compare the signature on an early ballot to signatures on any other election-related document, including early ballot envelopes from prior elections. They argued state law only allows recorders to use a person’s original voter registration for signature verification. “Certain of these materials, and particularly early ballot envelopes submitted in prior elections, however, are not “registration records,” and hence are not a lawful comparative reference for conducting signature validation,” according to the original lawsuit. In a 2024 ruling, Judge John Napper wrote that an updated version of the Secretary of State&#8217;s Election Procedures Manual allows for the use of old ballot envelopes for signature verification. And he found the Arizona Legislature chose to accept that allowance as it updated the state’s election laws. On August 27, an Arizona Court of Appeals panel upheld the lower court ruling. The judges found the Arizona Republican Party and other plaintiffs did not have standing to sue in the first place,</span><a href="https://www.appeals2.az.gov/Decisions/CV20240221memo.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to an opinion authored by Judge Jeffrey Sklar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sklar wrote that the plaintiffs disagree with the way the Secretary of State Adrian Fontes interpreted the state law governing signature verification, not that Fontes failed to fulfill duties the secretary of state is required to perform. “This amounts to issue advocacy, which as we have explained, cannot confer standing,” Sklar wrote. An attorney for the plaintiffs said they have not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling to the Arizona Supreme Court.</span></p>

Castillo was released on a promise to appear in Bridgeport Superior Court on September 2, 2025. Castillo has previously been charged in this incident.

The offices have refused to provide it. The Citizen is a nonprofit news outlet operated by the Indiana Citizen Education Foundation, Inc. Reporter Marilyn Odendahl requested the list in October 2024, after Secretary of State Diego Morales and Attorney General Todd Rokita issued news releases about the request. According to the lawsuit, Rokita’s office denied the records request in December last year on behalf of both offices. Odendahl then filed a complaint with then-Indiana Public Access Counselor Luke Britt, who ruled in February that the “denial was improper based on the law as plainly written.” In March, the statewide officeholders sent a letter disagreeing with the ruling, but offered to allow the Citizen “limited public access” consisting of in-person inspection and the ability to make only “a handwritten transcription” of the records. The Citizen objected to the rules but tried to schedule a time to review the list in July. Rokita and Morales asked new Public Access Counselor Jennifer Ruby to reconsider the complaint and withdrew their offer. There has been no further contact between the parties, according to the lawsuit.</span></p>

Prezzato voted using his absentee ballot and then showed up at his polling place and voted there as well. A news release from Attorney General Dana Nessel said Prezzato “acknowledged that he acted recklessly.” As part of a plea agreement, he will serve six months of delayed probation. After that, the charges can be dismissed with prejudice — closing the case permanently — if Prezzato meets the conditions of his probation. His formal sentencing is set for the end of October. “Voting twice undermines our democratic process,” Nessel said. “My office will continue to prosecute those who violate our voting laws to ensure Michigan voters have confidence in the integrity of our elections.”</span></p>

Danielle Miller, 51, of rural Nashwauk was charged in October 2024 with three felony counts of absentee voter fraud after allegedly attempting to vote for Donald Trump on behalf of her deceased mother. Miller initially pleaded not guilty to all three counts in May before petitioning to enter a guilty plea on August 21. But at her plea hearing on Monday, Miller failed to accurately state the factual basis for her plea, leading the judge to reject it. Minnesota statute requires defendants to state the factual basis before the judge can accept a guilty plea to ensure the defendant knows what they are pleading guilty to. Itasca County Attorney Jacob Fauchald said Miller told the judge she was intoxicated and that someone else mailed in the absentee ballots. He said this is not what the investigation suggests. In a subsequent court filing, Miller&#8217;s attorney Justin Braulick said she intends to use the defense of voluntary intoxication. That doesn’t absolve a defendant of the crime, but it can be considered a factor of the defendant’s state of mind or intent.</span></p>

Having previously pled guilty, Torres faced judgment on September 2nd for her schemes that involved shaking down Bronx residents and falsifying election records. U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton, called out Torres for abusing her power and declared the city&#8217;s stance on purging corruption, &#8220;By shaking down Bronx residents and falsifying election records, she undermined trust in the very system New Yorkers depend on to make their voices heard.&#8221; During her criminal tenure spanning from at least 2019 to August 2024, Torres schemed her way to approximately $40,970, as the prosecution detailed. She demanded and accepted payments for allocating individuals as poll workers, often taking in $150 through various forms of payment, directing some to her or a local Bronx organization. Torres altered money orders and checks intended for the organization to deposit into her bank account.</span></p>

In a proposed consent order filed this week, the parties agreed to end the case with North Carolina required to produce reports on efforts to fix missing voter information and hand over updated voter roll records to the federal government “upon request.” The federal government sued in May, alleging the state violated the Help America Vote Act by using a voter registration form that didn’t require a driver’s license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number. Federal lawyers said the state added restraints without confirming identifying information and requested that a full list of corrected records be turned over once the rolls are updated. In the proposed agreement — still subject to a federal judge’s approval — North Carolina would be required to use a voter registration form that complies with the Help America Vote Act, update its federal voter list, and contact voters with missing information to update their records. Voters with gaps in their records would still remain registered, but would have to cast provisional ballots if their information isn’t corrected before an election. The agreement aims “to ensure that the remedy complies fully with federal law, minimizes any inconvenience to voters, and ensures that each affected voter’s ballot will be counted for federal offices if the voter is otherwise eligible to vote.</span></p>

The tribes say that the decision, if allowed to go into effect, would not only limit their representation in the North Dakota Legislature but be a detriment to racial equality across all seven states in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. Private groups in these states would no longer be able to challenge state or local governments for alleged racially discriminatory voting practices. The tribes’ lawsuit, filed in 2022, accuses a legislative district map adopted by North Dakota lawmakers in 2021 of unlawfully diluting the power of Native American voters. While U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in a 2023 ruling agreed with the tribes and in early 2024 put an alternate map in place, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned his decision in May. The appellate court concluded that the tribes do not have standing to bring the case because a law they used to bring it, known as Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, can only be enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice. Section 2 makes it illegal to limit someone’s voting rights on the basis of race.</span></p>

Graham alleges in a federal lawsuit that she was released from her role as Director of Elections and Voter Registration for excessive absenteeism, which she said was caused by a medical condition. The lawsuit also alleges that the county did not offer her information about disability options, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), until after she exhausted all her personal time off in April of 2024. Her complaint said she was granted FMLA in May but reportedly needed more time off to care for her mother, who was suffering from medical issues. Graham alleges that her conditions and requests for accommodations are protected by FMLA and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). She also alleges claims of discrimination, hostile work environment and failure to accommodate in her suit.

She claimed that providing it would violate her right to privacy under the South Carolina Constitution. The Department of Justice (DOJ) originally issued the state a deadline of August 21 to comply, which the state asked to extend. The DOJ has given the state a new deadline of September 5 to release the records.

Lawmakers moved the deadline for filing ballot measure petitions from the first Tuesday in May to the first Tuesday in February in election years with passage of House Bill 1184. Dakotans for Health group argued that the new deadline shortened the amount of time it takes for the backers of ballot measures to obtain the signatures they need to qualify a measure for the ballot, infringing on its free speech rights. Among the group’s complaints was that the shortened timeframe for collecting signatures concentrated that window during South Dakota’s winter, when petition gatherers are outside during sometimes harsh weather conditions. “We are asking the court to protect the right of South Dakotans to engage in direct democracy by issuing an injunction to stop the enforcement of HB 1184,” Dakotans for Health co-found Rick Weiland said at the time of challenging the law. “If this law is allowed to stand, it will severely restrict our ability to gather the signatures needed to bring important issues before voters. The people of South Dakota deserve better.” Faced with a nine-month deadline under HB 1184, Theeler agreed that it was still too restrictive. She also agreed that Dakotans for Health, which has sponsored several ballot measures, had standing to bring the challenge, finding the group faced “concrete, particularized and actual injury from the filing deadlines created by HB 1184.” Nor was Theeler convinced that extending the deadline for petitions by three months would allow enough time to resolve a conflict over the legitimacy of those petitions. “However,” she wrote in her ruling, “even if this court were to agree that the state has a regulatory interest allowing citizens more time to litigate petition challenges prior to an election, the state has not shown that a nine-month filing deadline satisfies that interest. The nine-month deadline simply allows for three more months of litigation that may or may not result in a final resolution before an election. The state acknowledges as much.” Theeler ordered Secretary of State Monae Johnson not to enforce the provisions of HB 1184, effectively keeping the deadlines for ballot measures in place at the first Tuesday of May. The state has not indicated if it will appeal.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin ordered a purge of voter rolls that the U.S. Department of Justice, Democratic Virginia lawmakers and civil rights advocates said it was too close to Election Day. Giles is allowing the case to proceed and move into the next phase of legal scrutiny.  Filed by the Virginia Coalition for Immigrants’ Rights (VACIR), Virginia’s chapter of the League of Women Voters, and African Communities Together, the groups assert that Youngkin’s administration violated the federal National Voter Registration Act by removing people from voter rolls within 90 days of last November’s elections.  The federal law entails a 90-day “quiet period” that both former President Joe Biden’s administration and the Virginia groups’ suits alleged Youngkin violated. Youngkin had issued an executive order on Aug. 7, 2024 — exactly 90 days before the 2024 elections — before touting it  on Fox News that same day. </span></p>
