														<p><strong>Election Training at Your Pace</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Michele Forney, Senior Election Expert<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elections Group</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may know The Elections Group from the conference and training circuit. You may know The Elections Group from our monthly newsletter, busy webinar schedule or hundreds of resources available on our </span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may not know The Elections Group as online training developers and course administrators of the </span><a href="http://www.electionlearninglab.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Learning Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have more than a dozen self-paced courses available to all election professionals. To build these courses, our team consults best practices and channels our broad election experience and deep expertise. Our goal with the Election Learning Lab is to <img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13446" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TEG09.25.25A-300x153.png" alt="" width="300" height="153" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TEG09.25.25A-300x153.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TEG09.25.25A.png 712w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />help current election professionals enhance their skills in support of efficient, safe and transparent elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did I mention that these courses are <strong>available for free</strong>? All you need to do is visit the Election Learning Lab and register with a username and password. Once you’re registered, you can explore the course descriptions, see which courses we recommend taking together and begin your online learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because you’re busy and constantly pulled in many directions, each course is <strong>self-paced</strong>. You can take courses whenever it’s convenient, pause when you need to and resume where you left off at any time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The courses are based on <strong>election practices nationwide</strong>. When courses reference processes or procedures used in particular states, they are typically presented as illustrative examples. Each course contains interactive activities and knowledge checks to help ensure information retention, but there are no time limits and quizzes are not graded.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13444" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TEG09.25.25B-1024x343.png" alt="" width="640" height="214" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TEG09.25.25B-1024x343.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TEG09.25.25B-300x101.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TEG09.25.25B-768x258.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TEG09.25.25B.png 1270w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elections Group also produces <strong>tailored courses, mini-courses and assessments</strong> that individual states incorporate into their <strong>statewide election education programs</strong>.  </span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13394" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VoterRegForm-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Data Sharing</strong>: Late last week, Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson announced that Texas has </span><a href="https://statescoop.com/texas-voter-data-agreements-mou/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">entered into memorandums of understanding (MOU) with nine states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Alabama, Arkansas, </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2025/09/23/kansas-among-nine-states-to-swap-voter-rolls-with-texas-in-effort-to-find-duplicates-prevent-fraud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kentucky, </span><a href="https://www.ktalnews.com/news/louisiana/louisiana-texas-voter-roll-swap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia – to share voter registration data, strengthening efforts to prevent duplicate registrations. The agreements establish a secure and cooperative process for comparing voter registration records, providing a critical tool to detect and prevent potential voter fraud. “These agreements are a significant step in our ongoing commitment to maintain accurate voter registration lists and upholding the integrity of our elections,” said Secretary Nelson. “By working together, we are demonstrating how states can responsibly share information while protecting voter data.”  The MOUs outline how the two states will securely exchange voter registration data while adhering to strict confidentiality and cybersecurity protocols. The agreements also ensure that any instances of duplicate registrations or potential voter fraud identified through this process are shared with appropriate authorities for further investigation. These MOUs serve as a model for future partnerships. Texas plans to establish similar agreements with additional states. These agreements will further enhance election security by allowing states to work together to identify cross-state duplicate registrations and prevent voting in multiple jurisdictions. A spokesperson for the Kansas Secretary of State’s office, Whitney Tempel, said Texas can’t share other states’ data with the federal government. A provision in the agreement prohibits states from sharing data with any third party. “This is a common sense step toward cleaner rolls and better election administration,” Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab (R) said. “We look forward to establishing agreements with other states in the future.” Currently, 25 states and the District of Columbia are members of ERIC. </span></p>

Some members of the group looking to remove the machines because of perceived security risks then </span><a href="https://www.13abc.com/2025/09/22/residents-seneca-county-speak-out-voting-machines-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tried to become managers at polling locations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on election day. The county BOE said no and Elections Director Lori Elchert defended the policy at the time as a compromise, stating that leadership positions carry greater responsibility. Following the August vote, the Secretary of State’s office later issued guidance stating that disqualifying individuals based on affiliation or ideology was not permitted under state law. This week, the Board approved a motion 3-0 to allow voting machine skeptics to serve as polling location managers. The approved motion read: “Pursuant to the guidance from the Ohio Secretary of State&#8217;s Office to rescind the motion adopted on Aug. 26 which stated that individuals publicly or actively working against voting machines are ineligible to serve as voting location managers.” Duane Clary, a member of the Coalition of Concerned Voters of Ohio, a group advocating for election transparency and questioning the use of electronic voting machines, welcomed the board’s reversal and criticized the initial decision. “We’re not conspiracy theorists. We follow the Constitution, and the Constitution cannot be a conspiracy,” Clary said</span></p>

In a</span><a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-09-23-letter-to-hjc.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> submitted in response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, attorneys for YouTube’s parent company Alphabet said the decision to bring back banned accounts reflected the company’s commitment to free speech. It said the company values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes their reach and important role in civic discourse. “No matter the political atmosphere, YouTube will continue to enable free expression on its platform, particularly as it relates to issues subject to political debate,” the letter read. According to The Associated Press, the move is the latest in a cascade of content moderation rollbacks from tech companies, who cracked down on false information during the pandemic and after the 2020 election but have since faced pressure from President Donald Trump and other conservatives who argue they unlawfully stifled right-wing voices in the process. YouTube in 2023</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/youtube-election-misinformation-policy-42a6c1b7623c485dbc04eb76ad443247"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> phased out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its policy to remove content that falsely claims the 2020 election, or other past U.S. presidential elections, were marred by “widespread fraud, errors or glitches.”  Asked for more information about the reinstatement process, a spokesperson for YouTube did not immediately respond to The Associated Press’ request for comment.</span></p>

This resource provides an overview of restrictions that limit agencies, officials, or government entities from receiving or spending private funds on the conduct of elections. Since the 2020 election, at least 29 states have enacted such restrictions, which are each summarized in this report. CEIR released the first iteration of this resource in August 2023 and regularly updates it to reflect new restrictions and changes to existing restrictions.</span></p>

A new report by Tova Wang, Director of Research Projects in Democratic Practice at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard’s Kennedy School, explores the</span><a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hvd-Ash-Allegiant-Paper-Accessible.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impact of stadium voting in 2024 at Allegiant Stadium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, drawing widespread, bipartisan support from voters and election officials and strengthening the relationship between the Las Vegas Raiders and the surrounding community. In the 2024 general election, Allegiant Stadium drew over 4,200 voters to cast their ballots on Election Day, demonstrating the unique position of stadium facilities to provide an enjoyable voting experience and strengthen civic engagement. Voters at Allegiant Stadium were younger and more likely to be first-time voters compared to other polling locations in Clark County, with the experience drawing widespread, bipartisan support from voters, election officials, and the Las Vegas Raiders. This report explores the benefits of stadium voting by harnessing the power of sports to shape the fan-voter experience.</span></p>

							<h2>Ballot Measures, Legislation & Rulemaking</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13450" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OCCalifSeal-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Orange County, California</strong>: This week, the  Orange County Board of Supervisors </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-24/orange-county-wants-to-know-are-any-dogs-or-cats-registered-to-vote"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directed staff to cross-reference voter rolls with pet registration data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the county in order to make sure there are no four-legged voters with names like Fido, Fifi, Spot, Sparky or Lucky casting ballots in the next special election in November. “How do we check that dogs and cats or whatever are not on our (voter) rolls?” Supervisor Dan Wagner asked during a meeting. The measure, introduced by Wagner and Supervisor Janet Nguyen, came after a Costa Mesa woman was charged early this month with five felony counts after allegedly registering her dog to vote. According to The Los Angeles Times, supervisors directed the Orange County Registrar of Voters to review thousands of voter records to ensure that no other pets have been registered to vote in the county and this week, directed the agency to expand that review to thousands of more pet registrations to ensure no other four-legged pets are casting votes. The registrar recently checked pet registrations in all unincorporated communities in the county against voter records, and was directed Tuesday to try to expand that review to pet registrations in all incorporated cities within the county. Bob Page, registrar of voters for the county, said the agency this month has cross-referenced nearly 8,000 pet registration records in unincorporated areas in the county at the direction of the board, and has found no indication of pets getting registered to vote in that review. The Registrar of Voters is also requesting the same data from cities that contract with the county for animals services to get access to that data, Page said, and will review those pet records against the county voter rolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13448" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/HamiltonCoIN-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Hamilton County, Indiana:</strong> The Hamilton County Election Board failed to get a unanimous vote it needed to </span><a href="https://www.wrtv.com/news/local-news/hamilton-county/vote-center-proposal-dies-in-hamilton-county"><span style="font-weight: 400;">move the county to a countywide Vote Center model</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On September 18, Republican appointee Ray Adler cast the deciding vote against the measure, keeping the county in a traditional precinct-based voting system. County Clerk Kathy Kreag Williams and Democratic appointee Greg Purvis voted in favor of the measure. According to WRTV, the decision comes after the Election Board in Allen County approved a similar proposal earlier in the week. “I just think we should let Allen County go through it and see what problems they have,” Adler, the Republican appointee who voted down the measure, said in the release. “We’re changing voting for hundreds of thousands of people and I want to make sure it’s not an experiment.” According to the release sent from Hamilton County, the Vote Center model requires approval from all three governing bodies: County Commissioners, County Council and the Election Board. In Hamilton County, both the commissioners and the seven members of the council voted unanimously in favor of the measure. Public sentiment in a countywide survey suggested that 60% of the respondents were in favor of the measure, while 10% were indifferent, the release said. 68 of Indiana&#8217;s 92 counties have already adopted the Vote Center Model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13449" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MissouriSeal-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Missouri Ballot Measure</strong>: State Republicans recently advanced a </span><a href="https://boltsmag.org/missouri-amendment-on-ballot-initiatives/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would effectively kill the initiative process. The</span><a href="https://house.mo.gov/Bill.aspx?bill=HJR3&amp;year=2025&amp;code=S2"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will now go before voters for a statewide referendum in 2026, would drastically raise the threshold for a citizen-led initiative to pass. While all measures in the state currently require a majority vote statewide, the GOP proposal would require citizen-led initiatives to also win majorities in each of the state’s eight congressional districts.  Constitutional amendments placed on the ballot by legislators would be exempt from the new hurdle, and would still only require a statewide majority to pass. Under the proposed new rule for citizen-led ballot measures, all five popular initiatives that Missouri voters have approved since 2020 would have failed instead, a Bolts analysis found. Mallory Rusch, executive director of Empower Missouri says the new rules, which would be unique in the country, would spell the end of citizen petitions. “A lot of activists say that, if we want to do something via initiative, this might be our last year,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3947" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Wisconsin-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Wisconsin:</strong> Wisconsin’s controversial practice of</span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/wisconsin/2025/09/23/bill-would-outlaw-drawdowns-and-require-audits-rep-scott-krug/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> randomly removing ballots to resolve discrepancies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between the number of ballots and the number of voters would be prohibited under new draft legislation that requires meticulous audits in every county. Wisconsin’s law allowing drawdowns is almost as old as the state, and it appears to be used most often in recounts. Other states have had similar laws, but most have repealed them. Drawdowns occur when records show more ballots cast than the number of voters who cast ballots. These discrepancies usually stem from minor recordkeeping errors or process mistakes. Multiple Wisconsin clerks have told Votebeat that they loathe the practice, and national election experts have been flabbergasted that it exists. A legislative study committee in 2005 questioned the practice’s constitutionality without resolving the issue. The bill also requires risk-limiting audits, a kind of post-election review designed to give statistical confidence that votes are accurately tallied. A pilot program would begin in 2026, with full implementation in 2027.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3355" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Georgia:</strong> Nicholas Wimbish, 26, of Milledgeville, was sentenced Sept. 18 to </span><a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/former-georgia-poll-worker-sentenced-bomb-threat-against-election-office"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 months in prison followed by one year of supervised release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He was also fined $2,000 by U.S. District Judge Marc Treadwell. Wimbish pleaded guilty earlier this year to one count of conveying false information and making hoaxes. According to court records, Wimbish was working at the Jones County Elections Office in Gray on Oct. 16, 2024, when he argued with a voter. Hours later, he researched the voter online and drafted a letter posing as that person. The letter threatened to bomb the polling site, target Wimbish and other poll workers, and contained graphic threats of violence. Wimbish mailed the letter to the county elections superintendent the next day. It arrived on Oct. 22, 2024. The letter included details intended to make it appear the voter was the author, accusing Wimbish of trying to influence ballots and calling him a &#8220;woke liberal fraudster.&#8221; It also warned poll workers to &#8220;look over their shoulder&#8221; and ended with a handwritten note that read, &#8220;PS boom toy in early vote place, cigar burning, be safe.&#8221; Wimbish later admitted he knew &#8220;boom toy&#8221; referred to an explosive device. &#8220;Ensuring the security of our polling places is essential. Americans must be able to express their political choices at the ballot box without fear of violence or harm,&#8221; U.S. Attorney William R. &#8220;Will&#8221; Keyes said in a statement. &#8220;These threats undermine the core values of our nation, and we will vigorously pursue justice in such matters.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3623" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LouisianaFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Louisiana</strong>: The U.S. Department of Justice</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2025-09-24-Supplemental-brief-for-the-United-States-as-amicus-curiae-supporting-appellees.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/doj-urges-scotus-to-end-key-vra-protection-for-minority-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amicus brief this week in Louisiana’s ongoing redistricting case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, arguing that the U.S. Supreme Court should significantly weaken the power of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) to block racial gerrymanders. Though not unexpected, the brief carries major symbolic weight. For decades, the Justice Department has been at the forefront of efforts to use Section 2 of the VRA to protect minority voting rights, most frequently in the redistricting process. Under President Donald Trump, it now argues for a radically narrowed interpretation of Section 2, which could make it all but useless in stopping racially motivated gerrymanders. In the case challenging Louisiana’s congressional map, the DOJ submitted an amicus brief calling the state’s creation of a second majority-Black congressional district “unconstitutional,” and describing current protections as little more than “electoral race-based affirmative action.” Solicitor General D. John Sauer asserted that intentionally drawing a second Black-majority district violates the Constitution. But the DOJ went further, arguing that the Voting Rights Act itself cannot justify race-conscious redistricting. “Section 2 does not supply a compelling interest to draw such districts because the statute would be unconstitutional if it required such race-based districting,” the filing declares.</span></p>

The lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop Secretary of State Bob Evnen from providing data to the DOJ. Federal officials have asked states for names, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers, saying they want the information to ensure accurate voter registration rolls.  Common Cause asked a Lancaster County District Court to find that the DOJ request violates Nebraska law protecting data privacy. It aims to prohibit the Secretary of State from providing the voter data to the DOJ or to limit the types of data shared. The Justice Department sent a letter to Nebraska’s secretary of state Sept. 8 with a Sept. 22 deadline to provide the data. The Secretary of State’s Office told the Examiner it hasn’t provided the data to the DOJ because of the lawsuit.</span></p>

According to Votebeat, </span><a href="https://www.lawforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dkt.-006-Summons-Compl-202509.17.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stands out because it seeks monetary damages for alleged violations of voting rights — a remedy that has become increasingly rare. According to election experts, that type of claim is unlikely to succeed. “These voters deserved better,” Scott Thompson, an attorney for the plaintiffs with the firm Law Forward, said in a statement. ”In Wisconsin, we value the right to vote, and there will be consequences when that right is denied.” The named plaintiffs are some of the 193 voters whose ballots didn’t get counted in the 2024 election. They’re suing the city of Madison, the city’s clerk office, former Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl, and current Deputy Clerk Jim Verbick, seeking monetary damages for the city’s failure to count the voters’ ballots. The complaint doesn’t specify the amount, but in a claim filed in March, the group representing the plaintiffs requested $34 million, or $175,000 for each disenfranchised voter. Madison’s interim City Clerk and City Attorney Mike Haas declined to comment on the lawsuit. This lawsuit aims to emphasize the importance of properly counting all ballots, and set a monetary penalty for denying a person their vote. </span></p>

From partisan gerrymandering and primary systems that drive polarization to calls for proportional representation and ranked-choice voting, Americans are increasingly debating how electoral structures shape the health of our republic. This event—part of R Street’s 250th Anniversary Series—brings together R Street’s Governance Policy Director, Matthew Germer; political analyst Chris Stirewalt; and legal scholar Walter Olson to explore the landscape of electoral reform and what it means for American democracy at 250. Together, they will examine: How current electoral practices affect representation, accountability, and public trust. The range of reforms under discussion, from proportional representation to ranked-choice voting and beyond. The legal, political, and cultural barriers to reform. How the Founders’ principles—equality, popular sovereignty, and civic virtue—might guide us in strengthening democratic institutions today. A reception will follow to continue the conversation. <strong>When:</strong> October 21. <strong>Where</strong>: Washington, DC. </span></p>
