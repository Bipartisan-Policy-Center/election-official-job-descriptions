														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Who Pays for Election Administration?</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Division of State and Local Responsibilities  </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julie Hochsztein, Research Fellow, and April Tan, Policy Lead<br />
</span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States and local jurisdictions share responsibility for conducting U.S. elections, including paying for expenses associated with election administration and voter registration. However, the division of these funding responsibilities across (or even within) states is often not clear to policymakers, the public, or election administrators. This leads to misunderstandings about who pays for what aspects of election administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These misunderstandings can have significant real-world consequences, with election administrators sometimes left scrambling for funds as policymakers and courts make important decisions based on flawed assumptions about election finance overall and specific election expenses like voting machines, training, polling places, and ballots.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13561" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Newser10.15.25-1024x915.png" alt="" width="640" height="572" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Newser10.15.25-1024x915.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Newser10.15.25-300x268.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Newser10.15.25-768x687.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Newser10.15.25.png 1112w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To better clarify funding structures in election administration, the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research (CEIR) recently released a</span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/who-pays-for-election-admin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailing which level of government was responsible for various types of election expenses in the administration of statewide general elections in November 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent studies have found that many Americans mistakenly believe that the federal government plays a large role in paying for elections. In reality, state and local governments bear the primary burden of paying for elections. The federal government only occasionally makes grants to state and local election offices for specific purposes. These federal funds are unpredictable and insufficient for officials to count on them for administering elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEIR conducted a review of state election statutes and regulations in all 50 states. This review found that, in the vast majority of states, the state and local governments share the financial responsibility of election administration. However, the details of this shared responsibility vary widely from one state to the next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using this 50-state review of election funds, a series of brief reports look at how states share the cost of specific aspects of election administration, such as</span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/who-pays-for-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> printing ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ,</span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/who-pays-for-election-notices/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sending election notices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/who-pays-for-voting-equipment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acquiring and maintaining voting equipment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , and more. The details of shared responsibility for election funding vary by topic within states as well varying from one state to the next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A Mix of Local and State Responsibilities</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most states, local governments pay for most election expenses through taxes and other public revenue streams at the county or municipal level. Even when local governments pay most election costs, many states pay or provide for specific aspects of election administration such as voter registration, poll worker training, or sample ballots.  Only a handful of states directly pay for most election expenses at the state level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some states reimburse local governments for a portion of their election expenses, though the process and amount of this reimbursement vary by state. This is typically accomplished with formulas that are based either on a fixed percentage, proportionally based on the number of registered voters, or some other factor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in Alabama the state reimburses counties for 50% of most statewide general election expenses, including ballots and supplies, compensation for election officials, and rental payments for polling places. In Colorado, the state reimburses counties for 45% of their election expenses when there is a state or federal level race on the ballot. Hawaii law requires that most election expenses are divided in half between the state and counties, with any statewide expenses divided on a prorated basis based on the number of registered voters in each county.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/who-pays-for-election-notices/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Pays for Election Notices?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”: Forty-eight states require notices about general elections but vary widely in who pays for or issues these notices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/who-pays-for-voting-equipment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Pays for Voting Equipment?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”: Capital purchases including tabulators and voting machines are paid in all or part by state governments in at least eight states with local governments authorized to purchase this equipment in the rest.</span></p>

Under an April ordinance, which passed in an assembly vote of 5-4, the borough’s Canvass Board must hand-count results from early voting ballots for a randomly selected contested race, as well as ballots from a randomly chosen race from each of two randomly chosen precincts, for a total of three blocks of votes. According to April Trickey, auditors counted 2,846 ballots from the race for school board seat C from early voting, as well as 492 ballots from borough assembly seat B between both Goldstream 2 and Moose Creek precincts. In order to perform the count, which Trickey said took about five hours between the combined races, the three auditors first had to separate borough ballots from those of other jurisdictions. To perform the added tasks this election year required, Trickey hired two extra members of the Canvass Board, folding auditors into the general verification process once the hand-count was completed. The final results from each of these counts agreed fully with the count from the Dominion voting machines, a conclusion that Trickey said took a couple of counts to determine for the early vote precinct. “You have X amount of ballots that’s been cast in that race. You have so many that nobody voted, you have so many, maybe, over votes, and then you have so many write-ins, and then where they found is their sort was incorrect on how they sorted the ovals for the two candidates that were on the ballot,” she explained.</span></p>

The state department&#8217;s website, VayaVotarColorado.gov, highlights resources aimed at providing accurate election information and voter registration services in Spanish. &#8220;It is important that every voter has access to accurate information when it comes to registering to vote and casting a ballot,” Secretary Griswold said. This outreach is part of a broader campaign by the Colorado government to ensure fair election processes for all eligible voters. VayaVotarColorado.gov will allow users to execute key electoral actions, such as registering to vote, updating their information, and finding local voting centers. In addition to online resources, starting this week, Coloradans can call a new multilingual hotline for live translation assistance with their ballots. This service extends support beyond Spanish, offering help in Vietnamese, Korean, Taiwanese, Chinese, and additional languages, addressing the linguistic diversity within the voter base. However, limitations on the assistance have been set to adhere to Colorado state laws. Interpreters are restricted to translating the content on the ballot but can&#8217;t stray into explaining Blue Book content or providing instructions on how to complete the ballot itself. Voters can gain access to an interpreter for ballot content by contacting their County Clerk, asking election judges or county staff at voting centers, or directly calling the Secretary of State’s Office.</span></p>

The new site details how election complaints and reported violations are investigated, outlines some of the safeguards in the process and shares examples of some of the most reported complaints. “While very few allegations result in actual violations of election law when investigated, educating the public on the investigative process will help clear up misconceptions and increase confidence in Nevada’s safe and secure elections,” said Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar. “Every report of an election violation is taken seriously and investigated by the Secretary of State’s Office. I’m proud of the work done at the state-level to increase transparency for the public and uphold the integrity of our electoral process.” </span></p>

He was 42. Bloomington Election commissioner Terry Luce said the commission is “very saddened by his loss.&#8221; “Luke loved the Bloomington Election Commission and what we stood for. He worked hard to help us maintain the integrity of the elections for the voters,” Luce said in a statement to WGLT. Fellow commissioner Jim Fruin called Stremlau a “true professional” and a “true gentleman.” Stremlau was named the commission’s executive director in September 2022. He previously worked as Keplr Vision in Bloomington and earned an associate’s degree from Heartland Community College, according to the commission. McLean County Clerk Kathy Michael, whose office oversees elections outside of Bloomington, noted her office worked regularly with Stremlau. “We are heartbroken for his family, friends, and staff at BEC. We at the McLean County Clerk’s office and all of McLean County, are here for you,” Michael said in a post to social media. “He was thorough and meticulous in everything he touched. He always stressed teamwork with his staff and valued their consistency and relationships with each other. He took his responsibility to the public very seriously and was a rule follower who did not take shortcuts,” said Fruin.</span></p>

The</span><a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/KEL25760.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Voter Purge Protection Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced by Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., and Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, would amend the National Voter Registration Act to make it more difficult for states to kick large numbers of voters off their rolls for actions that Democrats — and many election officials — say are common, overwhelmingly benign and not indicative of voter fraud. Padilla told reporters that the legislation would help ensure “that Americans cannot be stripped of their right to vote without proof that a voter has either passed away or has permanently moved out of their state.” Voters targeted for removal must also be notified by election officials “so that there’s no surprise when they show up to vote on election day that their name is not on the list and it’s too late to address whatever the issue may or may not be,” Padilla said. The bill has 22 Democratic co-sponsors in the Senate and 24 in the House but is unlikely to gain serious consideration under a Republican-controlled Congress, where most GOP members have long believed voter fraud is rampant and are broadly supportive of state and federal efforts to remove voters based on those same factors.</span></p>

After the closed session board meeting today, Oct. 14, Board Chair Kevin Crye shared a statement on behalf of all five board members, including three who voted to appoint Curtis just five months ago.  “The board unanimously respects the right of the press to have free and unfettered access to public information,” Crye said. “We condemn Mr. Curtis’ action of excluding the press and encourage him to maintain a high level of transparency and access to public information.” “If it occurs again, the board will move to censure,” Crye concluded, as a number of audience members clapped in response. In an interview with reporters after the meeting, Curtis said supervisors were confused indicating that this was not a matter of free speech. He said he didn’t want to share press releases with Shasta Scout because doing so seemed “morally wrong” due to his belief that the organization is “operating improperly” by reporting the news while registered as a nonprofit.  Moving forward, Curtis said, he will provide press releases on the Shasta’s election website so they’re available to everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4932" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Welcome-to-MI-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Michigan Ballot Measure</strong>: The Michigan Association of County Clerks</span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2025/10/15/county-clerks-unanimously-oppose-ranked-choice-voting-urge-michigan-voters-to-reject-ballot-measure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unanimously voted to oppose a ballot measure seeking to establish ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan, which is being put forth by Rank MI Vote for potential inclusion in the 2026 election.  The clerks cited concerns about timeliness of the certification of elections, confusion by voters and delays to any recounts or audits in their opposition to the measure.  “Michigan voters are used to knowing who won an election in a timely manner, so it’s incredibly important that we’re able to report accurate, unofficial results on election night,” said Kent County Clerk Lisa Posthumus Lyons in a press release from the association. “Determining a winner will take drastically longer under ranked-choice voting. Delayed results erode the public’s trust by fueling uncertainty and misinformation.” Marquette County Clerk Linda Talsma, who chairs the association, also noted in the release that while they do not generally take positions on ballot measures, the bipartisan group of county officials felt it necessary to urge voters to reject the initiative in this case. “Michigan voters already face some of the longest and most complex ballots in the nation, covering federal, state, county, city, township, school, and special district contests on a single ballot,” reads the official resolution passed by the clerks’ association. “The RankMIVote proposal would further complicate ballots by requiring voters to numerically rank candidates in certain contests while others remain unchanged, adding inconsistency, voter confusion, and voter fatigue.”</span></p>

One would alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president, giving all five to the winner of the popular vote statewide. The other would require elections in the state to be conducted exclusively using paper ballots counted by hand. The winner-take-all constitutional amendment is identical to State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams’ legislative resolution this year on letting voters decide whether to shift the state to winner-take-all, which did not get scheduled for a vote. A separate proposal to make the change in statute from State Sen. Loren Lippincott, Legislative Bill 3, fell to a filibuster. The proposed constitutional amendment for paper ballots and hand counting would ban many voting machines from being used. Voting machines that produce voter-verifiable paper records like Nebraska’s would be exempt. It would require all elections to be done by paper ballot by July 2027. The group would need to gather the signatures of 10 percent of the state’s registered voters for the winner-take-all initiative that would change the state constitution. The hand-counting ballot initiative would need 7 percent of the state’s registered voters, since that one is changing state law. Both have until July to get on the November 2026 ballot.   </span></p>

If signed into law, Senate Bill 293 would require all mail-in absentee ballots to be delivered to county boards of elections by the time polls close on Election Day. Current state law allows absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they arrive within four days following. Gaverone stated the proposal would bring Ohio’s process in line with federal election standards and recent executive orders signed by President Donald Trump back in March, which directed the U.S. Attorney General to enforce laws requiring ballots to be received by Election Day for counting. Gavarone is co-sponsoring the bill with Senator Andrew Brenner (R-Delaware). The legislation has been referred to the Senate General Government Committee for consideration.</span></p>

During nearly two-and-a-half hours of oral arguments, the court’s conservative justices signaled that they are likely to undermine a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, even if they may not ultimately strike it down altogether. This week’s</span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2025/24-109_feah.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oral argument</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the latest chapter in a dispute that dates back to 2022, when Louisiana adopted a new congressional map in the wake of the 2020 census. Roughly one-third of the state’s population is Black, but the 2022 map had only one majority-Black district out of the six districts allotted to the state. That prompted a group of Black voters to go to federal court, where they argued that the 2022 map violated Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act, which bars discrimination in voting practices. At this week’s oral argument, lawyer Janai Nelson, representing the Black voters, defended the 2024 map. She told the justices that “[a] mere two years ago, in Allen versus Milligan, a case nearly identical to” this one, the Supreme Court “noted that under certain circumstances, it has authorized race-based redistricting to remedy state redistricting maps that violate Section 2.” Louisiana Solicitor General Benjamin Aguiñaga, by contrast, urged the court to “reevaluate its voting precedents.” Although the state had defended the 2024 map when the case was before the Supreme Court in March, Aguiñaga told the justices on Wednesday that those precedents had “placed states in impossible situations where the only sure demand is more racial discrimination for more decades.” Therefore, he said, “we have taken the position that Section 2, insofar as it requires race-based redistricting, is unconstitutional.”</span></p>

The lawsuit seeks an earlier date for a special election to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Branch Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield. The suit alleges the current schedule prevents District 26 voters from having a voice during the 2026 fiscal session, which begins in April. The attorney general’s office is representing the defendants, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester. During this week’s hearing, Senior Assistant Attorney General Ryan Hale said the case should be dismissed because the plaintiff failed to state a claim and because of sovereign immunity, the legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts. James said she understood the time-sensitivity of the case at the end of the two-hour hearing, but didn’t issue a ruling. “I know it’s important to everyone here” that a decision be made in the case soon, James told the packed courtroom. “It will be quick.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office has obtained warrants to arrest two men, including paper ballot advocate Conrad Reynolds, on a </span><a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2025/oct/09/paper-ballot-advocate-faces-arkansas-misdemeanor/?news"><span style="font-weight: 400;">misdemeanor charge related to the November 2024 general election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Reynolds, a retired U.S. Army colonel who lost bids for the Republican nomination in Arkansas&#8217; 2nd congressional district in 2014 and 2022, and Dustin Black are accused of violating Arkansas Code §7-1-103, which prohibits electioneering within 100 feet of the entrance to a building where voting is taking place or being there for any purpose except to enter or leave the building. Reynolds of Conway is the leader of a group that has been advocating for counties to switch from voting machines to hand-marked and hand-counted ballots. &#8220;The evidence in this case includes a video of both men conducting exit polling approximately 30 feet from a polling site,&#8221; Griffin said in the news release. &#8220;This case, and the misdemeanor warrants we obtained, are about one thing: following the law,&#8221; he added.</span></p>

Chief Election Officer Scott Nago failed to address the RNC’s questions about what records the state maintains regarding voter rolls, the suit says, adding that this violates Hawai‘i’s open records law and federal disclosure requirements. The suit was filed in Honolulu’s First Circuit Court. Hawaiʻi law states that the counties, not the state, are responsible for maintaining and updating voter rolls, and the suit acknowledged that Nago had advised the RNC to contact the counties directly. But the suit argues that under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 all states are required to “conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from the official lists of eligible voters.” “It would be highly unlikely for the Office not to have any of the types of records requested, such as memos, manuals, policies, emails, or voter registration data,” the suit states. It added that the RNC reached out to elections officials on Kauaʻi and Hawaiʻi island for information about voters and was told to contact the state.</span></p>

Last week, the clerk’s office filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to get two bills — totaling more than $230,000 — paid so the county can plan for the 2026 election. In the motion, both companies indicated they would no longer work with the county unless they receive payment and are given assurances that they will be paid for work related to the 2026 election. “Elections must be planned months in advance,” Kaczmarek said in a written statement. “The time to contract with our vendors for the primary is now, and no business will agree to work they aren’t being paid for. The voters elected me to administer elections, and my efforts to do so continue to be illegally obstructed.” The two bills prompted the DuPage County state’s attorney’s office earlier this year to request a special prosecutor to conduct an investigation to determine if the clerk’s office violated state laws regarding competitive bidding. The Illinois attorney general’s office was appointed to the complaint but has not yet made a ruling or issued any findings.</span></p>

Young refused to dismiss a lawsuit challenging Indiana’s </span><a href="http://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/federal-court-deals-major-blow-to-indiana-gops-student-id-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">student ID voting ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a procedural win for young voters and pro-voting advocates who say the GOP-backed law was designed to suppress student voting. Young denied Republicans’ motion to dismiss a case brought by students and voting rights groups against Indiana. The ruling means the challenge can proceed — and the court’s detailed reasoning suggests it’s extremely skeptical about the law’s constitutionality. “By removing a form of identification used by ‘tens of thousands of young voters’ in Indiana, SB 10 makes voting more difficult for student voters than it was before the law was enacted,” Young wrote. “Plaintiffs have alleged facts that plausibly suggest that they are entitled to relief under the First, Fourteenth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments.” For months, voting rights advocates have argued that Senate Bill 10 (SB 10), passed by the GOP-controlled legislature earlier this year, intentionally targeted college students, many of whom lean Democratic, by eliminating their public university-issued IDs as acceptable identification for voting. “Students seeking alternative forms of identification face special barriers at every step of the process,” Young noted. “Obtaining a state ID card from the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (‘BMV’) requires time, travel, and documentation that can be difficult to obtain and that students are significantly less likely to have than older voters.”</span></p>

Maine Rep. Nina Milliken, D-Blue Hill, was charged last month with illegal electioneering, which is when a candidate for office attempts to influence voters too close to the polling location. Irving announced that the evidence in the original report from the Hancock County Sheriff&#8217;s Office included witnesses who did not hear Milliken make unlawful statements, and three witnesses who indicated the legislator&#8217;s statements did violate the law. Irving said Milliken&#8217;s defense attorney spoke with two of the three witnesses who previously indicated Milliken&#8217;s statements were illegal, and it became clear based on those conversations that they were not certain they heard the specific statements that violate Maine law.</span></p>

Javorina admitted to filling out an absentee ballot in the name of her recently deceased mother ahead of the 2024 general election. Javorina, according to court documents, later told an investigator her mother was an “avid Donald Trump supporter” who hoped to vote for the Republican presidential nominee. The fraudulent submission was flagged by election officials before it could be counted. Javorina,  asserted that she has no recollection of mailing the ballots back to the elections office due to intoxication. For that reason, she entered a Norgaard plea to a felony count of signing a false election certificate — acknowledging that the evidence would be sufficient for a judge or jury to find her guilty. The Itasca County Auditor’s Office said it received sealed ballot envelopes containing signatures for both on Oct. 7, 2024. But a routine check of the Minnesota Vital Statistics death report showed that Rose Javorina had died Aug. 31. Javorina will spend up to three years on supervised probation, undergo a psychological evaluation, and pay an $885 fine and any restitution. She agreed to read the book “Thank You for Voting: The Maddening, Enlightening, Inspiring Truth About Voting in America” by Erin Geiger Smith and write a 10-page paper about “the importance of voting in a democracy and how election fraud can undermine the voting process.”</span></p>

Join our panel of cyber security experts as we discuss Issue One’s latest report and hear how partisanship is hamstringing our response to foreign cyber threats. We will hear a first hand example with a short exploration of Congress’ failure to reauthorize the Cyber Infrastructure Security Act of 2015 and the urgent need for a full 10-year reauthorization. Panelists include: Kim Wyman: Former Washington Secretary of State and Senior Election Security Advisor at CISA and current President of Election Security &amp; Innovation Consulting, Patrick J.

From partisan gerrymandering and primary systems that drive polarization to calls for proportional representation and ranked-choice voting, Americans are increasingly debating how electoral structures shape the health of our republic. This event—part of R Street’s 250th Anniversary Series—brings together R Street’s Governance Policy Director, Matthew Germer; political analyst Chris Stirewalt; and legal scholar Walter Olson to explore the landscape of electoral reform and what it means for American democracy at 250. Together, they will examine: How current electoral practices affect representation, accountability, and public trust. The range of reforms under discussion, from proportional representation to ranked-choice voting and beyond. The legal, political, and cultural barriers to reform. How the Founders’ principles—equality, popular sovereignty, and civic virtue—might guide us in strengthening democratic institutions today. A reception will follow to continue the conversation. <strong>When:</strong> October 21. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/npc-headliners-giving-unforgivable-joyce-vance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPC Headliners: “Giving Up Is Unforgivable,” Joyce Vance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance will discuss democracy, civics, and her new book Giving Up Is Unforgivable: A Manual for Keeping a Democracy at a Headliners Book Event on Thursday, October 23 at 6 p.m.  Vance is a former U.S. Attorney under President Barack Obama, now serving as a law professor at the University of Alabama, a legal analyst for MSNBC and NBC, and the author of the popular Substack, Civil Discourse. In Giving Up Is Unforgivable, she delivers a hopeful yet urgent message that merges civic history and practical guidance for preserving democracy. As the voice behind two podcasts and a chart‑topping newsletter, she empowers readers to counter democratic erosion through everyday actions and citizen engagement. Vance&#8217;s message is simple: we’re in this together, and giving up is not an option. The event will include a discussion with the author and a book signing. Ticket prices are $5 for National Press Club members and $10 for general admission. Books are available for pre-purchase. A limited number of books will be available at the event. <strong>When:</strong> October 23. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC. </span></p>

The program will feature back-to-back fireside chats with experts who are advancing participatory governance in communities around the United States. From local democracy forums to grassroots coalitions, panelists will discuss how they are building trust, collectively solving everyday problems, and strengthening civic life at the local level. This interactive conversation will bring together practitioners from inside and outside government who are reimagining how residents and institutions work together. We will explore how culture—our shared norms, stories, and ways of engaging—shapes the practice of democracy, and why that matters more than ever in an era of national polarization and fractured federal infrastructure. Participants will gain insights into innovative approaches that foster belonging, bridge divides, and widen civic participation in decision-making. Whether through public assemblies, co-governance models, or creative community-building, these leaders are showing how democratic culture can be sustained and renewed from the ground up. <strong>When:</strong> October 24. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC. </span></p>
