							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Arizona is Fostering a New Generation of Election Officials through Innovative Fellowship Program</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Christian Grose and Theo Menon</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election official turnover has been</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/election-official-turnover-rates-from-2000-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rising steadily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, creating a recruitment challenge for election offices that must fill increasing large numbers of vacant positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Arizona Secretary of State’s Office is leading the way with an innovative solution: the County Election Administration Fellowship Program. The program sought to address both current staffing shortages and the field’s long-term recruitment issues by hiring young people to work in election administration during the fall 2024 semester. Most fellows were embedded in a county office to work on election administration, and a few fellows worked in the Secretary of State’s office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/the-arizona-fellows-model-developing-the-next-generation-of-the-election-administration-workforce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Elections Group, and the University of Southern California evaluates the effectiveness of the fellowship program with a focus on outcomes related to cultivating interest in careers in election administration and improving voter outreach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key findings include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participation in the program <strong>increased fellows’ interest in pursuing careers in election administration</strong>. Three fellows have already accepted full-time positions in county election offices where they worked during their fellowships.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The fellowship program <strong>led to increased interest in working in government</strong>, not just election administration.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Participation in the fellowship program—including exposure to threats during the 2024 election—<strong>increased fellows’ interest in related fields such as election security, private security, IT, and election law</strong>. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Arizona fellowship program increased election workers’ ability to conduct outreach to voters by <strong>drawing on a younger and more diverse group of workers</strong> than is typically found in the permanent election administration workforce. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Participation in the program <strong>improved fellows’ ability to work with voters across the political spectrum</strong> and <strong>increased their confidence in election outcomes</strong>.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to providing stopgap staffing at county offices, the fellowship program offered a low-cost way to <strong>encourage young people to join the election administration workforce</strong>.  </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona’s fellowship model demonstrates how a relatively small, well-structured program can deliver promising results, including immediate staffing support, sparking long-term interest in election work, and laying the framework for a robust and resilient election workforce to preserve American democracy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For states interested in adopting a similar program, our report also offers several recommendations and considerations:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Define program goals in coordination with local officials</strong>: Clearly define the fellows’ responsibilities and the program’s goals in coordination with local officials to ensure a rich experience that educates fellows and helps address specific needs for county election offices. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Determine how the program will be funded</strong>: The Arizona Secretary of State’s office paid for the fellowship program, ensuring that resource-stretched county election offices did not have to take on additional financial burdens. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Identify a program manager and determine program structure</strong>: A designated program manager at the state level should oversee recruitment of fellows, training, logistics, and coordination with election offices. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Expand recruitment to reach a broader pool of young people</strong>: Seek out applicants from a wide array of academic backgrounds including undergraduate students, graduate students, and nonstudents.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <strong>Consider a pilot program to get started</strong>: Before launching a fellowship program statewide, states should consider a limited pilot program to assess feasibility and to avoid overburdening local election officials. </span></li>

The Associated Press takes a look at one  of the technical changes under the presidential executive order which mandates that voting equipment, it says, should not use ballots that include </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-elections-executive-order-qr-codes-eaa28de62e54463dff116f09e09f7686"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“a barcode or quick-response code.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> National Public Radio has two stories this week on the U.S. Department of Justice. One looks at the affects changes to DOJ are having on staffing in the </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/g-s1-66906/trump-civil-rights-justice-exodus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civil Rights Divisio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">n and the other looks at DOJ’s move to focus on voter fraud with assistance from the </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/17/nx-s1-5383277/trump-doj-doge-noncitizen-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Government Efficiency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On the legislative front, A letter signed by a group of 40 bipartisan state attorneys general called on Congress to reject an “irresponsible” federal measure that would bar states from enforcing their own </span><a href="https://statescoop.com/state-attorneys-general-reject-federal-ai-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laws and regulations governing the use of artificial intelligence systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the next 10 years. The letter from the National Association of Attorneys General said the “broad” state AI moratorium measure rolled into the federal budget reconciliation bill would be “sweeping and wholly destructive of reasonable state efforts to prevent known harms associated with AI.” “This bill does not propose any regulatory scheme to replace or supplement the laws enacted or currently under consideration by the states, leaving Americans entirely unprotected from the potential harms of AI,” the letter read. “Moreover, this bill purports to wipe away any state-level frameworks already in place. Imposing a broad moratorium on all state action while Congress fails to act in this area is irresponsible and deprives consumers of reasonable protections.”</span></p>

Like many springtime “off year” elections, the story making headlines was overall low turnout. In <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/idaho-low-voter-turnout-may-election/277-ceb8a200-6260-48e5-a10b-a01c4fcfde65">Idaho</a>, turnout was around 13% of registered voters, according to preliminary data from the Secretary of State&#8217;s office. &#8220;These May elections always are a little bit lower turnout,&#8221; Secretary of State Phil McGrane said. &#8220;A lot of people weren&#8217;t necessarily sure what they were voting on. These are hyperlocal elections. So, we had highway districts, library districts, sewer districts, water districts &#8230; probably what drew the most attention, though, were bonds and levies.&#8221; In <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/politics/elections/low-voter-turnout-oregon-special-election/283-2e830e34-3df1-44b5-b959-a62417735595">Oregon</a>, where voters decided on a range of local measures, including school board races, infrastructure bonds, public safety levies, and education funding, turnout was roughly 20%. Voters finished voting on Tuesday in <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2025/pa-primary-elections-relatively-calm-and-successful-top-election-official-says/">Pennsylvania</a> and Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt said that “it’s been a relatively calm and successful primary election day,”. <a href="https://www.butlereagle.com/20250520/digital-poll-pads-garner-positive-reactions-in-test-precincts/">Butler County</a> Bureau of Elections successfully introduced e-poll books at one precinct in Franklin Township. The <a href="https://www.citizensvoice.com/2025/05/20/election-free-of-problems-in-luzerne-county/">Luzerne County</a> Bureau of Elections conducted problem-free elections County Manager Romilda Crocamo said after polls closed. “We had a very good day here in Luzerne County,” Crocamo said. “I want to commend the staff. It was really a joint effort between the election bureau, we had other staff members and of course the sheriffs are here. At one point, I went into the bureau, and the phones weren’t ringing at all. I love the sound of that silence. It was a good day, and I have to applaud the staff.” Election workers in <a href="https://www.lehighvalleynews.com/elections/primary-election-day-dawns-with-thin-voter-turnout-early-on">Lehigh and Northampton counties</a> reported no major issues during the day. But no election would be complete without a gas issue. A polling place in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2025/05/20/mount-rise-polling-place-shut-down/stories/202505200101">Allegheny County</a> was shut down and moved to a new location after officials reported the smell of natural gas in the area. “A quiet day like today is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our county election officials, especially those new ones who are running elections for the first time and have done their part to make sure voters in their counties can cast their ballot and make their voice heard,” Schmidt said.</span></p>

Emily Cook, an Ohio artist </span><a href="https://myfox28columbus.com/news/local/image-used-without-permission-ohio-voted-sticker-in-copyright-controversy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claims that her &#8220;Ohio Voted&#8221; sticker design has been used by the state of Louisiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without her permission. Cook, who designed the sticker for Ohio voters, noticed a similar design on Louisiana&#8217;s website. Cook won a 2019 design contest conducted by the Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose. Her winning image states the words &#8220;OHIO VOTED&#8221; within the shape of Ohio and bordered by red and blue circles. &#8220;I was just shocked. I was shocked. I said flabbergasted, I think,&#8221; said Cook regarding Louisiana&#8217;s similar design, pattern, and coloring. &#8220;Did they ask somebody&#8217;s permission? How long has it been circulating? Is it just online?&#8221; ABC6 Investigates <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12896" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-22-at-11.10.58 AM-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />reached out to the Louisiana Secretary of State&#8217;s office several times for an explanation. No one from the Louisiana Office has responded to say where they obtained the image. [Editor’s Note: As “I Voted” sticker scholars, we can chime in here and note that while the artwork may be appearing online, it’s </span><a href="https://www.wwno.org/politics/2024-11-01/who-is-the-artist-behind-the-crawfish-on-louisianas-i-voted-sticker"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOT the sticker that Louisianans got when they cast their ballots in 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We also were unable to find out where exactly the image is being used on the Louisiana elections website, although a page where you should be able to download an “I Voted” sticker comes up with an error.] The Louisiana secretary of state’s office did not respond to a reporter’s inquiry and the Ohio secretary of state’s office sent WSYX the following statement: &#8220;Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Ohio sets the national standard for election integrity, and apparently for ‘I Voted’ sticker designs too.&#8221;</span></p>

As a matter of fact, today we are going to give these people a tour, a backroom tour of our office here,” said Supervisor of Elections Craig Latimer. Latimer said the “Future Voter” sticker will be given out not only on election day but throughout the year. “We do a lot of registration events and public displays around the entire county, and we always take the stickers with us, and they are a hot item. The little ones love the stickers. They want to put them all over themselves, so it’s always a good time,” said Latimer.</span></p>

Bills don’t expire at the end of the first year of the two-year legislative session, but</span><a href="https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/34?Root=SB%2064"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 64</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needed to become law this year in order to be implemented in time for the 2026 election. Among the changes in the bill: Speedier ballot counting, better tracking of absentee ballots, ballot dropboxes across the state, free return postage for absentee ballots, a liaison to help fix voting issues in rural Alaska, permanent absentee ballot registration, a method to fix paperwork problems after an absentee ballot is cast, the elimination of the requirement that a “witness” sign a voter’s absentee ballot, and additional security audits. Many of the House’s Republicans objected to the bill, saying that they believe it did not do enough to address their concerns about election security. The Senate passed SB 64 on May 12, but Rep. Neal Foster, D-Nome and co-chair of the House Finance Committee said that House Republicans were prepared to offer so many amendments to the bill that it would have required members of the House to abandon all other work in order to push the bill across the finish line. Even then, it could have been vetoed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican.</span></p>

The bill is sponsored by Rep. August Pfluger (R-TX) and has earned the co-sponsorship of at least 14 other House Republicans, including Reps. Nancy Mace (R-SC), Byron Donalds (R-FL), and Lauren Boebert (R-CO). Democrats and District officials have shown opposition in the past to the bill, which passed the House last year with most Republicans voting “aye” and 52 Democrats voting in favor. The Senate never put the bill to a vote. “Over the past two years, our residents have repeatedly suffered the indignity of having politicians elected elsewhere — politicians who aren’t accountable to District residents — attempt to usurp the authority of our elected officials,” District of Columbia Council Chairman Phil Mendelson and Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb, both Democrats, wrote in a letter to House leadership ahead of the initial vote, which denied the bill’s passage before the second vote succeeded.</span></p>

Vaughn of Common Cause said the voting advocates are concerned the additional political personnel “will try to overstep what the law allows them to do and interfere in the administration of the election.” </span><a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2025/bills/senate/287/details"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Enrolled Act 287</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which turns school board elections into partisan contests by requiring candidates to affiliate with a political party (Republican, Democrat or Independent) or chose to run as a nonpartisan. </span><a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2025/bills/house/1680/details"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Enrolled Act 1680</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which requires county registration officials to request proof of citizenship from any individual who registers to vote using a temporary credential issued by the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles.</span></p>

Americans for Citizen Voting won unanimous support from the board May 16 for a 99-word summary of its new ballot initiative, and can soon begin collecting the nearly 450,000 signatures from registered voters that are required to get the question on the 2026 ballot. The proof-of-citizenship proposal from ACV, a product of the Virginia-based libertarian Liberty Initiative Fund, follows another one from the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights, which won unanimous board approval last month for the summary of its proposal. According to Votebeat, the two initiatives are similar: Both would require new voters — and possibly currently registered voters — to prove their U.S. citizenship, , and both would eliminate the option for voters who lack a photo ID to sign an affidavit attesting to their identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3833" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MN-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Minnesota:</strong> With about 90 minutes to spare on the last evening of the regular legislative session, House and Senate members passed a conference committee report that would provide funding for not only legislative operations, but the executive branch as well. Local government and </span><a href="https://www.house.mn.gov/sessiondaily/Story/18813"><span style="font-weight: 400;">elections provisions are in there, too</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Without discussion, the conference committee for the omnibus state and local government and elections bill signed off around 8 p.m. on a $1.35 billion spending package for the 2026-27 biennium, a $46.5 million increase over base. Senate approval came 36-31 a couple hours later; the House followed shortly thereafter with a 116-18 vote. Elections spending in the bill totals $3.86 million in biennial spending, with a majority — $1.81 million in fiscal year 2026 and $1.84 million in fiscal year 2027 — going to the Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board. Additionally, the agreement would change many aspects of absentee voting in Minnesota. In part, applicants would be required to provide both a Minnesota driver’s license or state identification card number and the last four digits of their Social Security number to verify identity; mailed and online absentee ballot applications would need to be received at least five days before an election; and counties would need to develop a chain of custody plan for handling election-related materials, including absentee ballots.</span></p>

At least five similar bills filed this session by Democratic lawmakers did not get committee hearings. The one that got a hearing on May 15 is championed by state Rep. John Bucy, an Austin Democrat.</span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB311"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 311</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would direct the Texas Secretary of State’s Office to work with the Texas Department of Public Safety and the state’s Department of Information Resources to implement online voter registration. Bucy acknowledged the bill’s slim chances, but told Votebeat that the hearing was a significant step toward implementing online voter registration in Texas. “I’ve met with my colleagues over the years. I’ve met with the Secretary of State’s Office to learn the logistics of it,” Bucy said. “It seems like the appetite for it is growing.” He has filed the legislation every year since he took office in 2019. “I want people to have a fresh lens at looking at online voter registration,” he said. “Forty states have done it. They’ve done it because it’s efficient, because it’s safe and it’s accurate, and that’s what we should be doing here in Texas.” Texas, which has more than 18 million registered voters, is one of only eight states without online voter registration.</span></p>

Sponsored by Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara, Sen. Steve Nass, and Rep. Scott Krug, the bill seeks to address disparities in voting access between urban and rural areas. In recent elections, early voting has surged in popularity. On the first day of early voting for the November 4th election, nearly 100,000 Wisconsinites voted, setting a record, according to a press release. The proposal includes a 20-hour minimum for in-person absentee voting without prior appointment. A funding mechanism to support municipalities in meeting this minimum will be proposed. Lawmakers emphasize that this step will help reduce congestion and error on Election Day.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5257" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MI-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Michigan:</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court this week turned away a petition by 11 Republican Michigan legislators who </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/michigan/2025/05/20/scotus-rejected-lawmakers-lawsuits-voting-rights-erick-kaardal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sought to overturn expanded voting measures </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">enacted through statewide ballot initiatives, bringing an end to the federal case known as Lindsey v. Whitmer. The federal case was always a longshot, experts told Votebeat when it was first brought before the Supreme Court, which hears only about 150 of the thousands of requests it gets each year. According to Votebeat, the justices denied the lawmakers’ petition without comment. But their attorney, conservative legal activist Erick Kaardal, told lawmakers that he’s not done trying to challenge the election measures, which include no-reason absentee voting, and straight-party voting, passed as part of 2018’s Proposal 3, as well as early voting and ballot drop boxes from Proposal 2 in 2022. The plaintiffs in the case are a group of Michigan lawmakers, not the Legislature itself. Several federal courts have shot down the case for lack of standing, challenging the plaintiffs’ right to sue as individual lawmakers. “Fortunately, the Michigan Supreme Court has held that individual state legislator standing exists … so we’ll continue pursuing that angle in state courts,” Kaardal said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5534" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NJ-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />New Jersey</strong>: Hudson County Superior Court Assignment Judge David Katz granted an order to show cause in a lawsuit brought forth by two 33rd Legislative District Assembly candidates </span><a href="https://hudsoncountyview.com/judge-grants-order-to-show-cause-in-ld-33-lawsuit-seeking-waterfront-voting-sites/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking waterfront voting sites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The candidates filed a one-count lawsuit in Hudson County Superior Court on May 8th seeking three in-person voting locations on River Road, as well as one early voting site. The Hudson County Board of Elections, who are arguing that statutory deadlines have passed to allow for further polling sites, are represented by Deputy New Jersey Attorney General Craig S. Keiser. ” … Redistricting is not possible at this juncture as the deadline for any redistricting in advance of an election is 82 days prior to the primary election, March 20, 2025. Clearly, that deadline for redistricting has passed and the Board is not permitted to redistrict now,” he wrote in a letter to the court on May 13. “Moreover, even if redistricting was ordered outside the statutory deadline, such cannot be implemented for the June 2025 Primary Election, which is already underway with mail-in ballots having been sent to voters approximately three weeks ago and some already having been returned cast by voters.” Keiser further stated that only municipalities are permitted by law to recommend polling locations and that deadline passed on April 1st. Through that process, the board of elections added three polling locations in North Bergen and one in Weehawken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3528" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/OhioFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Ohio:</strong> James Saunders, 56, of Shaker Heights was convicted last week of voting multiple times in the last two general elections, was</span><a href="https://www.clevescene.com/news/shaker-heights-trump-supporter-convicted-of-voter-fraud-gets-three-years-in-prison-42641089"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sentenced to three years in prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a judge has ruled. Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Andrew Santoli coupled Saunders&#8217; sentence with a $10,000 fine, a punishment, as Santoli detailed in last week&#8217;s hearing, to match the severe violation against the nation&#8217;s voting laws.  &#8220;You violated the premise that every citizen, regardless of race, creed or religion, speaks in one voice,&#8221; Santoli told Saunders from the bench. &#8220;Your opinion does not outweigh other citizens.&#8221; Throughout the case, the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor&#8217;s Office presented evidence that Saunders, who traveled regularly to a second home in Pompano Beach, Florida, attempted to cross states lines to vote multiple times, by mail and in person in Broward and Cuyahoga counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3609" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/TexasFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Texas:</strong> Prosecutors </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/charges-dropped-conservative-activist-texas-false-voter-fraud-122010964"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dropped charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Dr. Steven Hotze, 74, a prominent conservative activist related to allegations he had been part of what authorities have called a baseless voter fraud conspiracy theory in which a man was run off the road and held at gunpoint over claims he was holding fraudulent voter ballots. Hotze had been facing four charges related to allegedly helping plan an assault against an air conditioner repairman in October 2020. Prosecutors alleged the repairman was run off the road and held at gunpoint by Mark Aguirre, a former Houston police officer. Aguirre had worked for a firm hired by Liberty Center for God and Country, a nonprofit organization that Hotze runs, to pursue a voter fraud investigation. Aguirre had claimed the repairman was the mastermind of the voter fraud scheme and that the man’s truck had been filled with fraudulent ballots when Aguirre ran his SUV into it, according to authorities. Police who responded to the incident searched the repairman’s truck and found only air conditioning parts and tools, prosecutors said. Hotze was charged with four counts — aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, engaging in organized crime and unlawful restraint. The Harris County District Attorney’s Office dropped all four counts against Hotze and three of the five counts against Aguirre, who is still facing charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and unlawful restraint. “This deeply troubling case shows how toxic conspiracy theories can fuel real-world violence that endangers people in our community,” Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare said in a statement. “We look forward to vigorously prosecuting the remaining charges in this case that stand up to legal scrutiny.”</span></p>
