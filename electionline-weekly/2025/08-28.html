</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 800 attend Election Center’s 40th Annual Conference</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><a href="http://electionline.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13170" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC40th-300x109.png" alt="" width="300" height="109" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC40th-300x109.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC40th-1024x373.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC40th-768x280.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC40th.png 1054w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The year was 1985. The top song for the year was</span><a href="https://youtu.be/izGwDsrQ1eQ?si=JHrS8zK0tnrcMjCL"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Careless Whisper”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Wham,</span><a href="https://youtu.be/qvsgGtivCgs?si=T4bcdDjo7P_KBwQW"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Back to the Future”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the number one grossing movie and</span><a href="https://youtu.be/TkFHYODzRTs?si=QfcW7oLMTMnzpBWp"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Live Aid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the event of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also that year, elections officials from all over the country gathered in New Orleans for Election Center’s first Annual Conference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the song of the summer is </span><a href="https://youtu.be/u2ah9tWTkmk?si=U0jrWVKPi1GmqjyR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ordinary&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Alex Warren [so says Spotify], the top grossing movie so far is </span><a href="https://youtu.be/8B1EtVPBSMw?si=L5DJLBCG7iY2PkRT"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A Minecraft Movie”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span>the event of the year was clearly the Election Center’s 40th Annual Conference in Salt Lake City from August 20-22 where more than 800 elections officials, vendors, academics and others gathered to learn, trauma bond and have a bit of fun.</p>
<div id="attachment_13332" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13332" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-13332" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC2025A-300x212.png" alt="" width="300" height="212" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC2025A-300x212.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC2025A-768x542.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC2025A.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-13332" class="wp-caption-text">Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson. <em>Election Center photo by Karl Dukstein.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the conference technically didn’t kick off until Thursday morning, Wednesday was jam-packed with pre-conference events including committee meetings, a hands-on workshop and training on Artificial Intelligence from the folks at Microsoft and The Elections Group and for the first time ever a CLE course covering requests for election data and equipment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also on Wednesday, about 300 people went on a tour of the </span><a href="https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/clerk/elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salt Lake County Clerk’s elections division</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the state capitol where participants got to hear from Lt. Gov. Diedre Henderson, who is the state’s chief election official.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_13327" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13327" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-13327" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC2025H-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC2025H-300x200.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC2025H.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-13327" class="wp-caption-text">Hands on learning about AI. <em>Election Center photo by Karl Dukstein.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henderson spoke about suffrage in Utah. Utah was the first state to allow a woman to vote. </span><a href="https://utahwomenshistory.org/the-women/seraph-young/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seraph Young Ford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who cast her ballot in municipal elections on Valentine’s Day 1870. Henderson also spoke about Utah’s current voting system and her career path. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference officially kicked off on Thursday with keynote speakers Ben Ginsberg and Bob Bauer.  Bauer and Ginsberg first served together on the </span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/the-presidential-commission-on-election-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presidential Commission on Election Administration </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which was created by Executive Order by President Barack Obama in 2013. They now serve as co-chairs of the </span><a href="https://pillarsofthecommunity.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pillars of the Community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which seeks to bolster faith in elections by hosting conversations between a group of politically diverse community leaders and election officials about the ongoing work at the state and local levels to deliver an election that meets voter expectations of reliability and security. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday morning also featured plenary sessions from the League of Conservative Election Officials on staying true </span>to your values in trying times and a session on elections funding from some of the folks involved with the <a href="https://electionline.org/resources/bolstering-funding-and-practices-for-resilient-elections/">Bolstering Funding and Practices for Resilient Elections</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday afternoon and Friday were filled with more than 30 breakout sessions covering topics ranging from security and technology to communications and outreach to management, training and logistics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All presentations will be available to Election Center members via the resources section of their member profile in the coming days. </span></p>

</span></p>
<div id="attachment_13322" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13322" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-13322" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC2025B-300x242.png" alt="" width="300" height="242" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC2025B-300x242.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC2025B-768x619.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EC2025B.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-13322" class="wp-caption-text">The sticker swap is always a highlight. <em>Election Center photo by Karl Dukstein.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Friday luncheon, 140 Certified Elections/Registration Administrators (CERA), Election Center&#8217;s largest graduate class ever, graduated from the certification program in a ceremony honoring this achievement. CERA certification is the highest professional achievement for election officials and vendors in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CERA graduates achieve this designation through a multi-year course of study taught by Auburn University’s Master in Public Administration (MPA) faculty in partnership with Election Center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Election Center congratulates the 2025 CERA graduates on the outstanding accomplishment of attaining CERA certification,” said Kathleen Hale, executive director of Election Center. “We commend this latest cohort of election officials for completing the CERA curriculum. This professional development milestone is a testament to their commitment to serving their respective voters and to free and fair elections.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were nearly 100 graduates on hand at the conference to receive their certificates in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The CERA program is deeply meaningful to me. It provided essential training to strengthen election integrity and build relationships, empowering me to serve my community with confidence. This program enhances my skills, fosters trust in democracy, and equips me to ensure fair, efficient elections, making a lasting impact,” said Joshua Dickard, Charleston County, South Carolina. </span></p>

The money comes from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant program, and voting officials say new requirements from the administration will make the money inaccessible for most of the country. About $28 million — or 3% of the overall </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/22/nx-s1-5508345/election-security-grants-trump-voting-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeland Security Grant Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — is devoted to election security and now at risk, though some officials and experts worry that the new requirements could also endanger hundreds of millions of dollars in other grants for law enforcement. The grant money in question is administered within DHS by FEMA, and is meant to help state and local governments prepare for and prevent terrorism and disasters. Heather Honey, a prominent election activist whose research questioned the 2020 election results is now working in an election-related leadership position at the U.S. </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2025/08/26/heather-honey-election-activist-hired-department-of-homeland-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Homeland Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Honey is now listed as a deputy assistant secretary for election integrity, according to an organizational chart on the DHS website. Her hiring was first reported by Democracy Docket. Deputy assistant secretaries are often involved in drafting executive orders and crafting policies, and serve as liaisons to the White House and the National Security Council, ProPublica reported. The </span><a href="https://www.campusreform.org/article/trump-administration-ends-biden-era-rule-funding-poll-workers-student-aid/28506"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced on August 19 that colleges may no longer use Federal Work Study (FWS) funds to employ students in political activities, rolling back a policy that allowed taxpayer dollars to pay students serving as poll workers, voter hotline staff, or in voter registration drives. In its new guidance, the department said institutions are prohibited from using FWS funds “to employ students whose work involves any partisan or nonpartisan political activity.” The agency classified jobs such as poll workers, voter assistance staff, and those supporting voting legislation as ineligible because “these activities support the process of voting which is a quintessential political activity.” At the same time, the department reiterated that schools must continue to make a “good faith” effort to distribute voter registration forms to students. It also directed institutions to implement “proper controls” to ensure that no FWS-funded positions involve political work.</span></p>

Not surprisingly,  Democrats and Republicans continue to hold starkly different views: Today, 83% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents support no-excuse voting by mail, while 68% of Republicans and Republican leaners oppose it. Several other proposals related to the U.S. electoral system win widespread support across the political spectrum, according to a new Pew Research Center survey of 3,554 adults conducted Aug. 4-10, prior to President Donald Trump’s  announcement to end mail voting. Among the most-supported proposals:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requiring electronic voting machines to print a paper backup of a voter’s ballot (84% in favor)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requiring all voters to show government-issued photo identification (83%)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making early, in-person voting available for at least two weeks prior to the election (80%)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making Election Day a federal holiday (74%) </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of these draws support from majorities in both partisan coalitions. Of the 10 proposals included in the survey, just two are more opposed by Americans than favored:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">52% oppose banning groups from collecting completed ballots from a large number of voters to return them to election officials. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">56% oppose removing people from registration lists if they haven’t voted recently or responded to efforts to confirm their registration and address.</span></li>

This week the secretary of state’s office held the first of six public demonstrations by companies that hope to compete for the contract for the new voting system. While each is different, they all must comply with requirements state lawmakers established in 2021 — and that includes the use of paper ballots. Diane Foster, a Rapides Parish election commissioner, has been using the current system for more than 20 years and was eager to be part of the testing group.  “I knew we kept talking about getting something new, so I wanted to be in on the ground floor of what the possibilities are,” </span><a href="https://www.wafb.com/2025/08/26/demonstrations-new-voting-systems-underway/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Foster. In addition to the paper trail, the 2021 law mandates several other requirements, such as using machines with “tamper-evident seals” and a prohibition against voting equipment that connects to the internet. “We want our voting machines to actually have a paper ballot component so that we can audit both the machine tabulations and the paper trail,” said Catherine Newsome, first assistant secretary of state.</span></p>

The challenge arises from magnets not sticking to cars, prompting concerns about election integrity. The office rents various cars for tasks such as courier services and delivering voting equipment, many of which are from out-of-state. This situation necessitates clear identification of these vehicles. Recorder Gabrielle Cazares-Kelly emphasized the importance of transparency in this matter. &#8220;The way they&#8217;re manufactured now they aren&#8217;t using metal on the outside,&#8221; said Cazares-Kelly. This manufacturing change renders some magnets purchased by the office unusable, which Cazares-Kelly finds peculiar. &#8220;It is one of those interesting things,&#8221; Cazares-Kelly told KVOA &#8220;If we don&#8217;t have those magnets on the side&#8230; people question who are these people and why are they coming in from out-of-state,&#8221; said Cazares-Kelly. Efforts to resolve this issue are ongoing. &#8220;We&#8217;re still trying to figure that out &#8211; we&#8217;re troubleshooting a few ideas,&#8221; said Cazares-Kelly. One possible solution being considered is the use of window clings instead of magnets.</span></p>

The number of elections-related bills and resolutions surpasses the total for 2022, 2023, and 2024. There are more than 500 new laws, nearing the most for any year in that time period. As in previous years, Republican lawmakers and Republican trifecta states are driving most of this activity. This trend reflects both their advantage in legislative control—holding majorities in 57 of the 99 state legislative chambers—and greater control of state governments in general, with 23</span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/State_government_trifectas"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trifectas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared to 15 for Democrats.

However, according to Honolulu Civil Beat,  it’s far from certain whether those actions will ever be approved by the full commission, which conducted an acrimonious meeting this week. The recommendations come after another three-member subcommittee found discrepancies in the 2024 Kauaʻi County general election results, in which the state counted more ballots than the county said it delivered. This week, the full commission voted 5-2 to conduct an independent audit of the Kauaʻi County results. The commission has scheduled a Sept. 24 meeting to address the findings of the second investigation, this one focused on possible election malfeasance and recommending the firing of Hawaiʻi Chief Elections Officer Scott Nago and a return to in-person voting on paper ballots. The malfeasance report also calls for an “external, independent manual audit” of all mail ballot envelopes and ballots, as well USPS receipts “to reconcile ballot discrepancies” in the general election. The Elections Commission has hiring and firing authority for the chief elections officer, but mail-in balloting was established by the Hawaiʻi Legislature beginning with the 2020 election.</span></p>

Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, and Sen. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, told the Interim Joint Committee Local Government that their legislation would exclude people convicted of treason, election-related crimes, sexual offenses and crimes against children.  A spokesman for Senate Democrats said the legislation has “not yet been drafted, as the details are still being worked out.” Higdon said the language will be “pretty much identical” to previous versions of the bill. “It has been my belief that once someone has been convicted of a crime, they do their time and they come out, that a part of them coming out and being a citizen and being whole is that they should be able to vote again,” Herron said.  Herron and Higdon’s amendment would relate only to voting rights, not other civil rights lost, such as the ability to run for office. </span></p>

Board of Elections vote this week. The Board is asking people who do not have a driver’s license number or partial Social Security number connected to their name to supply one of those identifiers.  For certain voters, those identifying numbers may not be attached to their names as a result of a mismatch. If a name is misspelled, if voters change their names, if the numbers on a birth date are transposed, or one record has a middle name and another record doesn’t, for example, the numerical identifiers aren’t added to the voter registration file. The three Republicans on the five-member Board voted to approve the plan that will require those voters who don’t have those identifiers connected to their names to cast provisional ballots and show an acceptable picture ID or document showing their residence when they vote. Additionally, Republicans on the Board flexed their new majority by rejecting plans for Sunday voting in Davidson and Union counties during early voting this year. Democrats on the Board wanted to allow Sunday voting in those counties. The State Board put off discussion of whether it will feed voter information into the federal SAVE database that agencies use to verify immigration status and citizenship.  The Department of Homeland Security asked the Board if it wanted to be part of a “soft launch” that allows states to submit voter information, including the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, to check immigration and citizenship status.</span></p>

Greg Abbott called on lawmakers to prohibit </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/texas/2025/08/25/governor-greg-abbott-bill-ban-election-day-voter-registration-changes-polling-place/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same-day voter registration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in an apparent attempt to reverse a measure passed earlier this year that relaxed rules for voters who made last-minute updates to their addresses. Texas does not allow same-day registration for new applicants, but under the legislation passed this year with bipartisan support,</span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB2217"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 2217</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, voters could update their addresses and immediately cast a ballot based on their new precinct or district, as long as the move was within the county. That law was scheduled to go into effect Sept. 1. Shortly after Abbott’s announcement, state Rep. Briscoe Cain, a Republican from East Texas, announced on social media that he had filed a bill that would effectively prevent that measure from going into effect. Cain’s bill would maintain the status quo, in which voters can update their address at the polls, but have to wait 30 days for that change to take effect. Their ballot would include races tied to their old address, the one on file in the state voter registration system before the update.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House sent a measure to Abbott’s desk that would let the attorney general’s office </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/26/texas-attorney-general-prosecute-election-crimes-bill-abbott/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">independently prosecute election-related crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, years after the state’s highest criminal court ruled the office could not do so without an invitation from local prosecutors. Members of the Legislature’s lower chamber voted 85–54 to pass</span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=892&amp;Bill=SB12"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 12</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, and Republican Rep. Matt Shaheen of Plano, after a roughly hourlong debate that centered on the constitutionality of the measure. Four years ago, the all-GOP Court of Criminal Appeals ruled the attorney general’s office could not unilaterally prosecute election crimes — such as voter fraud — due to the separation of powers clause of the Texas Constitution. Democratic lawmakers who opposed SB 12 grilled Shaheen about the bill’s constitutionality, considering the ruling. Shaheen insisted that the bill would “fix” the ruling from the state’s highest court for criminal matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican-led House approved a </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/texas/2025/08/21/republicans-texas-house-congressional-map-redistricting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new congressional map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> crafted to hand five additional U.S. House seats to the GOP, over fierce opposition from Democrats, who cast the plan as a racially discriminatory attempt by President Donald Trump to stack the deck in next year’s midterm election. The House adopted the map, 88 to 52, along party lines. A Senate panel advanced a similar map earlier in the week.Republicans have said the new districts were drawn purely to maximize their partisan advantage, arguing that the GOP’s margins of victory in 2024 supported new lines that entrenched their hold on power. They have also framed the effort as a response to Democratic gerrymandering elsewhere. Rep. Todd Hunter, R-Corpus Christi, the map’s sponsor, emphasized in laying out</span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=892&amp;Bill=HB4"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Republicans were legally permitted to pursue redistricting in the middle of the decade and to maximize partisan gain.</span></p>

Manasco blocked the state from using the current map in the 2026 elections and said a new map must be put in place that creates a new district in Montgomery where Black voters “comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it.&#8221; As for the Alabama State Senate seats in question, Manasco ruled,  “The appropriate remedy is a redistricting plan that includes either an additional majority-Black Senate district in the Montgomery area, or an additional district there in which Black voters otherwise have an opportunity to elect a senator of their choice,” Manasco wrote in the 261-page ruling.

The request comes amid concerns that the 17 people in question – all of whom county election officials say have been purged from voter rolls – could’ve improperly voted after their names showed up on rolls, despite not being eligible to vote. The lawsuit came after federal prosecutors rejected the county’s proposal to hand over redacted files that included the voters’ names and home addresses, with County Counsel Leon Page arguing it would be illegal to hand over without a court order. But Supervisors Don Wagner and Janet Nguyen – the two Republicans on the board – argued they should not block the request by the federal government, and that it makes people raise questions.  But the three Democrats on the board – Chairman Doug Chaffee, Supervisor Katrina Foley and Supervisor Vicente Sarmiento – pushed back on their colleagues, voting against their colleagues’ proposal to settle the lawsuit. Supervisors Vicente Sarmiento and Doug Chaffee also voted against ending the lawsuit, with Chaffee raising concerns about violating the 17 individuals’ right to privacy.  </span></p>

The judge declined to hold any of the commissioners in criminal contempt of court, but ordered that the board of commissioners must pay the Fulton County Republican Party’s legal fees in the case. While normally the fees would be paid to the county government, Emerson said the fines would instead be paid to the superior court clerk and transferred to the state of Georgia. The Democratic-led board of commissioners voted 5-2 to reject the nominations, citing concerns about Adams and Frazier’s past actions and arguing that they were not qualified for the position. In June, the Fulton County Republican Party filed a lawsuit in Fulton County Superior Court, claiming that commissioners do not have the power to reject nominations from political parties. In an Aug. 3 ruling, Emerson sided with the Fulton County Republican Party, ordering the commissioners to approve the nominations. “There is nothing in the statute to support the BOC theory that the county commissioners can veto the chairperson’s nominees other than for failure of the nominee to meet the two qualifications and one restriction,” Emerson wrote.</span></p>

Callais, a lawsuit that non-Black voters filed over a second majority Black district for the state in the U.S. House, address whether the legislature’s creation of that district violated the 14th 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The 14th Amendment, in part, covers representation in Congress, and the 15th Amendment prevents citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their race. If the justices determine Louisiana violated the Constitution, it could undermine the Voting Rights Act. The legislation was approved in 1965 to bolster protections granted in the 14th and 15th amendments. It has been amended five times since then to strengthen its provisions, though voting rights advocates note federal court rulings over the past decade have chipped away at the law. The state drew a second majority Black district in 2024 in response to a federal judge ruling the state violated the Voting Rights Act with its 2022 map, which kept a single Black-majority district among Louisiana’s six U.S. House seats. Attorney General Liz Murrill, who previously defended the second Black district,now argues that adding another Black district was unconstitutional. </span></p>

The most recent dismissal came Aug. 6 in the case against Douglas Kempkens Jr., a voter who was charged with one count each of voting absentee and in-person and offering to vote more than once. Macomb County Circuit Judge Joseph Toia dismissed and closed the case. A claim of appeal was filed this week with the state appellate court, according to a check Aug. 21 of online court records. According to the Detroit Free Press, AG Spokesman Danny Wimmer indicated in an Aug. 15 email: &#8220;Maintaining free and fair elections is predicated on the premise that citizens can cast their ballot once and only once per election. To allow some people to vote twice makes a mockery of our electoral systems.&#8221; He indicated the office was evaluating its appellate options after recent dismissals. The voters were accused of committing election fraud when they sent in an absentee ballot and still voted in person at the polls, Attorney General Dana Nessel said at a news conference announcing the charges in October. The election workers were accused of knowing of the voters&#8217; absentee ballots — an electronic voter information tracking system informed them — and letting them vote anyway. The AG&#8217;s Office identified the election workers as assistant clerks, but St. Clair Shores Mayor Kip Walby previously told the Free Press they were seasonal workers, not assistant clerks.</span></p>

SB 287 requires anyone seeking to vote by absentee ballot to show photo identification in person or have their absentee ballot application form notarized. While the law was meant to prevent voter fraud, the burden of the law will fall on the most vulnerable, the lawsuit claims. The law requires voters to show such proof for every local, primary and general election in order to receive an absentee ballot. Plaintiffs Adele Robertson of Exeter and Regina Wilson of Brentwood are visually impaired; Daniel Frye of Concord is blind. All are regular absentee voters. Ayotte signed the bill into law along with 42 other bills on Aug. 1 with no public statement. The defendants are listed as Secretary of State David Scanlan and Attorney General John Formella. No response had been filed in court as of press time. The plaintiffs seek to have a judge issue an injunction to halt the new absentee ballot requirements.</span></p>

State lawmakers added the rule to the two-year transportation budget − passed in March − that allocates funding for airports, roads and bridges. Under the budget change, registrars can only offer voter registration to people who have proof of U.S. citizenship or previously provided documents to the BMV. Ohio already requires proof of legal presence to get a driver&#8217;s license or state ID and puts &#8220;noncitizen&#8221; labels on the IDs of those without citizenship. That means people in the BMV database confirmed to be U.S. citizens wouldn&#8217;t need to do anything more. But the lawsuit, filed Aug. 22 in the U.S. District Court&#8217;s Northern Ohio District, contends it will make registration difficult for new Ohio residents, older Ohioans and women who change their name for a marriage or divorce. The suit also noted that Ohioans who register online or by mail need only attest to their citizenship in a sworn statement. &#8220;There is no evidence in Ohio (or any other state) that the attestation requirement has been insufficient in preventing noncitizens from voting,&#8221; the complaint stated. &#8220;The substantial criminal and immigration consequences that a noncitizen would incur from voting have long effectively prevented noncitizens from voting in U.S. elections.&#8221; The suit was filed by Elias Law Group on behalf of the Ohio Alliance for Retired Americans and Red Wine and Blue, an advocacy group led by suburban women.</span></p>

The judges found the dating requirement to be a minimal burden on voters, but said there was not a sufficient state interest to justify enforcing it. “Weighing the burden that practice imposes on Pennsylvanians’ constitutional right to vote against the State’s interest in the practice, the balance of the scales leads us to hold that it does not comply with our Constitution,” the judges</span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.124786/gov.uscourts.ca3.124786.147.0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concluded unanimously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, upholding a decision earlier this year from a federal district court judge. Act 77, the 2019 law that created no-excuse mail voting in Pennsylvania, says a person must sign and date the mail ballot return envelope for their vote to be counted, but election officials have said this date is not used for determining whether the ballot was received by Election Day. Since then, some Pennsylvania counties have rejected thousands of ballots because the envelopes lacked a proper date, and counties have had varying policies about whether to notify voters and give them a chance to correct the error. The validity of the dating requirement has been disputed for years, with state and federal courts going back and forth.</span></p>

Redistricting usually happens at the start of the decade after U.S. census data comes out. The complaint argues that because the new map was drawn based on the same data used for the initial map passed by the Legislature in 2021, the measure was a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause. “Even if racial and partisan considerations are an unavoidable part of redistricting, there is no need for legislatures to take those considerations into account a second time in a single decade,” the complaint reads. The complaint, which is expected to be followed by others targeting</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/22/texas-congressional-redistricting-map-senate-governor-desk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was filed by two law firms on behalf of 13 Texas residents collectively called “the Gonzales plaintiffs.” The bulk of their argument is that the new congressional map “dismantles majority-minority districts” by prioritizing Republican representation in Congress.</span></p>

Gibson ruled that the Republican-controlled body circumvented safeguards put in place by voters to ensure districts aren’t drawn to favor any party. The current map, adopted in 2021, divides Salt Lake County — Utah&#8217;s population center and a Democratic stronghold — among the state’s four congressional districts, all of which have since elected Republicans by wide margins. Gibson made few judgments on the content of the map but declared it unlawful because lawmakers had weakened and ignored an independent commission established by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering. “The nature of the violation lies in the Legislature’s refusal to respect the people’s exercise of their constitutional lawmaking power and to honor the people’s right to reform their government,” Gibson said in the ruling. New maps will need to be drawn quickly, before candidates start filing in early January for the 2026 midterm elections. The ruling gives lawmakers a deadline of Sept. 24 and allows voting rights groups involved in the legal challenge to submit alternate proposals to the court.</span></p>

In July, a jury found Hazelo guilty of unauthorized access to a voting center, which is a felony. Hazelo was also found guilty of criminal trespass, a gross misdemeanor. The criminal charges stem from an incident in November 2024, where Hazelo was removed from the Island County Election Office after he refused to wear a mask while observing ballot counting. Though Island County Prosecuting Attorney Greg Banks requested Hazelo be sentenced to seven days in jail, Hazelo was ultimately sentenced to probation and required to complete 40 hours of community service with a non-profit and non-political entity. No contact orders were also issued, prohibiting Hazelo from contacting the county auditor or elections supervisor. He can only contact them if he needs to file paperwork to run for office.</span></p>

Patterson  has been living outside of the city of Milwaukee but voting in Milwaukee elections and using her 80-year-old mother&#8217;s Milwaukee address to receive increased pay, according to a criminal complaint filed Aug. 25 in Milwaukee County Circuit Court. Between March 2018 and April 2025, Patterson voted in 12 city of Milwaukee elections while living outside the city, according to the complaint. In June 2024, she submitted a voter registration application to the Milwaukee Election Commission listing her address on North 40th Street. She was actually living in Brown Deer at the time, according to prosecutors. Patterson was charged with one count of election fraud — voting by disqualified person, which is a Class I felony and punishable by not more than $10,000, or imprisoned up to 3½ years, or both. She resigned on July 21 from her job with the police department.</span></p>
