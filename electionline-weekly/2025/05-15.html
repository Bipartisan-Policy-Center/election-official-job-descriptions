														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Voter Education </strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right-Sizing Funding and Support for Local Election Officials</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By </span><a href="https://www.merivaki.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thessalia (Lia) Merivaki, PhD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> | Associate Teaching Professor, Georgetown University, McCourt School of Public Policy | Associate Research Professor, The Massive Data Institute, Georgetown University<br />
</span><a href="https://www.marasuttmannlea.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mara Suttmann-Lea, PhD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> | Associate Professor of American Politics, Connecticut College; and<br />
</span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/about-evic/#founder-director-paul-gronke"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Gronke, PhD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> | Professor of Political Science, Reed College | Founder &amp; Director, Elections &amp; Voting Information Center</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local election officials (LEOs) play a key role in </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/electionofficials/QuickStartGuides/Voter_Education_EAC_Quick_Start_Guide_508.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">educating voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But LEOs have to balance voter education with other competing needs and demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results from the </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/2024-evic-leo-survey-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024 Elections &amp; Voting Information (EVIC) Local Election Official Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ongoing research by Merivaki and Suttmann-Lea identify three important lessons for election practitioners, policymakers, and others in the democracy space:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the board, LEOs say voter education is important and professionally fulfilling.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LEOs who serve in medium-sized jurisdictions (5001 – 25,000 and 25,001 – 100,000 registered voters) are most likely to say that resource constraints limit their ability to educate voters.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think this is because medium-sized jurisdictions have too many voters to rely solely on face-to-face channels (like in the smallest jurisdictions), but have insufficient staff and resources to manage multiple communication channels (like in the largest jurisdictions).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy solution is to right-size funding and resources for election offices, paying particular close attention to the medium-sized jurisdictions that face the greatest challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While local election officials want to educate voters, many have inadequate funding to do so</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the 2024 EVIC LEO Survey, </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/codebook-none.html#Election_Preparation,_Guidance,_New_State_Laws"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 98% of LEOs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said their offices were fully prepared to administer a safe, secure, and accessible election, and 86% said they had sufficient funding to do so. There were almost </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/crosstabs-none.html#Election_Preparation,_Guidance,_New_State_Laws"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no differences by jurisdiction size.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is great news for American democracy. Adequate financial support increases a LEO’s capacity to better service their voters and ensure a positive experience at the polls. Additionally, a</span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-012-9202-4"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more positive voting experience translates into higher voter confidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/elj.2022.0055"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voter education translates into higher confidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in two ways: 1) </span><a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/elj.2022.0055"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly, by increasing transparency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about voting procedures and practices, and 2) indirectly, by improving the voter experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voter education also plays a critical role in insulating voters from election misinformation and election denial. But none of this will work if LEOs do not have sufficient resources to counter false and misleading information about election practices and procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LEOs recognize lack of citizen knowledge is a challenge for voters. As shown below, the 2024 EVIC LEO Survey found that 70% agree or strongly agree when asked whether “lack of citizen knowledge can cause significant problems. ” But those in the two medium-sized categories – LEOs serving in jurisdictions with between 5,000 to 100,000 registered voters – are most likely to say this is a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LEOs also said that they face resource constraints that limit their ability to educate voters. Only 25% of the survey respondents agree with the statement: “My office has enough time and resources to work on educating voters, along with conducting the election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, the same offices (5,000 – 100,000 registered voters) that were most likely to identify voter education as a big problem are the least likely to say they have the resources to educate voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How much time and resources are needed for voter education?</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pain point for voter education seems to be somewhere in the middle. We think that the reason for this pain point is an interaction of the different paths that LEOs need to use to educate in the differently sized jurisdictions and the resources they have to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, the medium-sized jurisdictions are too big to answer every phone call and answer every email, but are not big enough to have a dedicated communications staff or deploy paid media. We need to figure out how to right-size voter education tools for these medium-sized jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How do we come to this conclusion?</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/codebook-none.html#Voter_Education_and_Outreach"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EVIC LEO Survey asks LEOs what paths they use to educate voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing them to make multiple choices from a list. Overall, 81% of LEOs chose “interacting with voters face-to-face in my office, via phone, or through email” while 37% chose “sharing information on social media.” Finally, 30% chose “mailing print materials.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this is one of those cases where we have to look beneath the surface at differences by jurisdiction size. LEOs in the smallest jurisdictions rely almost completely on direct interaction (73% selected this option) along with social media (33% selected this option), and no other method was chosen by more than a quarter of these LEOs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LEOs in the largest jurisdictions rely on many more methods and a somewhat different mix of outlets. The EVIC LEO Survey reported that 97% selected direct interaction while 82% were interviewed by local media (TV and radio). Additionally, 70% used social media and 64% checked “mailing print materials.” Very few (8%) say they run ads on TV and radio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And how about LEOs in the two medium-size categories? They do it all – or at least try to do it all! They use one-on-one approaches, social media, interviews, and send print materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some respects, these results are good news. Our research finds that </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01442872.2022.2044020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-on-one interactions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between LEOs and voters are effective in educating voters. We also find that </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X24001534"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leveraging local media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, particularly newspapers, is also effective in getting accurate information out to voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this situation, we are concerned about the capacity of LEOs, particularly in medium-sized jurisdictions, to juggle voter education along with other demands. Regardless of capacity differences, we know that voter education </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/EAC_Voter_Education_Report_508.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drops on the priority list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during peak election periods or when budgets are constrained. Activities that aim to reach under-served populations, such as young voters, newly naturalized citizens, and language minority voters, are typically the first to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we know that LEOs in medium-sized jurisdictions have </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/crosstabs-none.html#Workload"><span style="font-weight: 400;">few fully dedicated elections staff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and are much more likely to be juggling title and recording responsibilities, like LEOs in the smallest jurisdictions, rather than being dedicated to elections full-time, like LEOs in the largest jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why we think LEOs in medium-sized jurisdictions face the biggest challenges in juggling voter education with the other demands of their offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Recommendations to Build Voter Education Capacity</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of resources for voter education remains uncertain. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have previously been able to fill election funding gaps, but some states have restricted the use of </span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/Private-Funding-Restrictions-December-2023.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">private funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in elections. States have also historically relied heavily on federal funds from the </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/about/help_america_vote_act.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to secure elections and educate voters. However, the current landscape strongly suggests that federal resources for elections may be limited for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given these changes, the weight of supporting LEOs in their voter education efforts largely falls on state and local governments. Without adequate resources, scaling back on voter education will likely have negative implications on voters’ capacity to successfully participate in elections. Cuts to voter education efforts also raise concerns about voter resilience against election misinformation, and confidence in election integrity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three ways states can ensure that LEOs build robust and sustainable voter education infrastructures.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State election offices should be more active in supporting LEOs with resources and technical support, as well as with certification training programs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State election offices should work with LEOs to establish </span><a href="https://www.myfloridaelections.com/portals/fsase/documents/FSASE_Conf_2013-Voter_ED_Survey_Analysis-Final_6-7-13.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uniform standards for nonpartisan voter education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These standards aim to ensure that voters within each state have equitable opportunities to be informed about how to participate and how elections are conducted.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State legislatures should allocate resources to be explicitly used for voter education. </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/EAC_Voter_Education_Report_508.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 13 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> receive this allocation from state legislatures, but the majority do not.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also think there is an important role for researchers to help identify the most effective and efficient methods of voter education, and to focus on these medium-sized jurisdictions to see how we can right-size our education tools for these localities.</span></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Federal Update</strong>: This week, more than 165 local election officials from 40 states </span><a href="https://modernizeourelections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FY26-Letter-from-Local-Election-Officials.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed a joint letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urging Congress to appropriate $400 million in FY 2026 to support the secure administration of American elections. The request highlights the urgent and growing need for increased, sustained federal investment to protect the integrity of the voting process.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, federal support for election infrastructure has been limited, with just $70 million provided over the past two fiscal years. The current $400 million request—authorized under Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and distributed through the Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) Appropriations bill—would restore funding to levels seen during the first Trump Administration, enabling states to modernize equipment, bolster cybersecurity, train workers, and address emerging threats. “Election officials across the country are doing everything they can to protect our democratic process, but they cannot do it alone,” said Keara Mendez, Executive Director of Project for Election Infrastructure (PEI). “While we appreciate the Trump Administration’s recognition of election security as a national priority, Congress must now step up and deliver the federal investment local officials have called for. Without this support, election offices won’t have the tools they need to ensure secure and reliable elections for all Americans. The upcoming FY 2026 appropriations package should reflect the scale of need facing election offices in every corner of the country.” The letter underscores how jurisdictions—especially in rural and underserved areas—are grappling with escalating costs tied to cybersecurity, equipment upgrades, and staffing. One elected official in Kansas noted, “Without federal support, the financial burden of updating voting equipment and securing our elections would fall heavily on our local taxpayers. As a small county, investments from the federal government aren’t just helpful, they’re essential.” The call for federal investment follows the 2024 election, which was widely viewed as well-run by voters, but nonetheless revealed how easily under-resourced jurisdictions can be stretched by preventable issues on and around Election Day. Without consistent federal investment, local election officials warn, the risks to voter trust and system integrity will only grow. The voting section of the </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/doj-voting-section-has-just-three-lawyers-left-watchdog-estimates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has only three attorneys left on staff, according to an estimate provided by Justice Connection, a group working to support the department’s remaining staff. Prior to January 20, there were an estimated 30 attorneys assigned to enforce voting rights laws. According to the group, staff attorneys in the voting section either resigned as part of the deferred resignation program, or were reassigned to another department in the DOJ. According to Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, the Department of Homeland Security won’t tell Congress how many employees at the </span><a href="https://cyberscoop.com/dhs-wont-tell-congress-how-many-people-its-cut-from-cisa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it has fired or pushed to leave. “You’ve overseen mass reductions in the workforce at CISA and” the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Thompson told DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a hearing of the panel. “Despite repeated requests from this committee on how many people have been fired or have been bullied into quitting … DHS has refused to share that information. “It should worry every American that we do not know how many people are left at FEMA to respond to disasters and how many cyber defenders still work at CISA as China and other adversaries attack our systems every day,” he continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-12874" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BexarCoTX-202x300.png" alt="" width="113" height="168" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BexarCoTX-202x300.png 202w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BexarCoTX.png 355w" sizes="(max-width: 113px) 100vw, 113px" />More Accessibility in Bexar</strong>: Bexar County, Texas will add </span><a href="https://www.govtech.com/elections/bexar-county-texas-to-add-virtual-signing-at-polls"><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtual sign-language services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for deaf voters at every polling site. County Commissioners Court unanimously agreed to spend $998,500 on 750 electronic voter check-in systems with software that will allow San Antonio-based DeafLink to offer the services of American Sign Language interpreters.  Each polling place will have at least two iPads equipped with the DeafLink software. &#8220;This is deaf history, and they have waited a long time just for this to be on your agenda,&#8221; DeafLink CEO Kay Chiodo told the county commission according to the San Antonio News Express. &#8220;They come today to show you they want to vote. They want to be part of the process, and you&#8217;re opening that door for them.&#8221; For years, the Bexar County Elections Department&#8217;s headquarters was the only polling site with deaf-accessible equipment. That increased to five locations in the presidential election last November, out of more than 300 polling sites. About 100,000 deaf people live in Bexar County. &#8220;I know it&#8217;s not necessarily the county&#8217;s job to get people to the polls, but it&#8217;s our job to make sure that access is maximized,&#8221; Precinct 2 Commissioner Justin Rodriguez said. &#8220;Rather than saying that we&#8217;re OK with 17 folks showing up, we gotta push for access for that 17,000 or 170,000 who show up who need it.&#8221; &#8220;It has been a long, long, long time struggle for our deaf community to gain equitable access to polling locations,&#8221; said Melanie Cawthon, executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group disABILITYsa. &#8220;After seven years of pushing and pushing, today we have the opportunity to say, &#8216;Let&#8217;s bring (American Sign Language) and language access to all of our polling locations for all of our residents.'&#8221;</span></p>

Moving forward, Paulina Gutiérrez, the executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, said the city is </span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/milwaukee-more-ballots-future-spring-elections-ballot-shortage-crisis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">planning to order one ballot per registered voter for future spring elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Milwaukee saw 38 percent voter turnout during the 2023 Wisconsin Supreme Court race, Gutiérrez said. She said they were planning for 45 percent voter turnout in April. Instead, voter turnout was nearly 50 percent in Milwaukee for the election. “A nearly 50 percent turnout for a spring election is record-breaking,” Gutiérrez said. Milwaukee is the only city in Wisconsin that is allowed to print its own ballots in-house. Gutiérrez said the city printed about 5,000 additional ballots before election day, a process that took “several days.” But that wasn’t enough. “It is a big problem, and that’s why we can’t let this happen again,” Gutiérrez said.  In response to the mishap, Gutiérrez said the Milwaukee Election Commission is moving forward with a one-to-one ballot order — or ordering one ballot for each registered voter in the city — for future spring elections.  “We are significantly increasing the number of ballots we order because it’s just the right thing to do,” Gutiérrez said. “Now, every voter has a ballot for them. They can come and vote in a spring election knowing that they have a ballot.”</span></p>

The study found that the 2024 election was, as a whole, safe, fair and securely conducted, with voters overwhelmingly reporting feeling safe at the polls and confident in the safety and security of the election. But rising incidents of political violence, heightened political polarization and gender-based harassment had a measurable impact on how women and gender-noncomforming people especially viewed the safety of voting in the 2024 election — and whether they turned out to vote at all, the study says. Researchers surveyed voters before and after the 2024 election in partnership with research data and analytics group YouGov and held a series of seven focus groups before the election — with three groups of White women, three groups of women of color and one made up of gender-nonconforming participants. They also fielded surveys of state lawmakers, election administrators and law enforcement officials in partnership with the nonprofit CivicPulse. The study is also one of the first of its kind to study the voting experiences of gender-nonconforming voters, who are subject to gender-based discrimination and harassment at the polls. “Tens of millions of Americans ultimately cast their ballots in 2024 without incident,” the report said. “But voting was not straightforward and safe for all Americans. Many were harassed, and a limited number were subjected to physical violence.”</span></p>

This revises an earlier estimate, based on exit polls available immediately after the election, which had put youth turnout at 42%, and it places young people’s electoral participation in 2024 much closer to 2020 (50%), which was a historically high year for voter turnout. All measures of voter participation are estimates based on the best available data at the time. CIRCLE’s analysis of publicly available voter files aggregated by Catalist includes data from 40 states which have enough age data in their voter files to allow for reliable estimates. States with less reliable data by age are not included in our estimates or analyses. While a slight drop from 2020, the 47% youth voter turnout in 2024 is a marked improvement from the 2016 presidential election, when CIRCLE estimated that just 39% of young people cast ballots.</span></p>

Data collected by BDI, supported by the Brennan Center for Justice, indicates that threats and harassment against local officeholders increased last year, mirroring trends in national-level data on hostility targeting federal judges and members of Congress. The impact is clear: many officials are withdrawing from civic engagement, avoiding work on controversial issues, and reconsidering public service altogether due to safety concerns. However, there are steps state and local policy makers can take to push back on these trends. This</span><a href="https://princeton.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1b48b61d0a18e8b8c338b0d30&amp;id=dd87b8055c&amp;e=f932d0303e"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> policy brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presents two critical recommendations that can advance efforts to mitigate the risk facing local officials: </span></p>

The Constitution gives primary authority over elections to the states, with supplementary authority to Congress. Local jurisdictions handle day-to-day operations like managing polling places and poll workers, creating a patchwork of over 10,000 election jurisdictions nationwide. The balance between federal standards and control at the state and local level has evolved over time in response to changing circumstances and emerging challenges. As threats to our democratic institutions increase, maintaining this delicate balance is essential. </span><a href="https://www.mapresearch.org/2025-democracy-101-elections-control?mc_cid=be4200648e&amp;mc_eid=284d5ebbe2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brief explains the constitutional framework for elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, explores the roles of state and federal authorities, and explains how recent broad assertions of presidential power risk destabilizing our democracy.</span></p>

The study, &#8220;Improving the Security of United States Elections with Robust Optimization,&#8221; presents a novel approach that helps detect vulnerabilities in voting machines before ballots are cast. Developed in collaboration with the Michigan Bureau of Elections, the method equips election officials with a practical strategy to detect important kinds of attacks and human error in vote counting—without placing additional strain on already limited budgets. &#8220;As federal support for election security diminishes, it&#8217;s imperative that we find practical solutions to safeguard our democratic processes,&#8221; says co-author Bradley Sturt of the University of Illinois Chicago. &#8220;Our method enhances preelection testing without imposing significant financial burdens on local jurisdictions.&#8221;</span></p>

Specifically, the nonprofit election transparency group dispatched 50 watchers to 91 sites in 24 counties during early voting, and had 160 election site watchers in 29 of New Mexico’s 33 counties on election day. “This important, nonpartisan information-gathering effort — led by and for New Mexicans — found that elections went well, votes were counted, and problems were limited,” ONME co-leader Carmen Lopez said in a statement. “We are pleased to see that the findings reflect sufficient staffing levels, poll timeliness, proper functioning of tabulators and voter privacy. All of these things in conjunction made it possible to ensure every vote was counted and New Mexicans’ voices were heard this election cycle. The findings of our report — showing both successes and room for improvement — will allow us to make the voting process and poll worker training even stronger and more transparent in the years to come.” Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver told Source New Mexico she had not seen the report yet, but had heard about its findings. “That’s what we always shoot for,” she said when Source conveyed the report’s overall positive findings. “So, that’s good.” The report did identify a handful of issues, such as same-day registration overwhelming the system. The ONME report recommends  “the state ensures robust stress-testing of the bandwidth available to accommodate processing of same-day voter registrations and works closely with county clerks to increase the levels of staffing necessary to process same-day registrations in a timely manner.”</span></p>

One proposal that would have closed Arizona schools on Election Day and forced them to allow their gymnasiums to be used as polling places. Another bill vetoed by Hobbs would have effectively created a bounty system to reward Arizonans who sued local governments that present election information “in any manner that is not imperial or neutral,” while another would have required the Arizona Department of Transportation to also send voter registration information directly to county recorders instead of solely to the Secretary of State’s Office. Other vetoed election bills include</span><a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/57leg/1R/bills/SB1036H.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 1036</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would have expanded the existing prohibition on using government resources to influence an election to include presenting information about the election “that is not impartial or neutral.” It also aimed to give every Arizona resident the chance to sue the governmental body — and directly collect the civil penalty of up to $5,000 if a court agreed an election was illegally influenced. And the two voter registration bills —</span><a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/57leg/1R/bills/HB2767H.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2767</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, directing ADOT to send voter information to counties, and</span><a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/57leg/1R/bills/HB2206S.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2206</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, barring participation in ERIC — both place “significant” costs on county recorders, the governor wrote in her veto letters.</span></p>

Kim Alexander, founder and president of the California Voter Foundation, said the problem causes widespread delays in counting. &#8220;In Orange County in the last election, officials had to duplicate over 40,000 ballots,&#8221; Alexander pointed out. &#8220;There are other reasons why ballots have to be duplicated, but the primary one is that the voter made a mistake filling out their ballot, indicated a different choice, and it has to be remade.&#8221;</span></p>

It also includes protections for LGBTQ+ voters, expands multilingual ballot access, and requires accommodations for people with disabilities at residential facilities. The state attorney general could enforce voting rights under the Colorado measure, so the state does not need to rely on federal courts to enforce voting protections. The provisions of the bill would apply to all state and municipal elections. Voters whose rights are violated under the act can take action along with civil rights groups. The measure ensures incarcerated voters have the right to vote while in custody and eases access for voters who live on tribal lands in Colorado. Eligible voters in assisted living facilities will also be provided information to make it easier for them to vote. The bill also expands requirements for multilingual ballots to include municipalities in a county already required to provide multilingual ballots under requirements of a 2021 law.</span></p>

The bill would have mandated that all voter registration applications, including any with a change in name, address, or party affiliation, could only be accepted after the Florida Department of State verified that the applicant was a U.S. citizen in one of three ways: The applicant’s voter record indicated that his or her legal status as a U.S. citizen had been verified. The applicant’s legal status as a citizen was matched against records of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles or U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Or the voter showing one of seven identification sources, such as a driver license, a U.S. passport. or a birth certificate. The bill resembled the federal Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives last month. According to Florida Phoenix, the bill’s failure drew sighs of relief from both voting-rights and voting-integrity groups, although for different reasons.</span></p>

Board Chairman John Fervier explained during a public meeting that the purpose of the committee will be to allow “all parties to have a voice in upcoming rules.” He said each of the election board’s five members will select two people to sit on the board and that he’d like to see a mix of election officials, citizens, attorneys and even one or two state lawmakers. The election board will then be able to send a proposed rule to the committee to “have them vet it and smooth it out” before it comes to the board for a vote, Fervier said. The board is tasked with creating rules consistent with state law that ensure uniformity in election practices and promote the “fair, legal, and orderly conduct” of elections.</span></p>

The measure adds a specific intent requirement for prosecuting individuals accused of falsely posing as an election official. Previous law allowed for prosecution for impersonation based on how their actions were perceived, even without proof that they intended to deceive. The crime is still classified as a level 7 nonperson felony. Gov. Laura Kelly allowed the bill to be passed into law without her signature. Kelly said in a statement that she had concerns with the section dealing with impersonation of election officials. “While this bill cleans up some of the ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the crime of impersonating an election official, it is still unclear about what actions are prohibited,” Kelly said. “It uses the term ‘engaging in conduct’ but only provides one specific example, making it still difficult to discern what is allowed and what could lead to criminal charges.” False representation of an election official now requires a person to knowingly act with intent to deceive, including by using phone, email, websites, or official seals or insignia to impersonate the secretary of state, county election officers, or their employees.</span></p>

As part of this year’s legislative session, two companion measures have been introduced to accomplish that goal: One is a proposed constitutional amendment in Senate Bill 109, and the other is a corresponding change to state statute in House Bill 590. “No funds, goods, or services donated by a foreign government, foreign entity, or noncitizen shall be used to advocate for or against any ballot proposition or question, candidate, issue, or political party, either directly or indirectly,” reads the proposed constitutional amendment, which has already passed the Senate and is awaiting consideration by the House. Louisiana law already prohibits foreign entities and noncitizens from contributing to the election of a candidate to political office. However, legal permanent residents are currently allowed to make contributions under Louisiana law, but the proposed legislation would bar them from doing so. Federal law also prohibits foreign entities and noncitizens from contributing to federal, state and local elections, with an exception for legal permanent residents, according to the Federal Election Commission.</span></p>

As stipulated by the state constitution, the initiative first had to go to the Maine Legislature for consideration, and lawmakers could either enact the bill as written or send it to a statewide vote in November 2025.  The Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee voted unanimously against the legislation last week, with one member absent, which essentially sets it on the latter path to the ballot. The committee also rejected a few other bills with similar aims that could have set up competing ballot measures. The Department of the Secretary of State announced the final wording of the referendum question on May 5, which will capture the other aspects of the initiative in addition to the voter identification requirement following requests from the public during a comment period. “The proposed measure has 28 sections, and Maine law requires that the question be presented in a clear, concise, and direct manner,” Bellows said in a statement to Maine Morning Star on Friday. “318 Mainers spoke up to share their thoughts and suggestions on the initial draft of the phrasing of the question. Given that feedback, the final question describes six changes to the voting process proposed by the underlying legislation.” It will read: “Do you want to change Maine election laws to eliminate two days of absentee voting, prohibit requests for absentee ballots by phone or family members, end ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, ban prepaid postage on absentee ballot return envelopes, limit the number of drop boxes, require voters to show certain photo ID before voting, and make other changes to our elections?” Under law, voters have the right to appeal the final decision on the wording within ten days and Alex Titcomb, campaign manager for the ballot question committee filed a legal petition in Cumberland County Superior Court on Monday, arguing the final ballot language fails to meet the standards of clarity, accuracy and impartiality.</span></p>

The election system allows voters to list candidates in order of preference with an elimination-style runoff commencing if no candidate receives 50% or more of the vote. &#8220;Who wouldn&#8217;t want candidates who aren&#8217;t ignoring and only just speaking to their base, but are forced to build a broader coalition?&#8221; said Boston City Council President Ruthzee Louijeune. &#8220;That&#8217;s what ranked-choice voting is, and it makes sure that the person who is elected has the majority support of the voters.&#8221; Opponents call the system confusing and point to Boston&#8217;s past election issues as a reason to keep the current process.

Zuri Moreno, state legislative director for the advocacy group Forward Montana, said the change especially affects Montanans who drive long distances to vote. &#8220;We&#8217;ve already heard from the courts that you&#8217;re not supposed to mess around with same-day voter registration,&#8221; Moreno pointed out. &#8220;It just takes away that opportunity for working folks and young folks and rural people across the state.&#8221;</span></p>

Assembly Bill 105 has already passed out of the Assembly Judiciary. It is now being considered by the Assembly Ways and Means. That’s because the Department of Corrections estimated, if passed, the bill would cost them approximately $66,000 a year. Jauregui told the committee that it&#8217;s based on two inmates convicted of the crime every year. AB 105 forbids someone from carrying a gun within 100 feet of an election site, with the intent of disrupting the process. The person would be facing a class D felony, if convicted. The defendant would then most likely serve time in a county jail, not state prison. “Typically, Category Ds ends up getting reduced by plea bargain to Category Es,” Assemblyman Steve Yeager, a member of the Ways and Means Committee observed. “Which I think you indicated would be mandatory probation. If in fact someone was given the benefit of a plea bargain where it ended up a Category E felony that would not be someone who would go straight to prison. They would have a chance at probation. And, then only go to prison if their probation was revoked. If you could confirm that please?” Yeager asked the Department of Corrections representative, Don Southworth.</span></p>

Under it, counties or cities could administer elections with ranked choice voting under home rule, but the state would levy financial penalties on jurisdictions for doing so by prohibiting them from getting Local Government Fund money.

Its changes would include creating in-person early voting, giving counties more time to process mail ballots, and requiring counties to use mail ballot drop boxes. But it doesn’t include one provision that will likely be important to its prospects: a voter ID requirement, something that Republicans, who control the state Senate, have always seen as crucial to any election law deal. The broad election bill, without voter ID, passed the narrowly divided chamber 102 to 101, with no votes from Republicans. One of the most significant is the introduction of in-person early voting. At least one early voting location would be required per county, with an additional location for every 100,000 voters. These locations would be open starting 11 days before the election and until the Sunday before Election Day. It would allow counties to start preprocessing mail ballots up to seven days before Election Day. Currently, counties cannot begin to process them until the morning of Election Day. The measure also would remove the heavily litigated requirement that voters hand-write the date on the mail ballot return envelope, and would prohibit counties from rejecting mail ballots for being returned without an inner secrecy envelope. If voters forget to sign the return envelope, counties would be required to notify them within 24 hours and provide them with a form, which could be filled out and returned up to six days after the election, to “cure” the error. The bill would also require a minimum of two mail-ballot drop boxes in every county. It is currently up to individual counties to decide whether they will use drop boxes, and many don’t. Counties would also be required to start using electronic poll books, which speed up voter check-in and post-voting checks, in all precincts by 2027.</span></p>

The bill would modify a 2023 law that made it harder for counties using the countywide voting program — where voters can cast a ballot anywhere in their county on Election Day — to combine small voting precincts with few voters into larger ones. The bill would effectively remove a late amendment to that law that ended up raising the minimum number of polling places that counties had to offer. Counties have struggled to comply with the new requirements. For example, in Harris County, the state’s largest, the county clerk told party leaders that for the 2024 primary, she had to offer more than 100 more polling locations than in 2020 and 2022. Because of that, Republicans and Democrats had to run their primaries jointly and share voting equipment, because there wouldn’t have been enough for all the locations.  The bill is now headed to the governor’s desk and set to become law.</span></p>

The court agreed then that Alabama&#8217;s 2021 congressional map discriminated against Black voters, in a state where African-Americans make up about a quarter of the population. But the litigation continued, and federal judges held a trial in February. In finding for the Black voters who sued, they wrote, &#8220;try as we might, we cannot understand the 2023 Plan as anything other than an intentional effort to dilute Black Alabamians&#8217; voting strength and evade the unambiguous requirements of court orders standing in the way.&#8221; The ruling pointed out Alabama&#8217;s history of defying federal court orders, and the judges said they were &#8220;deeply disturbed&#8221; by the way the state responded in this case. &#8220;The Legislature knew what federal law required and purposefully refused to provide it, in a strategic attempt to checkmate the injunction that ordered it.&#8221;</span></p>

The motion was filed  in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas on behalf of For AR Kids and Protect AR Rights. The original lawsuit was filed last month by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas who alleges eight recently approved laws governing direct democracy violate the First and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The case is assigned to Judge Timothy Brooks. Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote through the direct democracy process. The majority of the laws challenged in the lawsuit regulate the petition-gathering portion of the initiative and referendum process. New requirements include directing signature gatherers, known as canvassers, to sign a “true affidavit,” to request a photo ID from potential signers and inform them that petition fraud is a criminal offense, among other things. According to the court filings, the intervenors want to challenge additional laws, including a 2023 law that requires petitioners to gather signatures from 50 counties instead of 15 counties and Act 602 of 2025, which prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth grade reading level. Attorney General Tim Griffin cited the new law for the first time when he rejected a proposed ballot measure from the League of Women Voters last week. In this week’s filings, the plaintiffs argue that intervening in the League of Women Voters lawsuit is more efficient than filing a separate lawsuit, which they said would likely be consolidated with the League’s complaint under federal court rules.</span></p>

It comes after OC Superior Court Judge Nico Dourbetas ruled Huntington Beach could move forward with requiring an ID local elections so long as the elections did not interfere with state and federal elections. Bonta has repeatedly brought up concerns with the law since it was approved by city voters during the primary election last year, saying the voting system is already secure and the city’s efforts are undermining voter integrity.  “Secretary of State Weber and I continue to believe that the Orange County Superior Court got it wrong,” Bonta wrote in a Wednesday statement. “Our elections are already secure, and applicants who register to vote in California are already required to verify their identity during the registration process and at the polls.”   Huntington Beach leaders declined to comment for this article, but in the past have vowed they would continue appealing the case if necessary.</span></p>

Plaintiff Fair Fight Action, founded by Stacey Abrams, argued that U.S. District Court Judge Steve C. Jones erred in ruling last year that True the Vote’s challenge to 365,000 Georgia voters’ eligibility did not constitute intimidation prior to historic Democratic Senate victories in Georgia when Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff prevailed in the Jan. 5, 2021 runoff. At least one of the judges expressed skepticism about the soundness of the lower court ruling. According to Fair Fight Action and others who filed suit, True the Vote’s actions likely violated the Voting Rights Act by using inaccurate voter registration information and voter intimidation tactics such as posting citizen watchdogs to monitor people casting ballots. The federal panel peppered the attorneys with questions while acknowledging the case’s national significance on voting rights protections. Attorney Jake Evans, representing True the Vote, asserted that the intent behind the mass challenges was to protect election integrity. Evans said that the mass challenging of voters’ eligibility prior to the 2021 runoff did not amount to voter intimidation. Fair Fight’s attorney, Uzoma Nkwonta of the Elias Law Group, argued that although Jones acknowledged recklessness in his ruling, the district court erred in not following the generally accepted standard for taking a substantial step towards the course of action that led to the injury.</span></p>

Without directly addressing the merits of Iowa’s law restricting the dissemination of government records in languages other than English, the court found that the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa lacked standing to bring its lawsuit challenging the state’s application of the English Language Reaffirmation Act. The ruling is tied to a 2007 case in which LULAC was not a party. In that case, a group that included then-U.S. Rep. Steve King, four county auditors, three state legislators and U.S. English Only Inc. filed a lawsuit against Iowa’s secretary of state and the Iowa Voter Registration Commission challenging the provision of voter registration forms in languages other than English. The district court dismissed the claims of everyone but the county auditors, ruling only they had the standing to challenge the practice, and in 2008 ruled in favor of the auditors, finding that the Iowa English Language Reaffirmation Act unambiguously required all official government documents to be in English. While noting that language barriers could “serve as an impediment to voting” and that exceptions outlined in the law “might justify the use of non-English voter registration forms,” the judge noted that the secretary of state had never raised that argument. The district court enjoined the secretary of state and the Iowa Voter Registration Commission “from using languages other than English in the official voter registration forms of this state.” In 2021, LULAC sued Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, the Iowa Voter Registration Commission, and several county auditors, arguing the law, correctly interpreted, allowed for the dissemination of voting materials in languages other than English.  The district court ultimately granted LULAC’s requests to dissolve the 2008 injunction. Pate’s office appealed, and in addressing the matter, the Iowa Supreme Court said the primary question it faced was whether LULAC had standing to seek dissolution of the 13-year-old permanent injunction issued in the initial case and to seek a court interpretation of a law that did not cause any injury to LULAC itself.  The justices concluded the district court’s 2008 decision “had no effect on LULAC’s rights, status, or legal relations … LULAC asks us to direct Secretary Pate to administer the law as LULAC wishes and to allow county officials to have the discretion to administer the law as LULAC wishes. In effect, LULAC is asking the judiciary to exercise the executive functions of the government at LULAC’s behest. This the court cannot do.”</span></p>

Senate Bill 436, which took effect Jan. 1, requires voter registration applicants to include proof of U.S. citizenship with their application. The groups bringing the lawsuit call the law &#8220;a hackneyed solution in search of a phantom problem&#8221; that will &#8220;chill voter registration activity and disenfranchise Louisiana’s most vulnerable voters.&#8221; In their</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/league-of-women-voters-of-louisiana-v-landry-complaint.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, the plaintiffs claim S.B. 436 creates unfair barriers to register to vote. They argue this burden will disproportionately affect certain groups who are less likely to have access to common forms of citizenship documentation like passports and birth certificates, including Black people, low-income people, college students and the elderly, as well as people who have changed their name like married women. The groups also say the law is unnecessary, as federal law already requires individuals registering to vote to swear under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. There is no evidence to suggest noncitizens have voted in Louisiana, the groups argue. They cite Louisiana Secretary of State Nancy Landry’s own statement that just 48 noncitizens have been removed from Louisiana’s voter rolls since 2022 — a tiny fraction of the state’s nearly 3 million registered voters. The rights groups argue S.B. 436 is unconstitutionally vague, as it doesn&#8217;t define what qualifies as proof of citizenship for voter registration. They also argue the law violates the First Amendment and that it goes against the National Voter Registration Act, which is a federal law that among other things, requires states to accept a standardized mail-in voter registration form created by the federal Election Assistance Commission.</span></p>

A lawsuit filed this week in Cumberland County Superior Court accuses Bellows of writing a &#8220;deliberately confusing&#8221; ballot question because she opposes requiring voters to show photo ID at the polls. The lawsuit also accuses Bellows of &#8220;obscuring the initiative&#8217;s primary aims by stressing everything other than the voter identification requirements.&#8221; Bellows, meanwhile, said she followed the law when crafting the wording and pointed out that the proponents of the voter ID initiative didn&#8217;t submit comments on a draft version of the question. The title of the ballot question is &#8220;An Act to Require an Individual to Present Photographic Identification for the Purpose of Voting.&#8221; Yet Alex Titcomb, campaign manager of Voter ID for ME and the lead petitioner in the lawsuit, pointed out that photo ID isn&#8217;t mentioned until the very end of a long ballot question. Instead, the question focuses largely on the other proposed changes to Maine&#8217;s voting process. &#8220;It shows bias that they are trying to bring attention to minor things . . . and then decrease and hide the main change in election law here in Maine — the requirement of a photo voter ID,&#8221; Titcomb said. &#8220;Having it last, it could influence the outcome because voters, you know, may not get that far into the question before they circle a yes or no.&#8221;</span></p>

Led by Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon, challengers to the law petitioned to the state Court of Appeals. At issue is a law passed by the New York state Legislature and signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul in December 2023 that moves several local elections outside of New York City to even-numbered years starting this year, with the exception of some city or village elections, and races for county clerk, sheriff, district attorneys, local judges and others protected in the state Constitution. Republican-led challenges to the law have argued that it conflicts with individual county charters. Twenty New York counties are chartered, meaning they have locally drafted and approved laws outlining the structure and authority of county government, and there have been three separate amendments in the state Constitution allowing for and protecting counties&#8217; abilities to govern through charters. An appeals court dismissed that argument, ruling that the state Constitution gives local governments the right to a “a legislative body elective by the people” and to adopt alternative forms of county government, &#8220;but neither of those provisions gives a county exclusive local control over the manner in which local elections will be held or the specific details of each office.&#8221;</span></p>

The voting rights organizations North Carolina A. Philip Randolph Institute and Action NC argued Friday at oral arguments in Richmond, Virginia, that the state’s felony voter law was enacted in 1877 to disenfranchise freed Black citizens after the Civil War. The discrimination continues as Black residents remain disproportionately impacted by the law, the groups say. The statute makes it a crime for a convicted felon to cast a ballot before his or her voting rights have been restored. Critically, criminal intent is irrelevant — a person can be convicted even if he or she voted under the mistaken belief they were eligible to do so. The law was struck down last year by U.S. District Judge Loretta C. Biggs, a Barack Obama appointee, who</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/biggs-opinion-nc-voting-felony-law.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote in an opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the law was “enacted with discriminatory intent” and “continues to disproportionately impact Black voters.” North Carolina’s district attorneys and the State Board of Elections appealed the decision. The General Assembly amended the law in the fall to add intent as an element of the crime, which state officials argue makes the issue moot in future elections. But the old law was not repealed, raising questions of whether it remained in effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5490" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ND-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />North Dakota</strong>: The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Nation </span><a href="https://northdakotamonitor.com/2025/05/14/appeals-court-rules-against-north-dakota-tribes-in-voting-rights-case/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t have standing to bring a voting discrimination claim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the state of North Dakota. In a 2-1 decision overturned a 2023 decision by a North Dakota federal judge that found the state’s 2021 redistricting plan unlawfully diluted the tribes’ voting power. The ruling will have implications for North Dakota’s legislative districts. Attorneys representing the tribes say the appellate court’s ruling eliminates voters’ ability to challenge racial discrimination under the Voting Rights Act in North Dakota and the six other 8th Circuit states. The appellate court already limited voters’ ability to challenge potential violations of the Voting Rights Act in 2023, when it decided private citizens cannot bring lawsuits under Section 2 of the law, which protects voters against racial discrimination. Only the U.S. attorney general can file such claims, the court ruled. For a time, the question remained open as to whether voters have the right to bring those same allegations under a separate federal civil rights law: Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code. This week, a panel of 8th Circuit judges decided the answer is no. The language of the Voting Rights Act does not authorize citizens to file race discrimination claims through Section 1983, Judge Raymond Gruender wrote in the majority opinion. Chief Judge Steven Colloton dissented. He noted that Section 1983 says people may sue for “the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.” “The reference to ‘and laws’ encompasses any law of the United States,” Colloton wrote. His dissent also criticizes the court’s 2023 decision, writing that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act “expressly forbids ‘a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.’” Since 1982, private plaintiffs have brought more than 400 actions based under Section 2, he wrote.</span></p>

Stairs filed a police report with Dallas Police days after the alleged incident on May 3 at Friendship West Church polling location, according to a statement by the Dallas County Republican Party chairman. Dallas Police spokesperson Corbin Rubinson said the victim reported that the suspect knocked her phone out of her hands and demanded she leave the location. DPD transferred the report to the Dallas County Sheriff&#8217;s Office after it was filed May 5 because the sheriff&#8217;s office has jurisdiction over polling places. Sheriff spokesperson Doug Sisk said investigators will review the report and decide whether an offense occurred. &#8220;From what I understand, it&#8217;s an accusation of a physical contact thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So all it&#8217;s going to be is, basically, probably boil down to a Class C traffic ticket — Class C assault.&#8221; Assault by contact — a misdemeanor different than a felony assault — means a victim was not necessarily injured.</span></p>

Chapman admitted in Wayne County Circuit Court that there was enough evidence to find him guilty of voting twice. “He cast two ballots in the 2020 general election. So one was in person here in Wayne County, and the other, he cast an absentee by mail ballot in Florida,” said Secretary of State Kris Warner.  At the time, that offense was a misdemeanor.  But in 2022 the West Virginia Legislature made it a felony to vote illegally, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Chapman was ordered to pay a $250 fine.</span></p>

In its federal suit the group claims that</span><a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/HB0156"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 156</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which becomes effective July 1, will impose burdensome and unnecessary hurdles, especially for women, Hispanic, youth and low-income people. “Wyoming has a proud tradition of fair and secure elections, and there is no evidence of non-citizen voting or widespread fraud to justify the harsh new restrictions in HB 156,” said the center&#8217;s Executive Director Jenny DeSarro. “This unnecessary law creates significant barriers that will prevent eligible citizens from exercising their constitutional right to vote, particularly young voters, women who changed their names when they married, low-income voters, and Hispanic voters. These hardworking Wyomingites must be allowed to exercise their rights and freedoms at the ballot box.” The nonprofit is seeking declaratory judgment that the new law’s ID requirements are unconstitutional, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief from its enforcement. The law will require people registering to vote in Wyoming to produce one of the following: a valid state driver’s license or identification card; a valid tribal ID card from a federally recognized tribe; a valid state ID that’s Real ID compliant; a valid U.S. passport, certificate of citizenship or naturalization; a military draft record or selective service registration card; a consular report of birth abroad; or an original or certified copy of a birth certificate. The center says that the law allows county clerks to reject driver’s licenses, state or tribal ID if there’s an indication the holder isn’t a citizen. However, the law offers no instruction on how to make that determination, and no proof of non-citizenship is needed to reject a potential voter.</span></p>
