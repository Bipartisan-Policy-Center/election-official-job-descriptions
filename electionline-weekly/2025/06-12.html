							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bolstering  Elections</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dole and Kennedy Institutes publish landmark report on funding of election administration</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News headlines often scream about how much is spent on elections in America, but those news stories focus on the </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/live-update/election-news-2024/the-cost-of-this-election"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign side of the coin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Very little news is ever generated on how much it actually costs state and local officials to administer an election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12941" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DoleKennedyCover-228x300.png" alt="" width="228" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DoleKennedyCover-228x300.png 228w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DoleKennedyCover-779x1024.png 779w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DoleKennedyCover-768x1009.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DoleKennedyCover.png 1108w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" />Time and time again, the diverse system of conducting elections in the United States – created by the various states and their local jurisdictions – has reflected the will of their voters and promoted the peaceful transfer of power at the federal, state, and local level. Yet, this system is complex and under historic stress. Election administrators</span><a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2022-05/TheCostofConductingElections-2022.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continually lack sufficient budgets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adequate staffing, and modernized equipment. Moreover, they face ever-increasing public scrutiny and waning trust in voting results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government, however, remains absent due to the reduced role they have in administering elections. The Constitution leaves the responsibility of determining the “time, place, and manner” of elections to the states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t until 2002 that Congress began taking steps to create a national standard for administering an election with the </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/HAVA41.PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help America Vote Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (HAVA). Furthermore, with election security becoming more prevalent, the Department of Homeland Security designated elections administration a critical infrastructure. But while both offer new guidelines for administration and security, they offer little in terms of </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/funding-election-administration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainable funding models</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for states and local jurisdictions to draw from in order to meet their present-day needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics and the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate have published a landmark, comprehensive anthology report – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bolstering Funding and Practices for Resilient Elections: Sustainable Funding and Models of Success at the State and Local Level,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – designed to equip election administrators with the data and research necessary to inform policymakers about the need for increased investment in our elections infrastructure to bolster our elections systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report was created through the organization’s </span><a href="https://emkinstitute.org/bolstering-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolstering Elections Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with production of the report made possible by a grant from the Election Trust Initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At its core, this report is inspired by the bipartisan engagement and leadership of our namesakes; and like the meaningful change Senators Dole and Kennedy brought about during the 20th century, our hope is that this report will be used by policymakers to bring about much needed, bipartisan change in the ways we fund and support election administration in the United States,” said Audrey Coleman, director of the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics and Adams Hinds, CEO of the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February 2024, the institutes invited administrators and policy experts to a symposium that aimed to examine why understanding how the more than 8,000 election jurisdictions across the country are funded is such a complex issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the researchers, practitioners, and experts who contributed to this report show, it doesn’t have to be; highlighting models of success creates a starting point for policymakers to make significant investments in elections administration, including through the creation of more stable funding streams at all levels. This gives election administrators access to a larger budget, which can be used to adequately staff their offices and procure modernized resources, thereby bolstering the efficiency in administering an election and improving public trust in elections systems and results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional takeaways from the report include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local governments fund approximately 85% of the costs associated with administering an election, despite surveys showing the public believes federal and state government bear a majority of the cost burden</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research shows that even with local governments paying a majority of the costs, election support is roughly 0.5% of a local government’s total budget</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election administrators and offices are under-resourced, particularly in rural areas, with many facing staffing shortages and outdated infrastructure</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal funding and guidelines for administering elections are episodic, often reactive to the most recent election issue (e.g., 2000 Election recount in Florida, 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic), creating unsustainable funding mechanisms and inconsistent national standards for local governments to rely on</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">States interpret and fulfill their election responsibilities in a variety of ways, with some creating innovations that show promise (e.g., Colorado’s cost-based reimbursement model, Pennsylvania’s Act 88) but are not widespread</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institutes </span><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/9017490516002/WN_jNXrJ4nPTF-es7XOzbo9kA#/registration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will hold a virtual event to formally launch the report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Wednesday, June 18 at 12 p.m. EST/11 a.m. CST with some of the nation’s top experts in elections administration; including University of Kansas professor Zach Mohr; Auburn University Professor of Political Science Mitchell Brown; Commissioner Donald Palmer of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission; Bipartisan Policy Center Election Project director Rachel Orey; Colorado Deputy Director of Elections Hilary Rudy; and John Fortier, Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>About the Dole Institute</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by the leadership legacies of Senators Bob and Elizabeth Dole, and the enduring civic contributions of the Greatest Generation, the </span><a href="https://doleinstitute.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dole Institute of Politics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strives to promote a new era of leadership that uses politics to bring people together through opportunities that emphasize bipartisan cooperation, public service, and civic education and engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>About the Edward M. Kennedy Institute</strong><br />

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7086" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/USDOJ-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Federal Update I</strong>: Miles Parks and Jude Joffe-Block with NPR have a story today about the U.S. Department of Justice </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5426097/trump-justice-department-voter-data-colorado"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demanding an unprecedented amount of election data from Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to documents obtained by NPR, on May 12, the Justice Department asked Colorado&#8217;s secretary of state to turn over &#8220;all records&#8221; relating to 2024 federal elections, as well as preserve any records that remain from the 2020 election — a sprawling request several voting experts and officials told NPR was highly unusual and concerning, given President Trump&#8217;s false claims about elections. &#8220;What they&#8217;re going to do with all this data, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat. &#8220;But I&#8217;m sure they will use it to push their ridiculous disinformation and lies to the American public.&#8221; The request could be interpreted to include voter registration materials, ballots and voting equipment, much of which is retained by counties, not the secretary of state. &#8220;It would be an enormous amount of information, and it&#8217;s very unlikely the DOJ would even know what to do with all of that,&#8221; said David Becker, former DOJ attorney and  who now runs the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research (CEIR). &#8220;This appears more like a fishing expedition than it does some kind of targeted investigation.&#8221; The demand indicated that the Justice Department received a complaint about Colorado&#8217;s election records retention, but it&#8217;s not clear who filed the complaint or what the issue was. The department declined to comment or provide the complaint when asked about it by NPR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Federal Update II</strong>: According to media reports, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-appears-open-blocking-trumps-election-overhaul-order-2025-06-06/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appeared open last week to blocking enforcement of President Donald Trump&#8217;s sweeping executive order </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">overhauling elections that calls for requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens and barring states from counting mail-in ballots received after Election Day. At a hearing, Justice Department lawyer Bridget O&#8217;Hickey argued the Republican president&#8217;s order was lawful and that any request by 19 Democratic-led states challenging it was premature. But Casper said those states were under pressure to comply with Trump&#8217;s order before voting begins in the 2026 federal election cycle and that 13 of them that accept mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day say they could be sued by the U.S. Department of Justice unless she issues an injunction. &#8220;Why isn&#8217;t that warranted now?&#8221; Casper asked. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security approved a fiscal 2026 funding bill this week that would cut the </span><a href="https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-budget-135m-dhs-2026-house-appropriations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by $135 million from fiscal 2025, significantly less than the Trump administration’s proposed $495 million. The chairman of the committee Rep. Mark Amodei, said the annual Department of Homeland Security funding measure “responsibly trimmed” the CISA budget. But Illinois Rep. Lauren Underwood, the top Democrat on his panel, said the legislation “fails to address the catastrophic cybersecurity threats facing our critical infrastructure.” The subcommittee approved the bill by a vote of 8-4. “In terms of cyber security, DHS has an important role to play defending critical infrastructure and Federal networks against cyber attack, but CISA strayed from the authority given to it by the Congress,” Amoedi said in a prepared opening statement. “We have responsibly trimmed that agency’s budget by eliminated duplicative contracts and positions, consolidated election security and chemical security missions into the existing critical infrastructure security framework, defunded equity positions and returned the focus of CISA to its core mission of protecting Federal networks, and ensuring that the days of censorship through mis-, dis- and mal- information efforts are over.”</span></p>

They were born on U.S. soil, are entitled to U.S. passports and allowed to serve in the U.S. military, but 11 people in a small Alaska town are facing criminal charges after they tried to participate in a fundamental part of American democracy: voting. The defendants, who range in age from their 20s to their 60s, were all born in American Samoa — the only U.S. territory where residents are not automatically granted citizenship at birth. Prosecutors say they falsely claimed American citizenship when registering or trying to vote. The situation is not limited to Alaska. In Oregon, officials inadvertently registered nearly 200 American Samoan residents to vote when they got their driver’s licenses under the state’s motor-voter law. Of those, 10 cast ballots in an election, according to the Oregon Secretary of State’s office, but officials found they did not intend to break the law and no crime was committed. In Hawaii, one resident who was born in American Samoa, Sai Timoteo, ran for the state Legislature in 2018 before learning she wasn’t allowed to hold public office or vote. She also avoided charges.</span></p>

The Santa Fe County, New Mexico Clerk’s Office has launched a public contest to name its ballot sorting machine. Residents are asked to submit either a creative, clever, or meaningful idea for naming the machine. The machine plays a key role in the county’s vote-by-mail process. It’s capable of scanning and sorting thousands of ballots per hour. “We’re seeing more and more voters take advantage of vote-by-mail,” said Katherine Clark, county clerk. “This machine, combined with our experienced elections team, helps us meet that demand while maintaining speed, accuracy, and public trust.” Submissions are open through June. Finalists will be selected by the Clerk’s Office, then presented for public voting later in the summer. We will for sure keep you posted! </span></p>

Specifically, they wanted to understand the relationship poll workers have with each other and with voters. CCDs small but mighty team of civic designers across the United States served as poll workers for the 2024 General Election as part of this ethnographic participant observation research study. Their observations highlighted how poll workers humanize and personalize the election process, creating a culture that shapes the voting experience. Elections are often the single touchpoint that connects voters to our electoral democracy, with poll workers being the “face of elections.”</span></p>

This structure results in significant variation in how different jurisdictions run elections, creating opportunities for states to learn from each other’s successes, challenges, and best practices. To explore these differences and promote cross-state learning, </span><a href="https://www.rstreet.org/research/lessons-from-the-states-building-trust-in-arizona-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">R Street has developed a policy study series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on the unique blend of election policies in place in three swing states that have played pivotal roles in recent federal elections: Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. In recent years, Arizona has emerged as a competitive state in high-profile national campaigns, drawing increased attention to the mechanics of how the state conducts its elections. Three aspects of Arizona’s system offer meaningful contrasts with other state approaches. First, Arizona is one of only two states with a citizenship verification requirement to vote; this is particularly relevant at this time because of the growing interest among Republican lawmakers to adopt this type of policy nationwide. Second, the state has a long history of allowing mail-in voting to promote engagement and accessibility, but, despite their democratic benefits, such policies have created challenges in counting ballots in a timely manner. Third, the state boasts one of the largest populations of unaffiliated voters in the country, making primary reform particularly worthy of consideration.</span></p>

The authors – Samuel Baltzk, Fernanda Gonzalez, Kevin Guo, Jacob Jaffe and Charles Stewart III – compiled every available audit of votes cast in the 2020 United States elections at the county level or higher, and we used this election audit database to produce nation-scale numerical estimates of how accurately votes were counted. The authors  find that the net error rate in counting presidential votes was on the order of thousandths of a percent, with similarly inconsequential errors for other state and federal contests. This nation-scale estimate of the accuracy of vote counting in a large federalist democracy suggests an approach for researchers to positively establish the legitimacy of fair electoral contests. After many elections, the accuracy of the vote count is assessed by retabulating a small percentage of ballots. These audits form one of the richest bodies of evidence regarding electoral legitimacy, which is particularly important in democracies where the accuracy of elections has been prominently questioned. In decentralized democracies such as the United States, however, there is tremendous variation in the conduct and reporting of audits, which are never compiled into one place to facilitate precise analysis of their results. Here, the authors introduce a nation-scale audit result dataset, which we use to estimate the error rate in vote counting during the 2020 U.S. election.</span></p>

Thomas Jackson, D-Thomasville, would have required one early voting precinct in each county for one week before Election Day. The bill was assigned to the House Constitution, Campaigns and Elections Committee, but Rep. Bob Fincher, R-Woodland, chair of the committee, said he did not take HB 59 up in his committee because he is not in favor of early voting due to the cost to the state. </span><a href="https://alison.legislature.state.al.us/files/pdf/SearchableInstruments/2025RS/HB97-int.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 97</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Rep. Kenyatté Hassell, D-Montgomery, would have allowed voters to cure their absentee ballot affidavit if they submit them before the election and the absentee election manager finds an error. Currently, the ballots are set aside and not counted if election officials find a defect with the affidavits. The bill was assigned to Fincher’s committee, but Fincher said he did not take it up because of conversations with other legislators and the Secretary of State Wes Allen. </span><a href="https://alison.legislature.state.al.us/files/pdf/SearchableInstruments/2025RS/HB31-int.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 31</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Rep.

James Comer (R-Kentucky), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said on the House floor. “Diluting that right by extending it to noncitizens — whether here legally or illegally — undermines the voice of D.C. residents.” The vote to repeal the city’s noncitizen voting law marked the third time the House has sought to block the law in as many years, showing the GOP’s relentless mission to stop the policy ever since it passed the D.C. Council in 2022. The repeal effort has repeatedly garnered broad bipartisan support, with 56 Democrats joining Republicans in the 266-148-1 vote this time, a slight uptick from previous years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6527" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MaineCap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Maine</strong>: Lawmakers advanced a bill this week to allow </span><a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2025/06/11/maine-lawmakers-push-to-expand-ranked-choice-voting-to-governors-race/?uuid=56c7f67c-7b39-4497-8d1b-b3cfe90546bd&amp;lid=85487"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be used in statewide elections, including for governor. If enacted, the bill may set up a confrontation in court. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court issued a 2017 advisory opinion that using ranked choice voting for state-level offices conflicted with the state Constitution, which says such offices are determined by who gets the most votes. Currently, ranked choice voting is used in Maine for federal offices and in gubernatorial and state-level primary elections. Some cities, such as Portland and Westbrook, also use ranked choice voting for local elections. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Cameron Reny, D-Round Pond, cleared both chambers this week in mostly party-line votes, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. It narrowly passed in an initial 72-70 vote in the House of Representatives on Wednesday with seven people absent and it cleared the Senate 20-14 without debate on June 10. The bill faces additional votes in each chamber before it can be sent to Gov. Janet Mills, whose aides did not respond to questions about the proposal. Opponents argued that the bill would conflict with the Maine Law Courts’ advisory opinion and would expand a system that is confusing to some voters. But proponents said a case decided by the Alaska Supreme Court dismantled Maine’s advisory opinion and upheld the constitutionality of the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill aimed at requiring voters to show a </span><a href="https://wgme.com/news/local/maine-voter-id-bill-fails-in-committee-votes-voting-election-republicans-citizens-petition-ballot-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">photo ID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before voting has failed. It didn&#8217;t make it out of committee at the State House. LD 38 would have required the secretary of state to provide free IDs to people who need them. The Republican initiative aimed to reassure Mainers that state elections are secure, though some Republicans admit there is no widespread voter fraud in the state. Even though the bill is dead in Augusta, Maine voters will still get to have their say on this issue in November after a citizen’s petition put a voter ID question on the ballot.</span></p>

The bill would have also required the county clerk, city clerk, or registrar of voters to post a sign at each election site notifying people that having a firearm at the site was prohibited and listing the possible penalties. The bill passed 27 to 14 with one excused in the State Assembly, and passed 13 to 8 in the State Senate. In his veto message, Governor Lombardo said that the bill was commendable in its intent to enhance public confidence in the safety of our election process. However, he went on to say that the bill simply duplicated protections already established under federal and state law against voter intimidation.</span></p>

The House also failed to change the state’s primary election day from September to June, and decided cities and towns have to purge their voter checklists yearly instead of once in a decade. The House voted to require that people registering for an absentee ballot will now have to present proof they are a United States citizen to receive the ballot. Supporters of Senate Bill 218, said the bill simply brings the requirements to register for an absentee ballot in line with registering to vote in person by adding a person needs to prove citizenship through a birth certificate, passport or naturalization papers. Women who changed their names when they married would need to provide proof of the change from their maiden name. The bill passed on a 192-149 vote and goes to the Senate because of changes the House made. The House also approved Senate Bill 287 which will require a photo ID to obtain an absentee ballot. The House also approved a bill that would require town and city clerks to purge their checklist annually. Currently the lists are purged every 10 years. The House voted down Senate Bill 222 which would have changed the state’s primary from the second Tuesday in September to the second Tuesday in June.</span></p>

Since first implementing universal vote by mail during the pandemic, other election policy proposals in the past few sessions failed to make it to the finish line. But lawmakers this week were able to strike a deal advancing a bipartisan bill. The measure is a big priority for state elections officials who say the changes are needed to make the 2026 election run smoother. Changes include auditing voter checklists and district boundaries; requiring write-in candidates to register in primary elections, and ways to streamline the counting of those ballots. The measure also restricts candidates who lose a party primary to run for the general election under a different party or as an Independent &#8212; what is known as “taking a second bite of the apple.” A provision to have ranked-choice voting for the next presidential primary was not included in the bill.</span></p>

According to Votebeat, experts say</span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB2753"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 2753,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which lawmakers approved this week, will likely boost turnout, as it includes more time for voting on weekends. The author of the bill, Sen. Bob Hall, a Republican from North Texas, told Votebeat that the change also “simplifies the process” and would reduce the cost of election operations and equipment. But local election officials said they aren’t so sure of that, and are still determining how it will work and what it could cost counties. The bill doesn’t allocate any funding for counties to implement the changes. And there’s one notable side effect of taking away the gap after the early-voting period: Partial vote tallies from the early ballots, which are typically released shortly after polls close on Election Day, won’t be available until later, election administrators said. The bill is headed to Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk for his signature, though it can become law without it.</span></p>

Under the initiative, county auditors would determine whether each person on the voter list has demonstrated proof of citizenship. Those who have not will be notified to produce this documentation or be dropped from the registration list and would not receive a ballot. The verification requirements could be met if people produce documentation such as a U.S. passport, a birth certificate, or a certificate of naturalization. “It focuses on the voter ID, the proof of citizenship to register to vote. That&#8217;s the only thing it does. It does not touch vote-by-mail mechanisms,” Walsh said. “In the big picture, would we like to see some of those other reforms here in Washington? Yes, but we believe that the voter ID part is the first step and we may address those others later.&#8221;</span></p>

Both Democrat and Republican lawmakers proposed separate legislation aimed at making statewide referendum questions easier for voters to understand. While state law already mandates that referendum questions must be written concisely and in the affirmative, it does not require questions to be written in plain language — a way that makes them easily understandable for the general public. Both bills aim to make referendum questions and constitutional amendments easier to understand for Wisconsin voters, though they differ on how that would be accomplished. The Democrat-authored bill would require referendum questions to be written in plain language to avoid tricky phrasing that could confuse voters. In addition to using plain language for questions on the ballot, the bill would require referendum questions related to constitutional amendments to clarify for voters whether the proposed changes already exist in state statute. On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Jerry O&#8217;Connor, R-Fond Du Lac, said that rather than just putting the questions in plain language, the bill he co-authored goes a step farther by creating an informational notice with the full text of the referendum question or proposed amendment, an explanation in plain language what a &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; vote means and a summary of current law in plain text, if applicable.</span></p>

The</span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/06.06.25-Ministerial-Alliance-v-Thurston.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas by a group of voters and the Christian Ministerial Alliance. It claimed boundaries for Arkansas’ 2nd Congressional District were racially gerrymandered and diluted the votes of Black Arkansans.  Congressional and state legislative districts are redrawn after the U.S. Census each decade in a process known as redistricting. The goal is to create districts that contain roughly the same population.  The Ministerial Alliance’s lawsuit was one of four filed to challenge Arkansas’ 2021 redistricting process and the only one that hadn’t been dismissed. U.S. Circuit Judge David Stras, U.S. District Judge D.P. Marshall Jr. and U.S. District Judge James Moody Jr. granted the state’s motion for summary judgment, saying there was not enough evidence to support the plaintiffs’ racial discrimination claims. “Multiple Arkansas citizens challenge how the General Assembly redrew the state’s congressional district lines,” Friday’s order states. “Although their allegations were plausible enough to survive a motion to dismiss [Docs. 35, 42], the evidence does not back up their claims of racial discrimination. For that reason, we grant summary judgment to Secretary of State John Thurston.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3587" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/California-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />California:</strong> The Fresno County Board of Supervisors said this week they will </span><a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article308339930.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appeal a court ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that elections for top law enforcement leaders must be held during presidential elections, when voter turnout is highest. The county lost the lawsuit last week brought by state Attorney General Rob Bonta and Secretary of State Shirley Weber, which argued setting the election on gubernatorial cycles was against state law. The supervisors discussed the case in closed session, and released a statement afterward. “The county respectfully disagrees with the superior court and intends to challenge the ruling in the court of appeal,” the statement read in full. The supervisors came to a consensus and no vote was taken, according to county spokesperson Sonja Dosti. A Fresno County Superior Court judge ruled June 2 to invalidate Fresno County’s Measure A. The 2024 ballot initiative that passed and aligned Fresno County District Attorney and Sheriff elections with the off cycle, which has a lower voter turnout than those on the presidential cycle. The measure passed with a 55% vote but was at odds with an earlier law, Assembly Bill 759, that aligned the elections. Gubernatorial races across the state routinely draw lower numbers of voters than presidential. The most recent presidential election in Fresno in 2024 saw an almost 60% turnout, while the off-cycle election two years earlier drew 27% of voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3355" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Georgia:</strong> This week, the state Supreme Court </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-supreme-court-state-election-board-rules-88de13189060dfd42069ed558ccbcad9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overturned four rules passed by the State Election Board </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">just before last year’s general election, ruling the board overstepped its authority and intruded on lawmaking power reserved for legislators under the state constitution. The state Supreme Court’s unanimous decision limits the future rulemaking ability of the State Election Board and other executive branch agencies of Georgia’s government. The board passed a slate of new rules in August and September that mostly had to do with processes after ballots are cast, spawning a flurry of lawsuits. The new rules brought an outcry that the board’s majority was trying to improperly use its power to help Donald Trump. The board members claimed the changes were needed to improve the accuracy of results. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas Cox ruled in October that seven of the rules were “illegal, unconstitutional and void,” but the board appealed. In its decision, the state Supreme Court invalidated the requirements that ballots be hand-counted after the close of polls, that someone delivering an absentee ballot in person provide a signature and photo ID, that county election board members be allowed to conduct a “reasonable inquiry” before certifying results and that county election board members be granted broad access to election-related documents. The court let stand a rule requiring video surveillance and recording of ballot drop boxes after polls close during early voting. It told a lower court to decide whether Chatham County Board of Elections member James Hall has the right to challenge two other rules, which expand designated areas where partisan poll watchers can stand at tabulation centers and require daily public updates of the number of votes cast during early voting. As part of its decision, the court overturned a 1990 decision that widened the rulemaking power of state agencies. Chief Justice Nels Peterson wrote that the decision was a mistake because it doesn’t “provide clear, objective guidelines that cabin an executive branch agency’s exercise of discretion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2025/06/georgian-falsely-accused-in-2000-mules-of-voting-fraud-wants-filmmaker-to-pay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">falsely accused of voting fraud </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the conspiracy film “2000 Mules” tried to hold its producers responsible, asking a federal judge to rule in his favor. But the moviemakers, including conservative filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza and the election group True the Vote, said they couldn’t have defamed a man whose face was blurred and who wasn’t identified by name. U.S. District Judge Steven Grimberg didn’t signal how he would rule, asking skeptical questions of both sides before deciding whether to send the case to a jury or dismiss it. “This case is not that complicated. It’s about defendants working together to spread a lie,” said Lea Haber Kuck, an attorney for Mark Andrews, an auditor from Gwinnett County who brought the suit. “They accuse him of committing a crime &#8230; and expose him to ridicule, hatred and contempt.” The</span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/2000-mules-sued-over-debunked-allegations-against-a-georgia-voter/TKZZSNRHJZAI3MTUBLUSMBLIPQ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> centers on an eight-second surveillance video featured in “2000 Mules” that shows Andrews returning absentee ballots for himself and four family members at a drop box before the 2020 election. D’Souza, speaking as the narrator, tells the audience “What you are seeing is a crime. These are fraudulent votes.” State election investigators cleared Andrews, and D’Souza later apologized, saying the film was based on “inaccurate information.” Dropping off ballots for family members is legal in Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5257" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MI-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Michigan:</strong> The House of Representatives announced June 5 that it has filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson for her </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/briefs/house-republicans-file-lawsuit-against-michigans-secretary-of-state-over-subpoena-fight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleged failure to comply with a subpoena</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued by the chair of the chamber’s oversight body. The complaint, House of Representatives v. Benson, filed in the Michigan Court of Claims on Wednesday, follows the House Oversight Committee’s request for election training materials from Benson and her office, which resulted in a subpoena. House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township) last month asked the full chamber to hold Benson in civil contempt for her alleged failure to provide the materials, which the House moved as a resolution later that day. Now, the chamber’s Republicans have sued Benson seeking a declaratory judgment holding that the House issued a valid subpoena to which the secretary of state must comply. That lawsuit also seeks an injunction prohibiting Benson or the Michigan Department of State from modifying relevant records in the initial request. Department spokesperson Cheri Hardmon said in a statement that Benson asked lawmakers to let a court review their request for sensitive information that, in the wrong hands, would compromise the security of the state’s elections.</span></p>

At the time, the county put out a statement that she was stressed and had requested time off for self-care. She said this was not true. Her lawsuit alleges county Manager Eric Brown and others coerced her to take personal leave and threatened her with insubordination and investigation if she talked about what was going on with the media, commissioners or staff. Her lawsuit also alleges: Assistant County Manager Kate Thomas engaged in &#8220;a pattern of bullying and harassment&#8221; against her.; Her privacy was violated by revealing personal health information regarding anxiety and high blood pressure; And that the county’s public comments about her have hurt future job prospects. The county terminated her employment on Feb. 12. “The county is in the process of reviewing the amended complaint, which was only recently filed and served,” said Kendall Holcomb, Washoe County District Attorney&#8217;s Office spokesperson. “We plan to file a response and vigorously defend the action. Due to pending litigation, we have no further comment at this time.&#8221; Washoe County has until July 31 to reply to Burgess’ complaint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7894" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ORFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Oregon:</strong> On June 6, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it would </span><a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/06/06/trump-challenges-oregon-voter-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">file a “statement of interest” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in an ongoing suit between a number of conservative plaintiffs and the Oregon Secretary of State’s Office.  The U.S. DOJ says it is watching the case closely for signs Oregon violated a federal law, the National Voter Registration Act. “Accurate voter registration rolls are critical to ensure that elections in Oregon are conducted fairly, accurately, and without fraud,” U.S. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon said in a statement. “States have specific obligations under the list maintenance provisions of the NVRA, and the Department of Justice will vigorously enforce those requirements.” Oregon Secretary of State Tobias Read declined to comment on the filing, citing ongoing litigation. “What I can say is that we take our responsibility to maintain secure, accurate voter rolls seriously,” Read said in a statement. “Oregonians want and deserve fair and free elections, and we must do everything in our power to deliver.” The Oregon Department of Justice said it was researching the matter. At issue is a lawsuit filed in October by the national conservative group Judicial Watch, along with the Constitution Party of Oregon and two individual Oregonians, Suni Danforth and Hannah Shipman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5429" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Pennsylvania:</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court has </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-pennsylvania-provisional-ballots-a46b26e743c212ef7fa979dd32e47594"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected a Republican appeal </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and left in place a Pennsylvania court decision allowing people to cast provisional ballots when their mail-in votes are rejected for not following technical procedures in state law. The court released the decision June 6, after an “apparent software malfunction” sent out early notifications about orders that had been slated to be released Monday. A technological error also resulted in an opinion being posted early last year. The justices acted in an appeal filed by the Republican National Committee, the state GOP and the Republican-majority election board in Butler County. Pennsylvania’s top court ruled last year that the county must count provisional ballots that were cast by two voters after they learned their mail-in ballots were voided because they arrived without mandatory secrecy envelopes. Pennsylvania Democrats had urged the court to stay out of the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5231" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Utah-FLag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Utah:</strong> Former gubernatorial candidate Phil Lyman filed a federal lawsuit against Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson on June 6, </span><a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51326206/phil-lyman-sues-lt-gov-henderson-seeking-access-to-voter-registration-list"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking access to voter registration data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and arguing that Utah&#8217;s law allowing voters to make their information private runs afoul of federal law. Lyman, a former state lawmaker, has long claimed Utah&#8217;s elections are fraudulent and sought to obtain the complete voter rolls after losing the GOP primary to Gov. Spencer Cox last summer. Lyman regularly accused Henderson, the state&#8217;s top election official, of fraud and tried to have her and Cox thrown out of office. His latest lawsuit, however, doesn&#8217;t allege any malfeasance on Henderson&#8217;s part but says Utah&#8217;s law on private voter records conflicts with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires that voter registration records be public. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court with the help of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a conservative firm based in Virginia that has filed similar suits in other states and made claims of voter fraud. A spokesman for Henderson said the Utah Lieutenant Governor&#8217;s Office does not comment on active or pending litigation.</span></p>

In the seventh symposium of AEI’s “We Hold These Truths: America at 250” initiative, scholars of American history, law, and politics discuss how the American Revolution unleashed the forces of constitution-making in the United States. As states erected new governments in the wake of independence, they worked to combine traditions of colonial self-government with both classical and novel political theories. Studying the revolutionary period shows how it gave birth to a constitutional culture that shaped the delegates and debates that would forge the nation’s enduring Constitution in 1787. <strong>When:</strong> June 17. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC and online. </span></p>
