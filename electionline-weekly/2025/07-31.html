														<p><strong>Indian River County Mobile Voter Program<br />
</strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnership with local organization leads to success</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the Florida Legislature passed </span><a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/90/BillText/er/PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB90</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which among other things, required mail voters in the Sunshine State to submit a new mail ballot request each General Election cycle – previously mail ballot requests were typically good for two general elections.  </span></p>
<div id="attachment_13097" style="width: 242px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13097" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-13097" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IndianRiverPPP1-232x300.png" alt="" width="232" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IndianRiverPPP1-232x300.png 232w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IndianRiverPPP1-792x1024.png 792w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IndianRiverPPP1-768x993.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IndianRiverPPP1.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /><p id="caption-attachment-13097" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Indian River County Mobile Voter Packets.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2022 General Election cycle, </span><a href="https://www.voteindianriver.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indian River County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had 42,000 mail ballot requests on file. On Jan. 1, 2023, all vote-by-mail requests expired as a result of the new legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Supervisor of Elections Leslie Swan, as 2023 progressed, the office struggled to motivate voters to renew their mail ballot request. And with the then upcoming 2024 Presidential Election cycle, it was imperative that voters who typically vote-by-mail were made aware of the law change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swan said staff brainstormed ways to reach all voters about the law change, but especially the county’s senior voters who may not be as plugged into social and traditional media. From those staff brainstorming sessions came the Mobile Voter Program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supervisor of elections team formed a partnership with the </span><a href="https://www.seniorresourceassociation.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Resource Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SRA) to deliver election information to those who may be homebound or have limited mobility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senior Resource Association is recognized as the lead agency in Indian River County for promoting home and community-based services to older adults and transportation for all. Services offered by the Senior Resource Association include congregate meal sites, Meals on Wheels, Community Coach buses, and the GoLine Public Transportation system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By partnering with this remarkable organization, the supervisor of elections team could personally engage those served by the Senior Resource Association,” Swan wrote in her 2024 Professional Practice Paper submission to the Election Center. “During our initial meeting with the Director of the Senior Resource Association, we discussed the different services offered by the SRA and the number of program participants. We estimated that we could reach approximately 1,800 individuals served by SRA.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_13149" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-13149" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-13149" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IRCMobileVoter2-300x193.png" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IRCMobileVoter2-300x193.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IRCMobileVoter2-768x495.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IRCMobileVoter2.png 816w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-13149" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Delivering Mobile Voter Packets to a congregate meal site.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program centered around connecting with traditionally harder-to-reach Indian River County residents by going mobile and providing them with a Mobile Voter Packet. Elections staff assembled 1,800 Mobile Voter Packets. The packets contained a vote-by-mail request form, a voter registration application and return envelope for new voters and those needing to update their voting information, Voter Guide, Government Officials Guide, Frequently Asked Questions brochure, pen, American flag and a sweet treat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reaching eligible voters is crucial, but often, many individuals face barriers to accessing voting information due to lack of mobility or transportation,” Swan wrote in her PPP submission. “By engaging these individuals, it ensures their voices are heard, upholding the democratic principle of inclusivity and representation for all citizens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the early months of 2024, SOE staff were on site for the Senior Resource Association’s Congregate Meal Program, which provides meals five days per week for approximately 300 people at five separate locations throughout the county. All in attendance at the meal sites were provided a Mobile Voter Packet and the opportunity to have their voting questions answered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13148" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IRCMobileVoter-226x300.png" alt="" width="226" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IRCMobileVoter-226x300.png 226w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IRCMobileVoter-770x1024.png 770w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IRCMobileVoter-768x1021.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IRCMobileVoter.png 794w" sizes="(max-width: 226px) 100vw, 226px" />SOE staff also participated in the Meals on Wheels program.  Elections staff rode along with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meals on Wheels volunteers delivering hot lunches to seniors at their homes and providing them with vote-by-mail applications and miscellaneous election information contained in the Mobile Voter Packet. More than 500 informational packets were delivered to homebound individuals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also as part of the ongoing mobile program, supervisor of elections staff traveled on the Senior Resource Association’s GoLine, a no-cost public transit system. The team at the elections office rode on several bus routes, providing riders with SOE contact cards and offering riders the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">opportunity to renew their vote-by-mail ballot request and even register to vote. Informational signs were displayed inside GoLine buses for riders to view while traveling on the bus. The signs displayed a QR code directing bus riders to renew their vote-by-mail ballot request, register to vote, or update their voter record via the supervisor of elections website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senior Resource Association also operates the Community Coach, a door-to-door transit system for eligible riders with no other means of transportation. Community Coach Drivers distributed more than 1,000 Mobile Voter Packets to riders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Mobile Voter Program represents a proactive and effective solution to the challenges many of our county residents face. I commend the Supervisor of Elections staff for their dedication to fostering greater civic engagement and voter turnout in our community and am confident that their efforts will have a lasting positive impact,” said Karen B. Rose Deigl, president and CEO Senior Resource Association. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of the 1,800 Mobile Voter Packets was $1,582, a per person cost of .88¢. Swan said that while yes, they could have mailed these individuals information about renewing their vote-by-mail request, but the Mobile Voter Packets provided one-on-one interaction and allowed the recipients to feel socially connected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By going mobile, voting awareness was personally delivered to our harder-to-reach residents of Indian River County,” Swan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the small size of the elections office in Indian River, Swan said the partnership with SRA was critical and she advised other counties interested in doing a similar type of outreach to form a solid community partnership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The advice that I would give to other counties/jurisdictions would be to identify a community partner who provides services throughout the county.  By partnering with this organization, the Elections Office team can target and engage the folks who receive services from the community partner organization,” Swan said. “Community partnerships  offer a range of mutual benefits that improve service delivery, build trust, and provide opportunities to reach diverse populations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the success of the 2024 Mobile Voter Program, Swan said her team at the Indian River County Supervisor of Elections office is currently brainstorming  to roll-out another community partnership focusing on the medical field for 2026.</span></p>

Plankey — currently a senior adviser to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem — explained his vision for leading an agency that has experienced major workforce cuts and faces significant budget reductions in the Fiscal Year 2026 spending proposal. According to Cybersecurity Dive, the sharpest exchange of the Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing came when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, asked Plankey about the false claims that the 2020 presidential election was “rigged” by Democrats who stole the election. “I have not reviewed any of the cybersecurity of the 2020 election,” Plankey said. When Blumenthal pressed him, Plankey added, “My opinion on the election as an American private citizen is probably not really relevant.” That response angered Blumenthal, who said, “You are the head of the federal agency that oversees the security of our election system for the entire nation, and you’re telling me, in effect … you’re going to evade that responsibility,” Blumenthal added. “I think that answer is completely unsatisfactory.” Plankey pushed back, saying he would maintain CISA’s focus on helping state and local election officials secure their technology. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 30, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee voted 9-6 to </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/cisa-cybersecurity-elections-senate-confirmation-plankey-trump-8178049eafcdb5cf047fb5545746a3dd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advance Plankey’s nomination</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

David Jennings, who oversees policy and technology operations for the SAVE program, addressed the state election directors. According to Votebeat, Jennings told election officials that SAVE does not store citizenship and immigration information in a centralized database. Rather, he said, it’s a search tool that “queries information for a person from 10 to 15 databases across the federal government.” Several more states – </span><a href="https://www.wqad.com/article/news/politics/illinois-politics/trump-administration-requests-voter-data-illinois-elections-board-capitol-news/526-45c09646-1c1d-4946-960f-24e2dd02e81e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illinois</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2025/07/29/trump-administration-requested-voter-data-secretary-bellows-says-go-jump-in-the-gulf-of-maine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/minnesota-secretary-of-states-office-says-it-will-not-share-voter-registration-list-with-the-doj/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://kjzz.com/news/local/lt-governors-office-receives-dept-of-justice-request-for-utah-voter-information"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – reported receiving requests from the U.S. Department of Justice for access to voter and election data. </span></p>

On July 26, 1775, members of the Second Continental Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin the first American Postmaster General at a meeting in Philadelphia. The</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-postal-service-250th-anniversary-f3767d7216b8779a95a6b27cd8082737"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Postal Service has grown </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from serving the 13 colonies to delivering more mail than any other postal system in the world, reaching nearly 169 million addresses and employing more than 635,000 people. The Postal Service moves mail by planes, hovercraft, trains, trucks, cars, boats, ferries, helicopters, subways, bicycles, mules and feet with an average of 371.3 million mailpieces being processed and delivered each day. The Postal Service and elections have a long history with vote by mail starting with Civil War soldiers. </span><a href="https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2024/1202-usps-releases-2024-post-election-analysis-report.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 99.22 million ballots were processed in the General Election with 97.73% of ballots delivered from voters to election officials within three days.

Montana was selected out of submissions from 12 states. Before this year, Montana state law offered three ways to cancel the voter registration record of a deceased voter: quarterly vital statistics reports; an obituary published in a physical newspaper; and a death certificate provided to an election office.  To expedite the receipt of information on deceased voters, in 2024 the Montana Secretary of State’s office partnered with the Montana Funeral Directors Association to create and distribute an informational pamphlet to provide to families at funeral homes.  The pamphlet provides step-by-step instructions for canceling a deceased voter’s registration.  For election officials, this provides an opportunity to update the voter registration list months or sometimes years before state or federal vital records information is available to them. A second pillar of the program, which was not considered in scoring due to the Award’s timing criteria, was the passage of legislation spearheaded by the Secretary’s office in early 2025 to permit the usage of online obituaries as a mechanism to cancel a voter registration record. NASED President Bryan Caskey said: “On behalf of NASED, I am proud to present the 2025 NASED Innovators Award to the Montana Secretary of State’s office for their Death of Loved One initiative.  Though we all approach it differently, voter registration list maintenance is a responsibility every election official in every state and territory takes seriously.  It is an integral part of our jobs: accurate rolls contribute to voter trust in the election process and allow election officials to more efficiently deploy resources, from printing the right number of ballots to having enough voting equipment and election workers.  I am proud to recognize Montana’s innovation and creativity – this is exactly the kind of effort we hope to encourage among our members.” Director of Elections and Chief Legal Counsel for the Montana Secretary of State Austin James said: “Montana set a goal to be a national leader in election integrity.  We are honored that our effort to innovate and make Montana’s voter rolls the cleanest in the country is being recognized by election leaders from around the country.”</span></p>

However, comparatively little attention has been paid to the painstaking efforts undertaken by election officials and other government bodies in every state to thoroughly investigate these claims. Available evidence suggests that, once under scrutiny, the number of alleged instances falls drastically. Despite the heightened national awareness and concern brought about by these allegations, it appears that there has been no systematic nationwide effort to analyze them to date. The Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research (CEIR) conducted a rigorous search, analyzing government, media, and other public sources in all fifty states to compile an expansive list of allegations of noncitizen registration and voting, as well as the results of official investigations into such allegations. The resulting compilation reveals several notable insights, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>No “apples to apples” comparisons</strong>: Allegations about noncitizen registration and voting vary significantly across states and with respect to major factors, including the methodology and level of evidence on which the allegations are based. For example, some states announce the number of records flagged by cursory reviews for possible noncitizen registrants, while other states only publish the number of records removed after a thorough investigation. The latter numbers are invariably far smaller. This methodological inconsistency not only contributes to the confusion in public discourse, but it also restricts this analysis to discussing only broad trends.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Scrutiny almost always shrinks claims</strong>: High-profile claims of large numbers are highly likely to be significantly revised down after proper investigation and scrutiny. Often, these investigations reveal that initial claims were based at least in part on outdated, incomplete, or improperly matched data. However, the smaller numbers that result from these investigations generally receive far less public attention.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Claims represent tiny fractions of voters</strong>: Even the largest claims never allege numbers that amount to more than a few tenths of a percent of the number of eligible voters in a state. This indicates that existing safeguards are broadly effective, allowing election officials and other authorities to focus on investigating a relatively small number of records where there are alleged concerns.</span></li>

Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia) unveiled the measure, titled the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-discrimination-democrats-supreme-court-gop-d4238972cbb94cb9ce02e59aae643f2c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with the backing of Democratic leaders. The bill stands little chance of passage in the Republican-led Congress, but it provides the clearest articulation of Democrats’ agenda on voting rights and election reform. The legislation would reestablish and expand the requirement that states and localities with a history of discrimination get federal approval before changing their voting laws. It would also require states to allow same-day voter registration, prevent voters from being purged from voter rolls if they miss elections and allow people who may have been disenfranchised at the ballot box to seek a legal remedy in the courts. Democrats first introduced the updated Voting Rights Act in 2021, when the party had unified control of Congress. The bill came in response to several years of states enacting restrictive voting laws following the Supreme Court’s 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder. The bill passed the House twice in that Congress but failed to pass the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate. Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama reintroduced a House version in March.</span></p>

The initiative was approved by voters last year and called for </span><a href="https://wtop.com/dc/2025/07/dc-council-approves-2026-budget/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked choice voting and open primaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in D.C. Ahead of the first vote, the council agreed to fund half the measure, allowing for ranked choice voting but not open primaries. The system allows voters to rank more than one candidate on a ballot. At-large Council member Anita Bonds and Ward 5 Council member Zachary Parker were among those who proposed amendments that opted for studying how to set up ranked choice voting before choosing to pay to implement it. Ward 2 Council member Brooke Pinto introduced one amendment that would have fully funded Initiative 83. “Just two weeks ago, we implemented the first half of Initiative 83 with a supermajority of us. This amendment just seeks to implement the other half of ranked choice voting, as was passed by 73% of D.C. voters, to have semi-open primaries, to allow independents to vote in our primary system,” Pinto said. However, the measure failed.</span></p>

The Americans for Citizen Voting initiative was recently approved by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers, and on Wednesday the effort kicked off its signature gathering campaign with the aim of getting the constitutional amendment on the 2026 general election ballot. The measure would require all voters to show a photo identification in order to cast a ballot. A big issue surrounding the debate on voter ID is the potential barrier such a requirement could place on those who don’t have ID readily available or those who might not be able to afford it. Organizers have anticipated that talking point, and the measure would provide free ID cards for those facing hardships. The initiative would also establish that the secretary of state must verify that only U.S. citizens are registered to vote, and mandate that the Michigan Department of State regularly review and purge voter rolls of individuals whose citizenship status cannot be verified. Supporters and organizers will need more than 440,000 valid signatures to get the measure on the ballot.</span></p>

The wide-ranging bill contains a mixture of requests from conservative activists, Republican state lawmakers and the newly Republican-led State Board of Elections, which came under GOP control this spring after the legislature stripped Democratic Gov. Josh Stein&#8217;s power to appoint a majority of election board members. Several of the changes in the new bill are aimed at allowing that new GOP majority on the board to flex its political muscles ahead of the 2026 elections, in part by removing the legal protections that State Elections Board staffers have long had against political motivations behind them being hired or fired, or otherwise receiving rewards or retribution. The bill would also exempt the elections board from some public records laws. And it would allow the board to hire private attorneys for lawsuits instead of using state government lawyers from the attorney general&#8217;s office.</span></p>

The commissioners were presented July 24 with a proposal to move to a </span><a href="https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/25/multnomah-county-approves-ranked-choice-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked-choice voting system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the midterm election in 2026. The director of elections in the county says this would simplify voting for Oregonians living in Multnomah County because it is already how Portland runs its city candidate elections. The commissioners voted unanimously to move the county to a ranked-choice system, so midterm ballots will look a little different in 2026.</span></p>

A similar proposal stalled out just before the finish line during the regular session, with the House and Senate unable to agree on how quickly the attorney general should be allowed to take the case from local authorities. This time around, both chambers are starting from the same spot on that issue, directing the attorney general to immediately step in and take over election fraud cases. But a potential new line of disagreement has opened. In setting the agenda for the Legislature’s ongoing special session, Gov. Greg Abbott asked lawmakers to grant this authority to the attorney general with a constitutional amendment, after Texas’ highest criminal court ruled in 2021 that the state constitution bars the agency from unilaterally inserting itself into criminal cases. A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote from both chambers — including 12 House Democrats — and final signoff from voters to take effect. In the House, Plano GOP Rep. Matt Shaheen took up that call, filing a joint resolution to accompany his bill. Sen. Bryan Hughes, the Mineola Republican carrying the Senate version of the bill, said during a hearing he does not believe a constitutional amendment is necessary.</span></p>

However, in some cases, information included in the cast vote record could be used to piece together information and determine a voter’s identity. In court documents, Maricopa County argued Arizona law prevents counties from disclosing the cast vote record. Julian agreed. In an order signed last week, Julian found that state election law exempts the cast vote record from Arizona’s Public Records Law, which allows the public to inspect most government records in the state. She cited</span><a href="https://azleg.gov/ars/16/00625.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that requires election officials to ensure the security measures used to secure “electronic data from and digital images of ballots…are at least as protective as those prescribed for paper ballots.” “CVRs, which reflect how each ballot was tabulated, are electronically derived from voters’ marked ballots. As such, they are explicitly covered by section 16-625 and cannot be disclosed to members of the public through a public records request,” Julian wrote. The judge found that the county should not have disclosed the record in the past. “The County acknowledges that it previously disclosed CVRs from the 2020 election, and that those prior CVRs are available through third-party repositories,” Julian wrote. “However, the fact that prior disclosures may have occurred in contravention of section 16-625 does not render the statute unenforceable or justify new violations.”</span></p>

It’s the latest ruling from the 8th Circuit, saying only the government can bring lawsuits alleging violations of the Voting Rights Act. The findings upend decades of precedent and will likely be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The case centered on whether an Arkansas law that limits how many voters can be assisted by one person conflicts with Section 208 of the landmark federal law. The opinion from the three-judge panel followed the reasoning of another 8th Circuit panel in a previous case from 2023. That opinion held that the Arkansas State Conference NAACP and the Arkansas Public Policy Conference could not bring cases under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. “Like the provision at issue in Arkansas State Conference, we conclude the text and structure of (Section) 208 do not create a private right of action,” said the decision written by Judge L. Steven Grasz, a nominee of President Donald Trump. “Likewise, we conclude no private right of action is created by the Supremacy Clause.”</span></p>

The original suit, brought by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas, challenges the constitutionality of state laws governing the petition and referendum process. The League also is gathering signatures to qualify its proposed ballot measure for the 2026 ballot. The League and Protect AR Rights, one of two ballot question committees intervening in the suit, are both pursuing ballot measures aimed at protecting Arkansans’ right to direct democracy. Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids, a ballot question committee pursuing an education-related ballot measure, filed a complaint, motion for preliminary injunction and brief in support of the motion Thursday. The coalitions requested a hearing on the motion, a preliminary injunction to block the laws and an order requiring the secretary of state to count and verify any otherwise legally valid signatures that don’t comply with the challenged laws. The laws the groups are asking a judge to block are: </span></p>

Benson has provided some of the material sought by the Republican-led Michigan House Oversight Committee but has expressed concerns that some of the information requested could end up in the wrong hands. The House filed its lawsuit against Benson in June, arguing that they have a right to review the material to ensure that election officials receive proper training that complies with Michigan election law. Patel ordered the parties in the case to appear for mediation with Court of Claims Judge James Robert Redford, requiring Benson and House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland, to attend unless they have a valid excuse. The order followed a July 22 hearing during which Patel made the ruling from the bench. Two weeks before the mediation conference, the parties in the case must list the remaining materials subpoenaed that the Secretary of State&#8217;s office hasn&#8217;t delivered with a description of each.</span></p>

The suit, filed in 2022 by the Spirit Lake Nation, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and three tribal citizens, accuses a legislative district map adopted by North Dakota lawmakers in 2021 of unlawfully diluting the power of Native American voters. The judgment would do two things: make it so that private citizens in the 8th Circuit can’t sue under a law that bans racially discriminatory voting practices, and pave the way for North Dakota’s district lines to revert back to the 2021 map.  Now that the Supreme Court has stepped in, voters in the seven 8th Circuit states will still be able to bring lawsuits under the statute, known as Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, at least until it decides the North Dakota case. The order also likely means North Dakota’s district lines will remain the same for the 2026 election cycle. The current map — which puts the Turtle Mountain and Spirit Lake reservations in the same district — was adopted in 2024 after the tribes convinced U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte that the 2021 map was discriminatory. The plaintiffs asked the U.S. Supreme Court to freeze the current map in place as they prepare to appeal the 8th Circuit’s decision to the high court. July 24’s order solidifies a shorter stay on the judgment the Supreme Court issued last week.</span></p>
