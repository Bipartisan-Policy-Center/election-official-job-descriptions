														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>From Scarcity to Safety</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitigating Turnover Among Local Election Officials</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By</span><a href="https://www.umsl.edu/gradschool/ppa/directory/liao-yuguo.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yuguo Liao</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, PhD, Associate Professor of Political Science and Public Policy Administration,</span><a href="https://www.umsl.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> University of Missouri-St. Louis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and<br />
</span><a href="https://www.umsl.edu/political-science/directory/kimball-david.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> David C. Kimball</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, PhD, Professor of Political Science,</span><a href="https://www.umsl.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> University of Missouri-St. Louis</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local election officials (LEOs) are vital to maintaining trust and efficiency in the democratic process. However, turnover intentions among LEOs are concerningly high, with environmental challenges like resource scarcity and safety concerns significantly influencing decisions to leave their positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the work our</span><a href="https://www.umsl.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> University of Missouri-St. Louis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team conducted in conjunction with the</span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Elections &amp; Voting Information Center (EVIC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and EVIC’s principal researchers</span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/about-evic/#founder-director-paul-gronke"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paul Gronke, PhD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, (</span><a href="https://www.reed.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reed College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and</span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/about-evic/#research-director-paul-manson"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paul Manson, PhD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, (</span><a href="https://www.pdx.edu/center-for-public-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Public Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at</span><a href="https://www.pdx.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Portland State University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), we studied resource scarcity and safety concerns and their impact on LEOs’ decisions about leaving their positions. The EVIC team helped facilitate our work by integrating some of our research questions into their</span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/2024-evic-leo-survey-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2024 EVIC Local Election Official Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regard to resource scarcity, our research has shown that limited funding affects nearly 30% of all LEOs of all sized jurisdictions, rising to over 40% in mid-sized jurisdictions, leading to work exhaustion and decreased job satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In looking at LEO safety concerns, we found that more than 65% of LEOs report facing verbal or online harassment, and 30% have experienced direct threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the face of these ongoing challenges, we wanted to understand: (1) how workplace conditions (resources and safety) influence LEOs’ turnover decisions, focusing on job satisfaction as the underlying mechanism, and (2) why some LEOs remain despite challenges, examining how psychological empowerment and public service motivation shape the impact of these challenges on LEOs’ job satisfaction and, ultimately, their turnover intentions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our findings show the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adequate resources to conduct the election and educate voters can reduce LEOs’ turnover intentions.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety concerns indeed increase LEOs’ turnover intentions.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job satisfaction acts as a psychological bridge between workplace conditions (resource availability and safety) and turnover decisions, which explains more than half of the estimated impact of workplace conditions on LEOs’ turnover intentions.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LEOs express relatively high levels of psychological empowerment and commitment to public service. They feel psychological empowerment meaning LEOs feel autonomous, competent, and impactful in their roles. The following figure shows the proportion of LEOs who agree about positive features of their job:</span></span><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12670" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newser04.30.25A.png" alt="" width="616" height="425" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newser04.30.25A.png 788w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newser04.30.25A-300x207.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newser04.30.25A-768x530.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">LEOs report high public service motivation expressing a commitment to serving the public. The following figure shows the proportion of LEOs who agree about the importance of the following values:</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12671" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newsers04.03.25B.png" alt="" width="713" height="448" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newsers04.03.25B.png 824w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newsers04.03.25B-300x189.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Newsers04.03.25B-768x483.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When LEOs feel highly psychologically empowered, they feel a strong sense of autonomy and competence, which makes the availability of external resources less important for their turnover decisions.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when resources are scarce, LEOs with high public service motivation may make them feel a deep sense of misalignment between their aspirations and the reality of their work environment, pushing them to leave.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">LEOs with high psychological empowerment and high public service motivation are sensitive to safety concerns. As a result, even small safety concerns could lead to a stronger decline in job satisfaction, which in turn makes them more likely to leave the position.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on our this research, we make the following policy recommendations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address Environmental Challenges by increasing funding for election administration to alleviate resource scarcity, and strengthen legal protections and penalties for threats and harassment.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengthen Job Satisfaction Monitoring by implementing regular job satisfaction surveys to identify emerging dissatisfaction before it escalates into turnover. Establish feedback mechanisms that allow LEOs to voice concerns about resources and safety in real time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengthen Psychological Empowerment to reduce resource dependence. Provide leadership development, autonomy, and professional growth opportunities to help LEOs feel more in control of their roles. Recognize and celebrate LEOs’ contributions to reinforce their sense of competence and purpose.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address Resource Gaps to retain high-public service motivation LEOs. Secure consistent funding for election administration to prevent frustration among high- public service motivation LEOs who are deeply committed to public service.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhance Safety Protections for high-public service motivation and highly empowered LEOs. Implement comprehensive safety protocols, including increased security at election offices and clear reporting mechanisms for threats. Strengthen legal protections and enforcement against harassment and intimidation targeting election officials. Provide mental health resources and peer support networks to help LEOs cope with safety-related stress.</span></li>

The legal challenges had been expected after election lawyers warned some of the demands in the order, including a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration and new ballot deadline rules,</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-executive-order-elections-voting-constitution-8908477167fd65dc9cd485e1fde5b804"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may violate the U.S. Constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

The SAVE Act places an unfunded, unworkable, and legally risky burden on election administrators without offering the necessary resources or implementation support. We urge you to oppose this bill and instead work with election officials to develop policies that strengthen election security without jeopardizing administrative efficiency or exposing election personnel to legal liability.”</span></p>

By and large, things ran smoothly on Tuesday although there were some scattered issues. In </span><a href="https://www.nbc26.com/news/local-news/voting-resumes-despite-early-morning-setbacks-in-green-bay#google_vignette"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Bay Wisconsin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an early morning power outage on the city’s west side affected power at three different polling locations for a short moment. All the tabulators at those locations have batteries that allowed voters to still insert their ballots. A court order extended polling hours in the </span><a href="https://www.wsaw.com/2025/04/01/kronenwetter-extending-polling-hours-after-earlier-technical-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Village of Kronenwetter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until 9 p.m. due to technical issues earlier in the day. The extension follows a petition filed by Marathon County Clerk Kim Trueblood and Village of Kronenwetter Clerk Jennifer Poyer, after technology issues caused significant delays at the Kronenwetter Municipal Center earlier on Tuesday. “To the best of my understanding, the electronic poll books were experiencing some delays in getting people checked in to vote. So, when voters would come in, present their driver’s license, there was a lag in that electronic poll book system. So it was taking a long time for voters to get checked in,” Trueblood said. At least seven </span><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/04/01/ballot-shortages-reported-at-some-city-of-milwaukee-polling-sites/82766798007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milwaukee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> polling places ran out of ballots due to an &#8220;historic turnout&#8221; for a spring election, according to Melissa Howard of the Milwaukee Election Commission. Election officials increased field staff and sent ExpressVote machines that are used at early voting to those locations, along with additional ballots, she said. Online </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/briefs/rumors-of-ice-agents-at-polling-places-appear-unfounded/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rumors that ICE agents were patrolling in the areas of polling places</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Milwaukee and Madison seemed to be unfounded. Spokespersons for Milwaukee and Madison city government told Wisconsin Examiner that they have not heard any reports, complaints, or notifications about ICE agents at polling places. A spokesperson for the ICE office in Milwaukee said, “due to our operational tempo and the increased interest in our agency, we are not able to research and respond to rumors or specifics of routine daily operations for ICE.” And voters in Wisconsin voted overwhelmingly to enshrine the state’s existing </span><a href="https://www.wpr.org/news/april-2025-election-voter-id-requirement-passes-wisconsin-constitution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voter ID law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the state constitution.

The Escambia County Supervisor of Elections Office alerted the media at 7 p.m. as polls were closing − and published a notice on its website − acknowledging the issue and assuring voters that every vote would be counted. &#8220;Due to unprecedented voter turnout in today’s Special General Election for U.S. House of Representatives, District 1, some precinct locations in Escambia County have experienced temporary ballot shortages,&#8221; the notice said. In Mississippi, which held municipal elections this week, voters in </span><a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2025/04/01/a-lot-of-us-are-confused-lacking-info-some-jacksonians-go-to-wrong-polling-place/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were confused due to changes in polling locations. The confusion stemmed from thousands of Jackson voters having new precinct locations after redistricting last year put them into a new city council ward, and some voters didn’t realize their polling place for the municipal elections may differ from where they voted in last year’s national elections, which are run by the counties. Angela Harris, the Jackson municipal clerk, said her office worked to inform voters by mailing out thousands of letters to Jacksonians whose precincts changed, including the roughly 6,000 whose wards changed during the 2024 redistricting. “I am over-swamped,” she told Mississippi Today.

The receiving and returning manager for the First Assembly precinct in Ward 3 signed for a sealed and locked ballot box at the city registrar’s office Monday evening and took it home. But 6am came and went. There were no ballots. “We couldn’t find him,” Election Commissioner Julie Parker told The Dispatch. “We couldn’t get him on the phone. When we finally did, he told us his car was gone that had everything in it. … Only in Columbus.” Parker said new ballots arrived and voting began by 7:30. Jammie Garrett, chief operations officer for the city, said four voters left during that 30-minute gap but said they would return to vote before polls closed. Garrett confirmed the election worker’s vehicle had been repossessed. She tracked it to a recovery yard in Columbus, where the election worker retrieved the ballot box and returned it to the registrar’s office.</span></p>

In addition to documenting the abysmal overall turnout – with more than four in five voters not participating &#8211; the report found that Universal Vote at Home (VAH) states produced nearly double the turnout rate of non-Vote at Home states in primary elections. In regular State Primary Elections, where voters chose Republican and Democratic party nominees for the November general election, only 44 million of an estimated 235 million eligible citizens cast ballots, or less than 1 in 5. In contrast, in Universal Vote at Home states, where every active registered voter is automatically delivered a ballot, aggregate primary election turnout levels were approximately double those in traditional  site based/polling-place states. In these jurisdictions, the combined turnout was 30% of eligible citizens and 34% of registered voters, compared to 16% and 19% in non-VAH states. This super minority of voters determine the results of primary races that are now so important that they effectively choose an estimated 90% of winners for top federal and state offices. The NVAHI analysis also revealed that the median age of 2024 primary voters nationwide was 65. Voters 65 and older had a six-times higher turnout rate (36%) than those aged 18-34, who had just a 6% turnout. VAH states consistently showed higher voter turnout across all age groups.</span></p>

Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat, said. The Colorado Voting Rights Act also includes protections for LGBTQ+ voters, expands multilingual ballot access, and requires accommodations for people with disabilities at residential facilities. The attorney general’s office will be able to enforce the act so Colorado voters don’t need to depend on the federal government to enforce the VRA. Gonzales sponsored the bill in the Senate, where it will need to pass one more vote before it goes to the Colorado House of Representatives for further debate. House sponsors are Assistant Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat, and Rep. Junie Joseph, a Boulder Democrat. Democrats hold strong majorities in both chambers.</span></p>

Current state law doesn’t allow for RCV in primary or general elections. The group was chaired by State Senator Tony Hwang (R-Fairfield). He testified in support of the bill. “I believe that Senate Bill 1536 will modernize our electoral system and help move Connecticut toward a more inclusive and fair voting process. Ranked-choice voting has the potential to bring about a more representative democracy, reduce polarization, and allow for a healthier and more engaging political environment for all voters,” Hwang stated in his testimony. The legislation would only allow ranked-choice voting in party caucuses, conventions, and primaries, and it would be optional for municipalities and parties to adopt.</span></p>

Darius Brown (D-New Castle) </span><a href="https://www.delawarepublic.org/politics-government/2025-03-30/dem-lawmakers-re-up-efforts-to-add-mail-in-and-early-voting-to-delaware-constitution"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reintroduced efforts to add early voting, mail-in voting and permanent absentee voting to the Delaware Constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a similar attempt failed last year. Mail-in voting, same-day voter registration, permanent absentee voting and early voting have all been struck down by Delaware courts in recent years. Only early voting and permanent absentee voting returned after the Delaware Supreme Court found the plaintiffs in that case lacked proper standing, but the merits of the case remain untouched. Voting rights advocates and some lawmakers argue this leaves the right to early voting and permanent absentee status unprotected, unless the voting procedures are added to Delaware’s Constitution. Brown introduced a constitutional amendment addressing those two voting procedures — along with no-excuse or absentee voting — last year, but with Republicans claiming support only for early voting and not permanent absentee or mail-in voting, the amendment failed. Brown is trying again this year, this time with two separate amendments: one for early voting and one for absentee voting. Part of what makes the voting rights codification process unusually complicated is the fact that Delaware, unlike many other states, has the six excuses necessary to request an absentee ballot request outlined in the state constitution, rather than in its code. Those excuses include being in the public service of the United States or of Delaware — or being a spouse or dependent of someone in service — the nature of one&#8217;s business or occupation, sickness or physical disability, absence from the district while on vacation or religious reasons. Brown&#8217;s constitutional amendment would void these excuses and allow anyone to request an absentee ballot as long as they are a qualified voter. The amendment would also enshrine permanent absentee status, allowing voters to register to receive an absentee ballot for every election without having to file individual requests. This provision is largely for members of the military or those with physical disabilities.</span></p>

Fort Myers Republican Jenna Persons-Mulicka presented her bill (</span><a href="https://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=82105&amp;SessionId=105"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1381</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) before the House Government Operations Subcommittee. It now has two more stops before going to the floor. The measure contains numerous provisions ostensibly to ensure that only U.S. citizens vote. It says that if an applicant has not provided the necessary evidence of their legal status, or is not verified before the applicant requests a vote-by-mail ballot or presents to vote, the applicant must be provided a provisional ballot that can be counted only if they confirm their legal status by 5 p.m. on the Thursday after a Tuesday election. The bill also says that a supervisor of elections must remove the name of a deceased voter from the voter rolls within seven days if they receive a copy of a death certificate or a published obituary or notice of death, a letter of probate or estate administration, or “personal knowledge” of a registered voter’s death. Other provisions include: The state’s division of elections office can use lists from federal agencies or other state governments to remove voters from the rolls. It requires jury coordinators for federal jury duty to create a list of those disqualified for not being U.S. citizens and to provide it to the Florida Division of Elections according to the jury summons cycle used by the court clerk. Eliminates certain categories of voter identification options such as student identification, debit or credit cards, and retirement cards. Changes from “challenge” to “protest” voter challenges of vote-by-mail ballots. In a manual review of ballots open to the public, the bill says that each political party may designate one person with “expertise in the computer field” who must be allowed in the central counting room where all tests are being conducted and where the official votes are being counted. Requires all voting to be by paper ballot, unless a person with a disability requires a voter-interface device. Would make Florida the first state in the nation to require an automated, independent vote validation process for every ballot cast in every election before certification.</span></p>

GOP legislators backed away from one of their most contentious proposals, which would have required a hand count of ballots on election night. The provision no longer appears in either bill following opposition from county election directors. The State Election Board tried to mandate the hand count last year, but a judge ruled the board exceeded its authority. The bills advanced in separate House and Senate committee votes, with legislators voting along party lines.Republicans supported the legislation and Democrats opposed it. To become law, the bills would have to pass both chambers before the Georgia General Assembly adjourns April 4. “We’re not giving everybody everything they’ve asked for,” said House Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Victor Anderson, a Republican from Cornelia. “We’ve done so much with elections over the last four years. The provisions we call for in this bill are fairly common sense and justified.” Both measures,</span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/397"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 397</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/SB/175"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 175</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, call for Georgia to quit a 24-state partnership called the Electronic Registration Information Center, which exchanges voter information between states to identify outdated registrations. The bills also prevent new State Election Board rules within 60 days of an election, a response to the Republican-led board’s attempt last fall to require hand ballot counts and change requirements for certifying results. And the legislation would prohibit counties from accepting in-person delivery of absentee ballots the weekend before an election. That practice led to complaints by the Republican Party last year. In addition, cities would be able to decide not to allow early voting on Saturdays for municipal elections. The Senate’s elections bill goes further, giving the State Election Board custody of the secretary of state’s election investigation reports and requiring after-hours video surveillance of drop boxes at early voting locations.</span></p>

A pair of bills sponsored by Athens-area Republicans were sent back to committee this week. With the end of the legislative session Friday, the bills will not make it to the floor. Representative Houston Gaines introduced House Bills 851 and 852 last week. The bills sought to abolish the Board of Elections in Athens-Clarke County and change the way its members are appointed. On Monday, the bills were pulled from the House and recommitted to the Intragovernmental Coordination Committee. In a statement, Representative Houston Gaines said that discussions would resume in the fall to address the “legal and policy issues with the current makeup of the Board.”</span></p>

Democrats see it as disenfranchising young voters in a state with already dismal voter turnout statistics. Republicans see it as enhancing election security. The section of the law this bill proposes editing is the Photo ID law passed in 2005. When voters cast their ballot on Election Day, they need to show a photo ID that has four components: A name matching their voter registration, a photo, a valid expiration date and the ID needs to be issued by the state or federal government. Student IDs from state colleges can be used, so long as they have these four elements.</span></p>

Mike Freiberg (DFL-Golden Valley), a committee co-chair,</span><a href="https://www.house.mn.gov/bills/billnum.asp?Billnumber=HF1378&amp;ls_year=94&amp;session_year=2025&amp;session_number=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HF1378</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.house.mn.gov/comm/docs/6UkxBWrOn06-Z9uTOdF7vg.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as amended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was then approved on a voice vote and sent to the House floor. Among the provisions in the bill, there would be </span><a href="https://www.house.mn.gov/sessiondaily/Story/18693"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wholesale changes in the way Minnesotans apply for absentee ballots, vote early and in the way those votes are handled and counted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Starting with the application process, online absentee ballot applicants would be required to provide both a Minnesota driver’s license or state identification card number and the last four digits of their Social Security number to verify identity. Mailed and online absentee ballot applications would need to be received at least seven days before an election. If an application is received within seven days of Election Day, the absentee ballot board would be required to attempt to contact the applicant by telephone or email to notify them of other opportunities to vote in the election. rather than the entire 46-day absentee voting period. Once absentee ballots are received, the bill would require the absentee ballot boards to verify the number of envelopes and ballots at various stages of the counting process, which would start at the end of each day. To ensure more election security, the bill would require counties to develop a chain of custody plan for handling election-related materials, including absentee ballots, that would need to account for both the physical and cybersecurity of materials.</span></p>

England, the Senate Elections Committee Chairman, had sought to pass an early voting bill that would allow for no excuse, 15-day voting prior to an Election Day, effectively ending the need for absentee voting in Mississippi. As it stands now under the compromise, an in-person excused voting period will begin 22 days before the date of each primary, general, runoff, special and municipal election for public office and continue until 12:00 p.m. on the Saturday immediately preceding the election day. Under current law, voters had 45 days to cast an absentee ballot. Voters with an excuse to do so early would be allowed to cast their ballot in-person in the clerk’s office or at another secure location designated by the local governing body under the new bill. Valid excuses for voting early in the bill are similar to what has been in practice for absentee voting in the past with the addition of Sanford’s language regarding that of anticipating being at work and being a caretaker of a child, disabled person, or senior citizen was added in the measure. Clerks will be able to extend the hours of from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. during the final week leading up to an election day and remain open from 8:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m. for the two Saturdays immediately preceding each election. Both chambers overwhelmingly adopted the conference report on the legislation, with the House passing it 111-0 and the Senate 42-7. There has been no word from the governor on whether he will sign this new legislation into law or veto it.</span></p>

Under the bill, a group can appeal the secretary of state’s summary. The court can make recommendations, but the secretary of state must revise the language within seven days. That received a House Elections Committee hearing this week would make it more difficult for judges to rewrite a secretary of state’s ballot summary. “To me this is a gross overstepping of the judiciary branch,” bill sponsor Sen. Rick Brattin, R-Harrisonville, said at the hearing. If the court finds that summary unfair, the secretary gets five days to write another draft. This process can happen one last time, and upon third revision the secretary gets just three days. Only then, if the court still finds the summary unfair, can a judge rewrite it. The back-and-forth process must take place on a set timeline prior to the general election. Brattin’s original bill eliminated the court’s ability to rewrite a ballot summary, he said at the committee hearing, but he worked with Senate Democrats to amend it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House advanced legislation that would </span><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/missouri-house-backs-return-to-presidential-primary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinstate state-run presidential preference primaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and extend the no-excuse absentee voting period from two to six weeks. Supporters of</span><a href="https://house.mo.gov/Bill.aspx?bill=HB126&amp;year=2025&amp;code=R"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 126</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cited a widespread positive response to the recently enacted no-excuse voting period as a motivating factor. They also noted negative feedback on the 2024 party-run caucuses, which replaced the state-run primaries after they were eliminated as part of a law passed in 2022. The no-excuse absentee voting period has been in effect since August 2022 and allows voters to cast their ballot in elections in person or by mail starting two weeks before Election Day. Supporters of the bill said they hoped that extending the no-excuse voting period would further alleviate stress on election workers and encourage voters to cast their ballot. The state of Missouri ran March presidential primaries from 2000 until 2020. A 2022 law signed by former Gov. Mike Parson eliminated them. In 2024, the Republican Party held in-person caucuses in Missouri to select their delegates, while Democrats opted for a hybrid caucus with in-person voting and a mail-in ballot. Low participation in these caucuses, alongside vocal blowback from residents who preferred the state-run primaries, were cited as motivators for reinstating the primaries.</span></p>

But Democrats complained about a </span><a href="https://www.wvxu.org/2025-03-27/transportation-budget-including-ohio-voter-registration-change-and-more-awaiting-dewines-action"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voter registration provision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the bill. And that apparently has raised questions for DeWine as well. According to WVXU, the Senate added to the transportation budget a provision the House had dropped; proof of citizenship for people who register to vote at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. House Republicans had put in that provision initially, but then compromised with Democrats by changing it to a ban on BMV employees and deputy registrars from offering registration forms to people who are ineligible. Without threatening a veto, he repeated something he’s said before—that he would need to be persuaded to sign another election-related law.  “I think the burden of proof is on anyone who wants to issue wants to change it,&#8221; DeWine said. &#8220;We’ve changed it a few times. We&#8217;ve done some different things. I&#8217;ll take a look at that one that gets to me.”</span></p>

If</span><a href="https://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=hb1005&amp;Session=2500"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 1005</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> becomes law, all </span><a href="https://www.okhouse.gov/posts/news-20250327_4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voter identification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cards must include a photo of the voter beginning in 2027. Under the bill, Service Oklahoma would be tasked with working with the Secretary of the State Election Board to develop and provide a free photo identification card that meets HB1005&#8217;s requirements. &#8220;Oklahoma&#8217;s elections are among the safest in the nation, and House Bill 1005 presents another opportunity to safeguard the integrity of our elections,&#8221; Olsen said. &#8220;By requiring a photo ID for all voters, we are securing the votes of all Oklahomans and enhancing transparency and accountability in our elections. I appreciate the support of my colleagues in the House as we work together to protect Oklahoma&#8217;s elections.&#8221; These identification requirements would apply to both in-person absentee voting and Election Day voting. HB1005 passed the House floor 75-18 on March 27 and now moves to the Senate, where it is carried by Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers are considering a bill that could change the way elections work statewide. Rep. Mike Osburn (R-Edmond) calls</span><a href="https://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=hb2106&amp;Session=2500"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 2106</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a “common sense” voting bill. He introduced the bill with a simple goal &#8212; </span><a href="https://www.kxii.com/2025/03/28/oklahoma-lawmakers-considering-election-reform-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make election season easier for both voters and election boards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. House Bill 2106 would designate five recurring election days each year. Those days would be scheduled in February, April, June, August, and November. Osburn said holding more elections in less days on a set annual schedule would keep the voters engaged while at the same time making election season more efficient. Major election dates like last November’s presidential election would not be affected, and the governor would have the power to call special elections under specific circumstances. Absentee and early voting processes would also stay the same. Earlier this week, the bill passed in the Oklahoma House 92-0. It will now go before the senate.</span></p>

The bill then requires the secretary of state’s office to make those digital images available on its website no later than the second Friday after an election. It is unclear if the ballot images that would be on the secretary of state’s website would be available for public viewing. The bill would change the deadline for purging the state&#8217;s voter rolls to 90 days before an election. During a subcommittee meeting on March 25, State Representative Tim Rudd, one of the main sponsors of the legislation, said the change would make Tennessee’s purge deadline compliant with federal law and said any future changes to maintain compliance would not require any amendments or votes. The bill would also ban all forms of online voting and ban all voting machines from being connected to the internet. If passed, the law would take effect on July 1, 2025.</span></p>

The bill still needs approval in the House before it can become law. It would cost state officials nearly $2 million over the next five years to implement, according to the bill’s fiscal note, which doesn’t include any costs expected to be borne by local election officials. </span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB16"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 16</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, written by state Sen. Bryan Hughes, and supported by all Senate Republicans, is modeled after an Arizona law that requires proof of citizenship to vote in state and local elections, but there are some important differences. For one thing, it would apply to already registered voters in Texas, rather than just new applicants. It would bar voters who don’t provide citizenship proof from voting in presidential elections, as well as state and local ones — a provision that federal courts have so far blocked in Arizona. And it prescribes new duties for local election officials to continually check the citizenship status of voters on their rolls — with potential felony charges for lapses. If approved by the Legislature, the new law would go into effect in September. Some election officials are concerned that the bill’s requirements will confuse voters. “It’s not enough time to get everyone familiar with the requirements. We have a primary in March” of 2026, said Jennifer Doinoff, president of the Texas Association of County Election Officials. “It could create a huge influx in provisional ballots.”</span></p>

Taylor County Elections Administrator Freda Regan presented the resolution in response to a number of State House and Senate bills that have been introduced this legislative session, which aim to do away with county-wide polling, cease the use of electronic polling books, and revert back to paper ballots rather than ballot marking devices. Regan said this resolution is just one of many 66 other Texas counties have formally submitted. “There are counties that are not currently in the [County-wide polling] program that have also submitted the same resolution. Because they want the ability to apply to be a part of it,” Regan said. Regan says that Taylor County would have to increase the number of polling places, as well as pay more volunteers to run those locations, to be able to have one polling location in all 34 Taylor County voting Precincts. While this would increase the number of total locations, it would restrict voters to only the area within their precinct. Regan said she believes returning to that system would be much less convenient, resulting in voter confusion, lower voter participation, and potentially void provisional ballots if a vote is cast outside a voter’s assigned precinct.</span></p>

Representing themselves, Hobbs and Ladd described the case as an &#8220;urgent matter.&#8221; Hobbs requested Judge Benjamin Hanna to set a hearing date, but her request was denied. Judge Hanna explained that because they had just filed amended paperwork, defense attorney Christopher Pisano needs time to prepare a response. After the proceedings, Hobbs expressed understanding of the delay, saying, &#8220;It is okay. I think that it will be heard on its merits and the citizens will have a chance to present what they witnessed during this last election cycle, the laws that were violated.

According to Totenberg’s ruling, the plaintiffs in Curling v. Raffensperger were not able to demonstrate that the state’s electronic voting system disenfranchises them from exercising their right to vote in elections. She wrote that the election activists Coalition for Good Governance and Georgia voters lacked standing in the lawsuit. Totenberg also wrote that some of the plaintiffs’ legal objections to the touchscreen ballot marking devices are more about policy disagreements rather than constitutional violations. Totenberg, however, wrote that she has substantial concerns about the electronic voting technology that has long faced allegations about the risks of being hacked and potentially compromising elections in Georgia. The state’s electronic Dominion Voting Systems machines were rolled out statewide in 2019, but by that time the state was already involved in the pre-emptive federal court legal battle with the Coalition for Good Governance and other individual plaintiffs who claim that the electronic system is vulnerable to cyber attacks and operational problems that violate voters’ constitutional rights. Totenberg credited the plaintiffs’ role in providing evidence that exposed a major breach of election equipment in Coffee County following the 2020 election. “Today’s ruling is just one more resounding vindication of Georgia’s elections,” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said. “From day one, we knew these accusations were meritless. All the real-world evidence shows that Georgia’s paper ballot system works well. Our local election officials are professionals. And the voters of this state know that their votes are counted securely, accurately, and quickly.”</span></p>

North Carolina is one of 14 states that bans photographing a “voted official ballot” or voters without the permission of election officials. The restrictions are intended to prevent vote buying, voter intimidation, delays and distractions at polling places and to maintain the privacy of other voters.  Hogarth took a selfie with her filled-out ballot when she voted in primaries last March, which she posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. The state board of elections then mailed her a letter directing her to take the post down and informing her that she had violated state law. When she returned to the polls in November armed with a court order allowing her to take ballot pictures, she was instructed by polling place staff to stop taking photos and delete them — before staff called the state elections board to confirm that she had an exemption.</span></p>

The outcome of the case, which has been making its way through the courts for nearly four years, will have implications for how much power Texans will have to decide who represents them in the state Legislature and U.S. Congress. The voting-rights coalition said it decided against continuing the litigation after its claims were dismissed by a trial-court panel of federal judges in February, following a ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that experts said upended longstanding precedents. The coalition that withdrew included Fair Maps Texas Action Committee, OCA-Greater Houston, the North Texas chapter of the Asian Pacific Islander Americans Public Affairs Association, Emgage Texas, and 13 individual voters. They are represented by the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, the ACLU of Texas, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Brennan Center for Justice. Their case had been consolidated with that of other plaintiffs who were also challenging the maps. The remaining claims are still set to go to trial beginning May 21.</span></p>

Join The Elections Group and the AI + Elections Clinic at Arizona State University’s Mechanics of Democracy Laboratory on April 8 at noon EDT via Zoom for this timely conversation about what it means to be AI-aware in election administration and how to thoughtfully experiment with emerging technologies in your office. This webinar will focus on the practical side of using AI in elections: how to approach AI with the right mindset, build foundational skills, and evaluate the growing number of tools available. We’ll discuss real-world examples of how AI can assist with routine tasks like drafting communications, organizing information, and identifying trends, while also addressing key risks, limitations and ethical considerations. Panelists include Bill Gates, the executive director of the Mechanics of Democracy Laboratory at Arizona State University’s Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions and a former Maricopa County, Arizona, Supervisor; Tonya Wichman, the director of the Defiance County, Ohio, Board of Elections; Diana Bowman, the associate dean for applied research and partnerships and a professor of law at Arizona State University’s Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law; and Noah Praetz, the president of The Elections Group. <strong>When,</strong> April 8 at 12pm. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>

Maya Wiley, President and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and Virginia Kase Solomón, President and CEO of Common Cause, will join Levitsky in a discussion about what the strategies of pro-democracy movements are in this moment, whether they will be enough, and what else can be done.
