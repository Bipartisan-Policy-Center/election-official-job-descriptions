</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubuque Co, IA auditor’s office builds unique partnership for voter outreach</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voter outreach is one of the core functions of an elections office. And it’s not just about getting out the vote on Election Day. It’s reminding voters about checking registration, getting up-to-date absentee ballot information, learning mail-in voting deadlines, and finding their polling location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13172" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DubuqueIAPPP2-76x300.png" alt="" width="76" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DubuqueIAPPP2-76x300.png 76w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DubuqueIAPPP2-259x1024.png 259w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DubuqueIAPPP2.png 330w" sizes="(max-width: 76px) 100vw, 76px" /><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13171" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DubuqueIAPPP1-73x300.png" alt="" width="73" height="300" />Voters require this information and getting it to them in an easily understood package is paramount for them to have the best voting experience possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reach, update, and educate voters where they are, the </span><a href="https://elections.dubuquecountyiowa.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubuque County, Iowa Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> office partnered with the </span><a href="https://www.dubcolib.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubuque County Library</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system and the </span><a href="https://carnegiestout.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carnegie-Stout Public Library</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the City of Dubuque to distribute Your Vote Matters bookmarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Former Auditor Kevin Dragotto and I were at a conference, and there was a speaker who was presenting on disability rights,” explained Jenny Hillary, CERA, deputy auditor, commissioner of elections in Dubuque County. “They had created a bookmark to distribute with information on disability rights. Auditor Dragotto and I pretty much looked at each other simultaneously and stated that we should create a bookmark, but have voting information on it. Auditor Dragotto stated we should go a step further and distribute them to the libraries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Hillary, annual visits to libraries in the U.S. averaged 1.2 billion visits over that last ten years. An American Library Association report issued in November 2023 found that Gen Z and Millennials are visiting libraries at higher rates compared to older generations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13173" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DubuqueIAPPP3-201x300.png" alt="" width="201" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DubuqueIAPPP3-201x300.png 201w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DubuqueIAPPP3.png 548w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px" />“This presents a unique opportunity to expand our reach to an underperforming segment of the electorate,” Hillary said. She said the libraries in Dubuque were immediately onboard with the idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning in 2023, whenever someone checked out a book at one of the libraries, a bookmark was placed inside for the patron to have. Additional bookmarks were available as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each two-sided bookmark had a checklist for voters to help them prepare for election day. Included on the checklist side is a QR code to take the voter to a more detailed website. Local contact information was clearly listed on the opposite side including the county elections website, email, and social media addresses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to distributing the bookmarks, Hillary said the libraries also created social media posts to promote the bookmarks which led to great voter reach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the county’s Election Center Professional Practice Paper submission, the feedback on the bookmarks was so positive that they intend to run this program annually in the months leading up to election day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Website traffic increased, social media interaction increased, and we experienced positive references to our bookmarks,” Hillary wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bookmarks were $112 per 1,000 bookmarks and that included two colors and printed on both sides. The design work was completed in-house, using standard design software that most offices would already have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It truly is a minimal cost to implement. You can use a simple computer program to produce them or find a printing vendor with a template for a bookmark. It is a fun way to get election information and your contact information out to the public,” Hillary said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county is planning to bring this back in 2026 and since they already have two bookmark styles out now, they’d love to create a new design for 2026 and possibly expand distribution like local bookstores, Hillary said. </span></p>

Several states, including </span><a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2025/08/05/maryland-responds-to-feds-request-for-voter-data-with-step-by-step-guide-to-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maryland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2025/07/31/trumps-doj-wants-utah-voter-data/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have responded to the DOJ request by providing them with the steps necessary to obtain the publicly available information. While the DOJ has already reached out to at least </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-election-officials-voting-trump-a04b1522bed0cb6bbc286e25b139701f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">19 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context. “DOJ staff told NASS staff that </span><a href="https://stateline.org/2025/08/01/doj-plans-to-ask-all-states-for-detailed-voting-info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all states would be contacted eventually</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” association spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline. In at least two instances in California, the DOJ has requested information about the removal of non-citizens from voter registration lists in </span><a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2025/08/06/doj-wants-non-citizen-voter-registration-requests-including-sensitive-data-from-los-angeles-county/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12050403/sf-officials-push-back-as-doj-seeks-data-on-voters-removed-over-citizenship-rules"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. NBC News has a report on states’ inability to rely on the </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/less-staff-even-less-trust-states-say-cant-rely-trumps-dhs-election-se-rcna220855"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Homeland Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for election security. Three state election heads and a former CISA official who spoke to NBC News said it’s clear the agency is no longer as effective in protecting U.S. elections. “You’re hanging states out to dry, basically, to let them fend for themselves,” said Pam Smith, the president of Verified Voting, a nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to providing election officials with resources for their jobs.</span></p>

The Board voted to decertify two </span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/08/06/arkansas-board-of-election-commissioners-decertifies-two-phillips-county-election-workers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips County </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">election workers, one of whom did not show up to the hearing, and issue them letters of reprimand for failing to fulfill their duties. The board decertified Phillips County Election Commissioner John Dalencourt for four years and poll worker Dennis Jasper for 14 years after hearing testimony from others who worked at the voting site in the small town of Elaine during the November 2024 elections. Delancourt faced sanctions for not being present at the polling place at 6:45 a.m. on Election Day, which was Nov. 4, at the direction of the state board after a similar issue in 2022. The board also held Dalencourt responsible for the polling place not being open at 7:30 a.m. as required. The board initially considered decertifying Dalencourt for 14 years but reduced the punishment. The Board also issued letters of reprimand to three election officials of the </span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/08/06/north-arkansas-election-commissioners-reprimanded-but-not-decertified-over-election-law-breaches/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Searcy County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Election Commission but declined to decertify them from working on future elections after several hours of testimony and debate this week. Attorney Clint Lancaster represented all three members of the Searcy County Election Commission in their challenge of the state board’s June decision to decertify Chairwoman Laura Gross and commissioners L.C. Ratchford and Ken Weekley for 14 years over four allegations of violating state election law in November 2024. The state board sanctioned the three commissioners on two of the four allegations, issuing one letter of reprimand per charge and per commissioner. The first was “accepting something of value from an unapproved source” in the course of their duties. The county’s election officials used audiovisual equipment — television monitors, cameras and scanners — provided by the Arkansas Voter Integrity Initiative to help observers monitor the vote counting. The second allegation was that the commission failed to post a full list of election workers in a public space in the county clerk’s office at least eight days before Election Day.</span></p>

The officials — about 10 leaders from Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and Argentina — asked Broward Supervisor of Elections Joe Scott about Florida’s voting rules, including how voting works for snowbirds who live in both the state and New York. The visitors walked around the elections office’s new headquarters in northern Fort Lauderdale. Scott said as people from abroad learn about Broward’s election efforts, “it means a lot that some of the innovative approaches that we’ve taken over the last few years are getting recognition even beyond the United States.” The visitors’ tour was coordinated by the Argentinian organization, Transparencia Electoral, in collaboration with the Florida International University. Jesús Delgado Valery, the program director for the organization, said the group has led more than 60 electoral observation missions, including one tour in Los Angeles — and yet Broward was a standout. “It’s not that regular that they have these kinds of offices and technology,” Valery said. Scott said the building was in the process of being planned when protesters rioted at the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021. “It really made us think about the fact that people might try to storm our building,” Scott said. “They might even feel like they have the patriotic duty to come in and disrupt what we’re doing.” Ivan Castro, the Broward Supervisor of Elections’ communications manager, said one benefit to welcoming the international election officials was the chance to understand how elections are run in centralized systems, in contrast to the decentralized structure the U.S operates.</span></p>

He announced a new “I Voted” sticker competition on August 4. Open to all registered voters in Mississippi,  the contest will serve as a component of the secretary of state’s “Promote the Vote” program. Mississippians will have the opportunity to express their creativity and promote civic engagement through this year’s contest. Anyone 18 years and older who is registered to vote in Mississippi is encouraged to design and submit artwork to be used as the “I Voted” sticker for all 82 counties during the 2026 election cycle. “I am thrilled to bring this contest to Mississippi voters through the expansion of Promote the Vote,” Watson said. “Combining artistic expression and pride for our beloved state is a great way to engage our voters while highlighting the creative talent of Mississippians.”</span></p>

One of the more concerning misconceptions around the order is that it &#8220;bans&#8221; voting systems that encode votes into barcodes or QR codes &#8212; a misconception with potentially major ramifications for voting system procurement and voter trust ahead of 2026. In the explainer, BPC explains what the VVSG are, what the executive order attempts to do, and why the executive order alone cannot ban certain types of voting equipment. Their hope is that this can be a helpful resource when explaining what the executive order does (and does not do) to voters, policymakers, and the media.</span></p>

Attempts to </span><a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/new-restrictions-voter-registration-are-likely-harm-young-voters"><span style="font-weight: 400;">change voting policies at the federal level</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like the SAVE Act which passed the House of Representatives in April 2025, have the potential to drastically alter the voter registration landscape across the country. Similar legislation at the state level may also present major challenges to engaging young voters. In a new analysis, CIRCLE breaks down what the impact of policies like automatic voter registration could have on young voters and explores the potential challenges of proposed new requirements like proof of citizenship. Key findings include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70% Register at the DMV or Online: Some of the most common registration methods could be affected by new restrictions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youth Move Twice As Often: More than 1 in 4 young people have moved in the past year, which often requires reregistering.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than Half of Youth Have Passports: Young people of color and low-income youth are less likely to have proof of citizenship.</span></li>

CIRCLE has previously studied the differences in barriers to voting by race and education, as well as issued recommendations for increasing youth voter turnout among underrepresented groups. In this new analysis, CIRCLE highlights how those barriers shaped participation in the 2024 election, in an attempt to understand the voting experience of various youth and how to support them in future elections. Key findings include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 in 3 Lacked Time or Information to Vote: 31% of youth who didn&#8217;t vote said they were too busy, had conflicts or commitments, or didn&#8217;t have enough information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial Struggles are a Barrier: Youth who missed registration deadlines or ran out of time were twice as likely to have trouble making ends meet.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Youth Are Less Likely to Vote Absentee: Just 25% of Black youth voted by mail, pointing to inequities in access to convenient voting methods.</span></li>

Good signage makes voting easier for everyone. It helps people move through the space smoothly, find the right table or room, and know what to expect next. It also saves time for poll workers by answering common questions before they’re asked. But designing good signage takes more than printing out a sign that says “Vote Here” and taping it to a wall. This nonpartisan resource is for election offices of all sizes. Whether you’re designing signs for a brand-new voting location or improving what you already have, this guide will help. In addition to signage guidance and best practices, the toolkit also includes templates you can use to create your own signs. We’ve designed them to support 2 languages (English and Spanish or another language of your choice.  These templates will give you a head start and come in different sizes to fit the needs of your polling location.  There are 2 types of signs, directional signage and informational signage. Directional signage helps people navigate a space, while informational signage provides specific instructions or other information to support understanding and confidence at decision points.</span></p>

The measure was first pitched by former President Barack Obama when he was still a U.S. Senator. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/08/07/on-60th-anniversary-of-voting-rights-act-mcclellan-introduces-bill-to-strengthen-it/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">would help quash practices intended to trick would-be voters into either not exercising their right to cast a ballot, or voting for a candidate opposite their party affiliation or values. Such deceptive practices include when false information is disseminated about the time, place or eligibility requirements for voting. McClellan’s legislation would also require the U.S. Department of Justice to report to Congress about the amount and types of deceptive practices it investigates and prosecutes. Updating the previous version Obama carried, McClellan’s bill also aims to address new challenges posed by artificial intelligence-generated disinformation. “I will fight to protect everyone’s right to vote from these new threats,” McClellan said in a statement. Obama’s bill, which failed to advance in Congress, followed incidents where deceptive practices were used to recruit field workers and distribute flyers with false endorsements by Black regional figures of Republican congressional and gubernatorial candidates. The bill was also later carried by McClellan’s predecessor, the late Don McEachin and others and remains timely, McClellan said, to try again.</span></p>

They’ll still hold public testimony on the topic on Aug. 18. Assembly member Ella Adkison proposed the local ordinance earlier this summer and advocated for its adoption at the meeting. She said the system aligns with Juneau’s values and it will encourage more people to run for local office. “It really is good for races where there are lots of candidates in one seat,” she said, “I think Juneau, in general, likes having lots of candidates in races, because it means that the person that they feel represents them the most is the person who actually gets onto the Assembly.” It’s already too late for the system to be implemented for this October’s municipal election, but Assembly members worried that adopting it now might confuse voters anyway. Assembly member Alicia Hughes-Skandijs said she supports ranked choice voting, but wants to wait until there’s less going on. If the system is approved, Juneau would become the first major city in Alaska to adopt ranked choice voting for municipal elections.</span></p>

He also deleted a paragraph that said the secretary of state could finalize the state’s election results without a particular county’s results, if that county’s officials missed the state deadline to finalize them. According to Votebeat, the inclusion of those provisions in the previous edition of the manual, released in 2023 ahead of the 2024 elections, drew Republican lawsuits alleging that Fontes had exceeded his authority, and courts ruled against him. Fontes said that he has to follow court orders and that he believes the new version will still protect voters and the integrity of elections. “We’re trying to walk the line between some of the crazy rulings that we’ve seen coming out of the court that seem to protect the First Amendment rights of people who would scream at voters in line, and those First Amendment rights of voters to peaceably assemble, with this new approach,” Fontes said. Fontes’ draft manual includes some changes that voting rights groups have requested for years, such as detailing the rights of voters who don’t speak English well, and of incarcerated residents. Fontes is also using this manual to try to help election officials avoid problems that have come up in recent elections, such as ballot printing errors.</span></p>

The new law addresses a longstanding discrepancy. Under federal law, New Hampshire’s Secretary of State’s Office must own and operate those accessible machines, which allow voters with vision impairments and other disabilities to use a keyboard and audio cues to fill in and print out a ballot. But while federal law requires that those machines be available in all elections with federal candidates, it does not require the same for elections that are fully local, such as town meetings, annual school meetings, municipal elections, or special elections for the state House and Senate. Accordingly, for years, the Secretary of State’s Office did not supply cities and towns the machines for local elections, and most towns did not have them. This month’s law requires that all towns provide machines and also requires that the Secretary of State’s Office enter into agreements with all cities and towns in order to provide those machines.</span></p>

KSG Ministries filed a legal action late August 4 seeking an injunction that would block the vote, claiming authorities denied inmates their right to cast ballots. “Numerous individuals incarcerated in state and county custody are legal residents of Dothan, Alabama, and remain fully eligible to vote under Alabama law,” the lawsuit alleged. The suit, filed by KSG leader Pastor Kenneth Glasgow, claimed that lockup officials denied those inmates access to absentee ballot applications. Glasgow claimed that the lockups have failed to provide a policy allowing inmates not convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude to vote in this week’s elections that include races for mayor, commissioners, and city school board. Steensland refused to issue an order delaying the elections. He set an August 28 hearing to hear from those on both sides of the issue that potentially could affect a runoff next month.</span></p>

Smith surrendered to authorities July 31 after investigators with Attorney General Tim Griffin’s Election Integrity Unit obtained a warrant for her arrest. The State Board of Election Commissioners this spring referred a complaint it received from Pulaski County election commissioners about a possible election integrity violation. The state board asked the attorney general’s office and the county prosecuting attorney to investigate the switching of 132 voter registrations from North Little Rock to Maumelle ahead of the 2024 general election. “We determined during our investigation that Smith deliberately switched the voter registrations while employed at the clerk’s office. She is charged with one count of violation of voter eligibility, a Class D felony,” Griffin’s press release said.</span></p>

Social media giants like X Corp. challenged</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/x-corp-sues-california-over-online-election-deception-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Assembly Bill 2655</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which requires certain platforms to remove “materially deceptive content” about political candidates, elections officials and elected officers. They argued the federal Communications Decency Act gives service providers like social media platforms immunity from content posted by a third party. Mendez said from the bench that he didn’t need to rule on First Amendment and constitutional arguments, instead relying solely on federal preemption. However, his ruling only applies to qualifying parties in the suit — X Corp. and Rumble. “No parts of this statute are severable because the whole statute is preempted,” Mendez said. “No parts of A.B. 2655 can be salvaged.” The law — called the Defending Democracy from Deepfake Deception Act of 2024 — sought to stop the spread of election-related deepfakes. Its author had called such deepfakes dangerous tools for those waging disinformation campaigns.</span></p>

Both the company and a former employee directly accused by Oltmann have filed numerous defamation lawsuits over the false claims. Martinez ordered Oltmann to pay $37,000 for fleeing the courthouse during a deposition last year and cover $53,757 for plaintiff Eric Coomer’s litigation costs related to Oltmann’s non-compliance. Coomer is the former director of product security and strategy for Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems. </span></p>

The three-judge panel concluded the city cannot override its charter without a voter referendum. “(Miami) may not enact an ordinance which effectively amends its Charter without submission of the issue to the will and vote of its constituents by referendum,” the court wrote, declaring the ordinance “unconstitutional.” In its defense of the ordinance, City Attorney George Wysong cited state laws that allow municipalities to shift election dates by ordinance and referred to a previous court ruling in which a court upheld a similar date change in North Miami. But the court rejected that argument, pointing to Miami-Dade’s home rule protections, which require voter approval for any changes to municipal election schedules or term lengths.</span></p>

The Florida Decides Healthcare and FloridaRighttoCleanWater.org political committees, which are trying to put proposals on the 2026 ballot, and individual plaintiffs filed similar notices July 25. The notices are something of a counter to an appeal filed July 11 by Secretary of State Cord Byrd and Attorney James Uthmeier, the defendants in the lawsuit. Byrd and Uthmeier want the Atlanta-based appeals court to overturn a decision by U.S. District Judge Mark Walker that blocked one part of the law. </span></p>

Emerson said there is nothing in the law that supports the idea that commissioners can veto eligible nominees. “The Board shall appoint the two members as nominated by the county executive committee chairperson,” wrote Emerson. The decision comes after the Democratic-controlled Fulton Board of Commissioners rejected the two GOP nominees in a party-line vote in May. The Georgia Republican Party sued the commission, arguing the commission is legally obligated to accept the party’s nominations. Jason Frazier, one of two GOP appointees, has lodged thousands of voter eligibility challenges in Fulton. And the other party nominee, Julie Adams, an incumbent election board member, voted against certifying last year’s primary election. Fulton Commissioner Marvin Arrington, who voted against the appointments of Adams and Frazier to the elections board in May, criticized the judge’s ruling. “This ruling essentially eliminates our discretion as elected commissioners, treating us more like record-keepers than decision-makers,” he said.</span></p>

One person is accused of voting as a non-citizen, while the other allegedly voted while still on felony probation. These arrests are part of Idaho&#8217;s comprehensive voter roll review, initiated following a 2024 executive order aimed at ensuring only eligible citizens participate in elections. The review, spearheaded by the Secretary of State&#8217;s office, involved cross-referencing voter data with federal and state records. Officials confirmed that no voting machines or tallies were compromised during the process, and additional arrests are anticipated.</span></p>

Louisiana, a lawsuit that non-Black voters filed against the state over the creation of a second majority Black district for the state in the U.S. House. The justices intend to look at whether a state violates the U.S. Constitution when it seeks to remedy a violation of the Voting Rights Act.  In the order, the court asked parties to the case to answer “Whether the State’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.” The 14th Amendment, in part, covers representation in Congress, and the 15th Amendment prevents citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their race. If the justices determine Louisiana violated the constitution with its latest congressional map, it could undermine the Voting Rights Act. The legislation was approved in 1965 to bolster the protections granted in the 14th and 15th Amendments. It has been amended five times since then to strengthen its provisions, though voting rights advocates note federal court rulings over the past decade have chipped away at the law.</span></p>

Five unaffiliated Maryland voters filed suit in May and asked a judge to declare that restrictions on primary elections are a violation of the state constitution. Elections officials, in a response filed Wednesday afternoon, asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed citing a lack of standing and a “failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” In his response on behalf of the board, Daniel Kobrin, an assistant attorney general, wrote that a challenge based “solely as taxpayers” is insufficient to establish standing for such a challenge. The motion filed by Korbin also asks the judge to declare that the five voters have no right to challenge the restrictions on primary elections because of previous court decisions. Kobrin noted two decisions by the Supreme Court of Maryland that said “voters have no right under the state constitution to vote in the primary elections of a party to which they do not belong.” In another case, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld closed primaries and a political party’s First Amendment right “not to associate” and therefore cannot be required to allow unaffiliated voters to participate, according to the motion filed by the board’s attorney Kobrin, in his motion, writes that “the merits of the unaffiliated voters’ challenge have already been rejected.”</span></p>

The opinion was signed by Judge Philip Mariani, Judge Allie Greenleaf Maldonado and Judge Adrienne Young. The lawsuit said Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Bureau of Elections Director Jonathan Brater issued election guidance that granted voter status to people who didn’t live in Michigan, targeting overseas and military voters’ spouses and adult children. The Court of Claims ruled against that argument in October 2024, and said it was an 11th hour Hail Mary attempt by the MIGOP and the RNC to disenfranchise the state’s voters before the upcoming November 2024 general election. It was dismissed by Judge Sima Patel, an appointee of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Patel denied Benson’s request for sanctions, however. The parties filed in the Court of Appeals, which on Wednesday affirmed the lower court’s decision.</span></p>

Burkman and Wohl are accused of orchestrating a series of robocalls aimed at suppressing Black voters in Detroit during the 2020 election. The men discouraged Detroiters from voting in the general election by creating robocalls in late August of 2020. The calls went out to nearly 12,000 residents with a Detroit zip code, officials say. “After five years, I’m glad this case has finally reached a resolution,” Nessel said. “Deceptive and racially targeted suppression schemes will not be tolerated in Michigan. My office will continue to pursue and prosecute voter intimidation, no matter how long it takes, to ensure that Michiganders can exercise their right to vote free from fear and deception.” The two men were charged in 2020 and bound over for trial. The duo attempted to quash the charges, but the Court of Appeals ruled the state’s conduct was constitutional. The two pled no contest to: One count of election law – bribing/intimidating voters, a 5-year felony; One count of conspiracy to commit an election law violation, a 5-year felony; One count of using a computer to commit the crime of election law – intimidating voters, a 7-year felony; and Using a computer to commit the crime of conspiracy, a 7-year felony.</span></p>

The board said the Nov. 4 date was the “earliest available date that fully complies with Missouri election law,” according to court documents. In an emailed statement, White thanked the court for moving the date back, but criticized the idea of holding a recall at all, which he said would be costly. “If this effort is ultimately allowed to proceed, it will be a $5 million mistake — one I believe Jackson County voters will not forget.

In their motion to dismiss, the county alleges that Burgess was grossly incompetent and accused her of violating federal and state law requiring deactivations for the county’s voter list. They also accused Burgess of issuing a defective sample ballot, attempting to execute an illegal plan for “unofficial” drop boxes at designated churches, fraudulently charging overtime for non-mandatory social events, and that she demonstrated extremely deficient election law knowledge. The county also says Burgess refused to acknowledge employee contributions, made inappropriate remarks, and told another employee she was going to punch her in the throat, which the filing says she dismissed as a joke. Burgess was terminated in February. Burgess subsequently filed the suit against the county, claiming disability discrimination, retaliation, emotional distress, fraud, defamation and conspiracy.</span></p>

McShane called Judicial Watch’s allegations “speculative” and found they don’t allege that voter fraud is occurring or that any inactive voter received a ballot or cast one in error. In contrast, he found the Constitution Party had adequately raised a real harm, contending that the state’s “outdated” voter registration lists have made it harder for the party to track whether its members’ registrations are active to maintain its standing as a minor political party able to nominate candidates. “The Constitution Party has plausibly alleged that outdated or inaccurate voter lists impair a core function of that organization,”McShane wrote in a</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26040855-judicialwatchmcshaneruling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 23-page opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

The panel ruled unanimously that the requirement the Texas Legislature enacted in 2021 as part of an election-integrity bill known as SB1 did not violate a federal law preventing states from imposing voting requirements “not material” to the validity of ballots. In a brusque, nine-page opinion, Judge James Ho twice said the appeals panel had “little difficulty” concluding that Texas’ law was valid. “The number-matching requirements are obviously designed to confirm that every mail-in voter is who he claims he is,” Ho wrote for the panel. “And that is plainly material to determining whether an individual is qualified to vote.” The judges said that merely requiring applications to list the voter’s name and address was insufficient to address security concerns. “That information is easily available to anyone who simply requests it,” wrote Ho, a Trump appointee. “As a result, any person can request and receive that information about a registered voter, use that information to apply for a mail-in ballot, and then cast the ballot, with minimal risk of detection.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin over </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2025/08/06/virginia-court-of-appeals-rules-naacps-voting-rights-foia-lawsuit-against-youngkin-isnt-over/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to records concerning his administration’s changes to voting rights restorations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can move forward. Because a previous ruling by a Richmond judge that sided with the governor never addressed the attorneys fees that had been part of  NAACP’s lawsuit, the appellate court has decided the case is not closed. “We dismiss the premature appeal without prejudice and remand the matter to the trial court to consider the attorney fee issue,” the court’s judges wrote</span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/static/opinions/opncavwp/0264242.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Virginia Conference of the NAACP had originally filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the governor’s office seeking further details about how it handles restoration of voting rights to people with felony convictions who have completed their sentences. In Virginia, people with these convictions permanently lose their right to vote unless a governor pardons them or they petition a governor to restore the right. Previous governors — both Republican and Democratic — had worked to streamline the process and make it automatic upon completion of a prison sentence. The process quietly reverted to a petition-based one under the Youngkin administration, with fewer petitions granted than previous governors and unclear criteria for what would yield a “yes” or “no” from his administration. The lack of transparency in the restoration process is why Virginia’s NAACP filed its original records request.</span></p>
