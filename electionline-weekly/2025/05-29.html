</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections research continues in 2025 with focus on AI in Elections</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By R. Michael Alvarez, PhD<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flintridge Foundation Professor of Political and Computational Social Science, Caltech<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-Director, Linde Center for Science, Society, and Policy at Caltech<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-Director, Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-12912" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech1.png" alt="" width="208" height="222" />​​It’s hard to believe that we are almost halfway through 2025 and that it has been almost a year since the team at the</span><a href="https://lindeinstitute.caltech.edu/research/lcssp"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Linde Center for Science, Society, and Policy at Caltech (LCSSP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> officially launched</span><a href="https://www.protectingtheelection.us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Caltech Election Integrity Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back in July 2024 with</span><a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2024/07-25/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> my last by-line in electionlineWeekly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We originally intended for this program to conclude next month, but we have extended our research and dissemination of findings through at least the end of 2025 so that we can further engage with election practitioners and other election community stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This engagement includes the upcoming October 16-17, 2025 conference &#8211;</span><a href="https://polisci.wustl.edu/protecting-election-ai-governance-conference"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Protecting the Election: AI and Governance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; that I’m co-organizing with my colleague</span><a href="https://polisci.wustl.edu/people/betsy-sinclair"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Betsy Sinclair, PhD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Assistant Vice Provost of Digital Transformations, Thomas F. Eagleton University Professor of Public Affairs and Political Science, and Chair of the Political Science Department at</span><a href="https://washu.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Washington University (WashU)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who is hosting the event on campus at WashU.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12913" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech2-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech2.jpg 448w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We’ll get into more on the upcoming conference later at the close of this article, but it is the resulting follow-up meeting to our very successful and well-attended</span><a href="https://www.protectingtheelection.us/conference"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Information and Misinformation in Elections Conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> held online January 16-17, 2025. Conference topics were focused on the 2024 election and included how campaigns used innovative new approaches to target and persuade voters, how social media influenced voters, what the electorate knew (or did not know) about the candidates and issues, misinformation in the election, election rumors and denialism, rhetoric about election integrity, disinformation dissemination and impact on the election, conspiracy theories regarding the candidates and the administration of the election, and practitioner experiences with misinformation in recent elections. This conference, also co-organized with Professor Sinclair, and sponsored by the LCSSP, was scheduled to take place on-campus at Caltech. Unfortunately, the wildfires of Southern California, and specifically the</span><a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/eaton-fire"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eaton Fire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that struck Pasadena less than a week before our conference, had widespread and serious effects on the City of Pasadena,</span><a href="https://www.caltech.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Caltech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Caltech&#8217;s students, faculty, and staff, and our local infrastructure. Out of an abundance of caution and concern for our many traveling participants given the wildfire situation throughout Southern California, we quickly converted our conference to an</span><a href="https://www.protectingtheelection.us/conference"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> entirely virtual event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We re-opened registration and over 300 participants attended our event, over three times the number who were scheduled to attend <img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12914" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech3-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech3-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech3.jpg 506w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />in-person. This was a small upside to the devastating tragedy, but it told us there was a strong need to continue the conversations had during this virtual event.        </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to our paper presenters and modified virtual poster presenters (who are all listed on the</span><a href="https://www.protectingtheelection.us/conference"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conference website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we welcomed several speakers including three</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Election Assistance Commissioners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, keynote speakers</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lynn-vavreck-1624a48/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lynn Vavreck</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-stewart-iii-557b4a8/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Charles Stewart,III</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-lewandowsky-bb793b28/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stephan Lewandowsky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a panel of practitioners featuring California local election officials</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadona/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Natalie Adona</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommy-gong-99b65710/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tommy Gong</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dean-logan-05052a3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dean Logan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bob-page-46266a23/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bob Page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.calvoter.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> California Voter Foundation Executive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Director</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-alexander-17527717/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kim Alexander</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former local election official</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tina-barton-5536341b/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tina Barton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and election technology provider representative</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-smith-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ed Smith</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings us back to the topic of the upcoming Protecting the Election: AI &amp; Governance Conference at WashU on October 16-17 that I introduced above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12915" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech4-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech4-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech4-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CalTech4.png 524w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />We will hear from practitioners during the conference about their experiences with AI in recent elections. Two speakers who have been  confirmed to join us at WashU are former Washington Secretary of State</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-wyman-536b8b2bb/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kim Wyman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, President of ESI Consulting, Senior Fellow at the</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bipartisan Policy Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Former Senior Election Security Advisor at CISA, and Brianna Lennon, County Clerk in Boone County, Missouri and co-host of the</span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0JMKgKEdzhb2qFL2Dkyjkq"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> High Turnout – Wide Margins podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing the objective we established in our January conference, in October at WashU we will bring academic and industry experts, to learn from the latest research on how AI is altering election administration and election practice worldwide. The WashU conference will also focus on building collaborations and connections, between election officials and researchers, to help build useful and practical AI-enabled solutions to improve election administration and democratic discourse in upcoming elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, Professor Sinclair’s team at the WashU Department of Political Science officially launched our</span><a href="https://polisci.wustl.edu/protecting-election-ai-governance-conference"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conference website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where we  announced our Call for Papers, Posters and Panels. We are currently accepting paper, poster, and panel proposals that address the following research topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">     How chatbots can be used to engage with voters</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">     How social media influences voters</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">     What the electorate knew (or did not know) about the candidates and issues during recent elections</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Misinformation in elections</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Rhetoric about election integrity</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">     AI strategies for the administration of elections</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These proposals should be a maximum of 250 words and be submitted to lcssp@hss.caltech.edu by July 15, 2025. We expect to announce decisions no later than September 1, 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay tuned to the </span><a href="https://polisci.wustl.edu/protecting-election-ai-governance-conference"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conference website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for regular updates. You can also listen to a wonderful, informative conversation about this event on </span><a href="https://youtu.be/x7vL1yZjoBU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">yesterday’s edition of my Election Science Office Hours webinar where Betsy Sinclair joined me to discuss the conference in addition to AI in elections more broadly, and her other research interests and work at WashU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll wrap up this update by plugging</span><a href="https://www.protectingtheelection.us/office-hours"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Election Science Office Hours</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was originally scheduled to run through the November 2024 election. However, it has been so well received (and so much fun!) that we are continuing these thanks to the fantastic guests &#8211; a variety of members of the elections community &#8211; with whom I have had the privilege of hosting for 16 segments and counting. We have also turned Election Science Office Hours into a podcast that is available on</span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3iOqStgrPEoIxdo8GzV1PB"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Spotify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-election-science-office-hours-podcast/id1781465618"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apple Podcasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so for those of you looking for something engaging to listen to while running, gardening, or reading email, look no further!</span></p>

In 2022, the Office of Personnel Management issued guidance requiring agencies to provide federal employees with up to four hours of administrative leave to vote in federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial elections. Additionally, OPM clarified that employees could also use up to four hours of administrative leave per year to serve as a non-partisan poll worker or observer. In March of 2025, President Donald Trump signed </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/14248"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 14248</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revoking the paid time off. According to an article in Government Executive, agencies have begun notifying federal workers about the new policy. “Effective immediately, Forest Service employees are not authorized to use administrative leave to vote or participate in voting related activities,” said a message received by employees and obtained by Government Executive.  Other USDA employees reported being told verbally they could no longer use that form of paid time off for voting. The Interior Department has apparently removed implementation guidance on the leave-for-voting policy from its website. The Forest Service told employees they are still allowed to request taking their own personal vacation time for voting purposes. According to PR Week, the </span><a href="https://www.prweek.com/article/1919514/federal-election-assistance-commission-cancels-solicitation-pr-contract"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Election Assistance Commission has canceled a solicitation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seeking PR firms to provide comprehensive communications services. The agency search was canceled this month because the sole contracting officer is no longer working for the federal agency, according to solicitation documents from the government. There is no longer a “warranted contracting officer at the agency to process this procurement” as of May 12, the federal government said. The contract was set to run for one year, starting on September 1, according to solicitation documents, which did not include a budget. The contract sought PR and communications services in three sections: strategic media services, foundational collateral and content and social media. The RFP was released on April 24. </span></p>

In </span><a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/laramieboomerang/news/wyoming-gop-drops-lawsuit-against-laramie-county-clerk-debra-lee-over-voting-machine-test/article_69609e76-e2ed-4dd8-93c8-0fc566ea0030.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laramie County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the clerk’s office and the Wyoming Republican Party have settled a ten month long lawsuit filed against Clerk Debra Lee challenging the testing of the county’s election equipment used in the August 2024 primary. Lee told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle the county chose to settle because the litigation cost over $50,000 taxpayer dollars and hundreds of Laramie County Clerk staff hours. “When the Wyoming GOP offered to settle the complaint days before the hearing, we reluctantly agreed in order to put an end to this matter and not incur additional cost to taxpayers. The settlement included allowing three individuals — none of whom were from Laramie County — and a self-proclaimed ‘expert’ from out of state — to inspect documents previously offered by the Clerk’s office on several occasions, beginning as early as last September.” In </span><a href="https://wyofile.com/governor-wont-seek-weston-county-clerks-removal-for-2024-election-errors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weston County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Gov. Mark Gordon said Clerk Becky Hadlock’s actions in the 2024 election did not meet the requirements for him to seek her removal from office, according to the governor’s review of formal complaints filed against the clerk late last year. An error by Hadlock caused an initial ballot miscount in her county’s results. Eight local qualified electors submitted a complaint to the governor’s office in December, asking him to begin the process laid out in state statute for removing a county official from office. “Although I recognize that Clerk Hadlock made many serious mistakes in the 2024 Weston County elections, her actions do not rise to the level of misconduct or malfeasance, as I understand the meaning of those terms in this situation,” Gordon wrote in his</span><a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hadlock-Findings-and-Verified-Complaints.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was released last week. “I do not believe there is a clear path to proving guilt.”</span></p>

This policy recommends election offices use voting systems that have a paper record of every vote, such as paper ballots, which already applies to systems in more than 98% of jurisdictions. EAC Chairman Donald Palmer, Vice Chair Thomas Hicks, Commissioner Christy McCormick, and Commissioner Ben Hovland issued the following statement: “We recognize the importance of producing a paper trail for voting systems to enhance election verifiability, audit functions, and voter confidence. While most jurisdictions already use voting systems that produce a paper record of every vote, the EAC has adopted this policy to encourage the few remaining election offices to follow their lead. “States and localities select their own voting systems; however, auditable and software-independent voting systems are necessary to safeguard our nation’s elections. The agency’s newly adopted Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG 2.0) upholds this policy and requires the use of paper ballots in voting systems for certification. All voters, including those with disabilities, have the right to cast a ballot privately and independently. Accessibility remains a priority for the EAC, and this policy will not prevent voters with disabilities from exercising their right to cast a ballot. This action is part of the EAC’s congressional mandate to ensure elections are safe, secure, accurate, and accessible.” Nothing in the new policy is intended to contradict the accessibility provisions of Section 301 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 or any other accessibility provisions required by law.

							<h2>New Research and Resources</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8681" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BrennanCenter-150x128.png" alt="" width="150" height="128" />Vote By Mail:</strong> New research from The Brennan Center shows that a restrictive voting law in Texas </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/study-reveals-lasting-voter-suppression-effects-restrictive-texas-law"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made people less likely to vote for at least two years after having a mail ballot application or ballot rejected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As Brennan showed in 2022, the voters directly harmed by this law were more likely to be nonwhite, raising important questions about the long-term consequences of laws that fall more heavily on minority voters. The state enacted Senate Bill 1 in 2021, ostensibly to reduce widespread voter fraud — which in reality</span><a href="https://www.texasaft.org/government/elections/fact-check-no-there-is-not-rampant-voter-fraud-in-texas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not exist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The law made casting a ballot by mail more difficult, and it ended practices adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic to make voting easier, such as 24-hour and drive-thru voting. Brennan Center</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/records-show-massive-disenfranchisement-and-racial-disparities-2022-texas"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has already shown that thousands of mail ballot applications and mail ballots were rejected during the 2022 primary due to S.B. 1 and that nonwhite voters were disproportionately impacted. A</span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5264736"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new working paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Brennan Center along with Michael G. Miller and Ian Shapiro shows that voters whose applications and ballots were rejected in the primary were considerably less likely to vote in the 2022 general election and the 2024 primary. And those who did vote often shifted from mail to in-person voting. When voters use these less-preferred voting methods, this can impose time and travel costs on them. It can also make them less likely to vote in the future, as these policies and practices have increased the “cost” of casting a ballot for them. The new paper, which has been conditionally accepted for publication by the Journal of Politics, sheds new light on just how prolonged the negative effects of restrictive voting policies can be. Looking at the harmful impact in a single election misses how such policies can dampen turnout for years to come, even among relatively engaged voters like primary election participants. What’s more, focusing on turnout alone — and not the costs voters bear when they switch away from their preferred method of casting a ballot — understates the negative effects of such policies.</span></p>

Initially introduced by Wyden in 2017, the <a href="https://www.koin.com/news/politics/wyden-aims-to-bring-oregons-voting-model-nationwide-with-vote-at-home-act/">Vote at Home Act</a> would give eligible voters the option to vote by mail (including via drop-off site), provide pre-paid envelopes to return ballots and would automatically register citizens to vote at DMVs. Under the bill, voters who live in states with in-person, same-day voter registration would still have the option to vote at a polling station. The Vote at Home Act would also send ballots in the mail weeks ahead of Election Day, while providing funding for the United States Postal Service to cover costs associated with mailing ballots to and from voters. “Taking off work to vote in person – often waiting in long lines for hours – isn’t an option for so many voters. Voting is a fundamental constitutional right. It should be easy, and bringing the Oregon Way of vote-at-home nationwide will guarantee that every eligible voter can make their voices heard,” Wyden said in a press release.  Wyden is joined by several Democratic colleagues backing the bill, including Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass). “Voting by mail has worked in Oregon for years. It’s quick and secure—helping folks in red, blue, and purple states safely make their voices heard in our elections,” Sen. Jeff Merkley said. “This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. Expanding vote by mail nationwide is a secure way to ensure all eligible voters can exercise this constitutional right.”</span></p>

Mail-in voting, same-day voter registration, permanent absentee voting and early voting have all been struck down by Delaware courts in recent years. Only early voting and permanent absentee voting returned after the Delaware Supreme Court found the plaintiffs in that case lacked proper standing, but the merits of the case remain untouched. This prompted State Sen. Darius Brown (D-New Castle) to introduce a constitutional amendment addressing those two voting procedures — along with mail-in voting — last year, but with Republicans claiming support only for early voting and not permanent absentee or mail-in voting, the amendment failed. Brown is trying again this year, this time with two separate amendments: one for early voting and one for absentee voting. The two amendments have already cleared the State Senate. Constitutionalizing early voting received full bipartisan support, but the absentee voting amendment only received Republican support from State Sen. Eric Buckson (R-Dover). The two bills were heard in the House Administration Committee last week. The early voting amendment was released from committee unanimously, but the absentee voting amendment only received support from Democratic leadership. Both amendments will need support from at least one Republican to clear the House, and if passed, they will need to be reintroduced in 2026 and succeed again to be added to the constitution.</span></p>

Jay DeBoyer, a Clay Township Republican who leads the House Oversight Committee. &#8220;When a subpoena is issued, they must provide documents, they must provide testimony. That has been stonewalled for seven months. We&#8217;ve been extremely patient.&#8221; The resolution holding Benson in contempt passed along party lines, 58-47.

We have turned over more than 3,300 pages of election documents to this committee and to the public on our department’s website. So, if … House Republicans want to go to court over this, we will see them in court.”</span></p>

Joe Lombardo (R) vetoed a proposal aimed at </span><a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/politics/nevada-legislature/nevada-governor-vetoes-bill-to-expand-mail-drop-boxes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanding ballot dropboxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The proposal, Assembly Bill 306, would have required Clark County to establish 10 drop boxes be available between the end of early voting and the day before Election Day. The bill included smaller numbers for other counties. The proposal passed the Nevada Senate along party lines and in the Nevada Assembly with one Republican joining Democrats. “Nevada is already among the easiest states in the nation to cast a vote,” Lombardo wrote in his veto message Thursday. “AB 306 appears to be well-intentioned but falls short of its stated goals while failing to guarantee appropriate oversight of the proposed ballot boxes or the ballots cast. I believe additional election reforms should be considered as part of a larger effort to improve election security, integrity and allow Nevada to declare winners more quickly.” Nevada state law requires all mail-in ballots to be mailed and postmarked by Election Day. There is then a four-day period after Election Day when county clerks can accept the postmarked ballots and process them. If the ballot does not have a postmark, county clerks can process ballots up to three days after Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan bill aimed at </span><a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/nevada-senate-unanimously-approves-bipartisan-bill-to-improve-mail-ballot-process"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enhancing the mail ballot process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sponsored by Republican Minority Leader Greg Hafen, the legislation, known as AB148, mandates that sample ballots be distributed to registered voters before the actual mail ballots are sent out. The bill specifies that mail ballots must be sent within a designated one-week timeframe. Additionally, it requires county or city clerks to ensure that sample ballots reach voters before the deadline for distributing mail ballots. The bill now returns to the state assembly for approval of an amendment before it can be sent to Governor Joe Lombardo for consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonpartisan voters could soon be allowed to vote for major party candidates in state and presidential primaries under a bill introduced by a top state lawmaker this week. In what is likely the most consequential election proposal so far this legislative session, Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) introduced</span><a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/83rd2025/Bill/12961/Overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AB597</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would </span><a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nevada-nonpartisans-could-vote-in-party-primaries-under-bill-brought-by-top-lawmaker"><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly expand the voting options of nonpartisans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who make up the largest voting bloc in Nevada but are left out of participating in Republican and Democratic primaries. The bill comes with one week left of the session, a time when last-minute introductions by major lawmakers are typically the sign of a deal that has been struck between legislative power players. Asked by The Nevada Independent why the proposal was only just introduced, Yeager said “we had some things to get done first.” “It’s just time to make sure that nonpartisans and non-affiliated voters can vote in partisan elections,” Yeager said. “It’s something I’ve been thinking about for a while.”</span></p>

This would prohibit school districts from acknowledging their levies while early voting occurs. Voter education is an important step in passing school levies, and advocates are worried about a new House bill that would limit communication ahead of elections. &#8220;They have 11 other months of the year to provide information to their citizens,&#8221; state Rep. Adam Mathews (R-Lebanon) said. Mathews and state Rep. Tex Fischer (R-Boardman) introduced H.B. 264, which would prohibit government entities from referring to — even without saying how to vote — on a levy, bond issue or candidate during early voting, the 30 days before an election. &#8220;Making sure that their taxpayer dollars are used for the governing of their entities rather than influencing elections,&#8221; Mathews continued. Current law already bans public jurisdictions from taking partisan stances on issues. This would extend that provision to now prohibit the agency from providing information, explanation or viewing.

The certified title “prohibits vote-by-mail elections,” requires “proof of citizenship” for voter registration, and mandates “valid” photo identification to vote. The title is now subject to challenge by anyone who objects to the title’s wording between now and June 2. For measures that are likely to be contested, such as IP 37, that appeal process can be a game of political football as interested parties seek the wording they think will resonate most with voters. “I’m happy with the ballot title,” Ben Edtl, one of three chief petitioners hoping to end vote by mail, told Willamette Week. “It’s important to note that our proposed constitutional amendment allows for verified absentee ballots to continue to vote by mail, including military, people with disabilities, and elderly who may not be able to cast their votes in person.”</span></p>

The bill passed the Senate last month along party lines and with little debate. Republicans and allied groups around the country have been aggressively pushing for such citizenship proof measures at the state and federal level. SB 16 and its companion, House Bill 5337, were among the most sweeping proof-of-citizenship proposals introduced anywhere in the country, applying not only to new applicants for voter registration but also retroactively to 18.6 million voters already registered in the state. Under the bill, voters who failed to provide proof of citizenship would have been allowed to cast ballots only in congressional races — and would have been barred from voting by mail. According to Votebeat, Gov. Greg Abbott could still call a special session on the issue, and Republicans are moving forward with a plan to ask voters to approve a constitutional amendment affirming that only U.S. citizens are permitted to vote in Texas — something already established under Texas law. On May 26, Abbott signed a bill to add the measure to the ballot in the November constitutional amendment election. The proposed amendment does not include the enforcement and maintenance provisions to check for citizenship that were included in SB 16.</span></p>

The WEC decision means municipalities still must make at least one electronic voting machine available at polling places for voters with disabilities. In a 5-1 decision, commissioners dismissed a complaint alleging the Rusk County town of Thornapple broke state law when it switched from voting tabulators to hand-counted paper ballots for April and August elections in 2024. The town’s decision spurred two complaints with the elections commission and a federal lawsuit from the U.S Department of Justice, which is currently being appealed. During a meeting this week, commission staff said they found no probable cause to believe Thornapple broke state law by discontinuing the use of electronic voting machines.</span></p>

Kim said she would be entering a plea of not guilty at her arraignment but declined to comment further under advice from her lawyer. In a news release, prosecutors allege Kim perjured herself repeatedly by claiming she lived at multiple addresses in the city’s fifth district while she was actually living elsewhere in the city.  Under Irvine’s city council districts, it’s illegal for a candidate to run for office in a district they don’t  live in. City voters are also only able to cast their ballot for a city council member in the district they reside in.</span></p>

One of the most-controversial parts of the law, passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature on May 2 and immediately signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, shortens from 30 to 10 days the length of time to submit signed petitions to supervisors of elections. In addition, the law (HB 1205) includes hefty fines for petitions that are filed late and makes it a felony for petition gatherers to retain voters’ personal information on petitions or make changes to completed petitions. Groups accused of “substantial irregularities” in the petition process could face racketeering charges. Ballot initiative groups asked Walker for a preliminary injunction to block parts of the law, including the 10-day deadline. Lawyers for the groups argue in part, that the provisions unconstitutionally “chill” political speech. The shortened time frame to submit petitions combined with the risk of fines for late submissions have erected an “insurmountable barrier” for placement of initiatives on the 2026 ballot, Nicholas Steiner, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center who represents Florida Decides Healthcare, told Walker. “It’s making it impossible, really, for FDH (Florida Decides Healthcare) to engage with the target audience,” he said. The 10-day turnaround “has zero relation to fighting fraud or preserving ballot integrity,” Glenn Burhans, an attorney for Smart &amp; Safe Florida, argued. The purpose of the quick turnaround “is to squash the initiative process, pure and simple. It’s stamping on speech,” Burhans said.</span></p>

According to a release, South Georgia Circuit District Attorney Joseph K. Mulholland requested the GBI investigate allegations of election interference for the City of Camilla’s municipal election held on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. Camilla Mayor Kelvin Owens, Cheryl Ford and Rhunette Williford have collectively been indicted on six counts of “interference with elections,” four counts of conspiracy to commit election fraud and three counts of failure of public or political officer to perform duty. This comes after the GBI began an investigation into Mayor Kelvin Owens locking the doors on Election Day — November 5, 2024 — causing voting to start in the afternoon. This comes after a grand jury found that Owens, Ford and Williford conspired to quote, “prevent elections from occurring on November 5, 2024, contrary to the laws of said State, the good order, peace and dignity thereof.” The indictment went on to say that Cherly Ford’s decision to resign the day before was to stop voters from voting.</span></p>

In Maryland, Democratic and Republican primary elections are “partially closed.” The state’s nearly 1 million unaffiliated, Green Party and Libertarian voters may only participate in major party primary elections with permission from the respective party, even though they help fund them, according to state law. This includes the recent March 4 special primary election in Prince George’s County, estimated by election officials to cost county taxpayers $2 million. The lawsuit seeks to stop the state from funding closed primary elections. The lawsuit claims that election officials are violating Article 1, Section 1 of the state constitution, which guarantees that every qualified U.S. citizen who is a resident of Maryland “shall be entitled to vote in the ward or election district in which the citizen resides at all elections to be held in this State.” The plaintiffs, also backed by the Open Primaries Education Fund, claim the state is additionally violating Articles 7 and 24 of Maryland’s Declaration of Rights, under the Free Elections Clause and the Equal Protection Clause. The lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County on May 27. The plaintiffs are registered voters residing in Baltimore City, Anne Arundel, Prince George’s and St. Mary’s counties.</span></p>

Millerallegedly attempted to vote for her dead mother before the November election. Miller was charged in October with two counts of intentionally making or signing a false certificate and one count of casting an illegal vote. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a $10,000 fine or both. The Itasca County Auditor’s Office flagged the ballots for fraud based on the signatures. According to the criminal complaint, Miller told an Itasca County sheriff&#8217;s lieutenant she filled out her mother’s ballot, signed her mother’s name on the envelope and signed her mother’s name as a witness on her own ballot. Miller allegedly said her mother was &#8220;an avid Donald Trump supporter&#8221; and wanted to vote for him, but died before their ballots came. According to the Minnesota Vital Statistics Death Report of Itasca County, Miller&#8217;s mother died Aug. 31. Miller’s next appearance is in August.</span></p>

The Republican majority on the court declined or dismissed requests that Gov. Josh Stein made three weeks ago to block for now the enforcement of the law approved last year by the GOP-controlled General Assembly shifting authority to Republican State Auditor Dave Boliek. In late April, some trial judges hearing Stein’s lawsuit</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-governor-legislature-elections-board-auditor-44db0cb156c701577b9cb2d22b1d135f"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> de</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">clared the law unconstitutional and said the law couldn’t be carried out. But on April 30 — the day before the board’s five appointments made by Boliek would otherwise begin their terms — a panel on the intermediate-level state Court of Appeals ruled the law could still be carried out while broader legal questions surrounding the power shift are reviewed on appeal. Stein’s attorneys later that day asked the Supreme Court to intervene and keep blocking the law. But the justices didn’t weigh in publicly until now, effectively handing a legal victory to GOP legislative leaders who for years had wanted to wrest board control from Democratic governors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Justice </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/usa-ncsbe-voter-roll-maintenance.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the North Carolina State Board of Elections this week, claiming the board </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/feds-sue-north-carolina-over-voter-registration-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violated federal voting law in its handling of voter registration records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the 2024 elections.  The state’s election board violated the Help America Vote Act, the Department of Justice said, by using a voter registration form that did not require voters to provide their driver’s license number or last four digits of a Social Security number. This information is required to confirm the voting eligibility of U.S. citizens under federal voting laws. Registrants were then added to the state’s voter registration roll, the DOJ said, without their identifying information being confirmed. The form that the state used, the government said, did not make it clear to registrants that they were required to provide identifying information: required fields had red text, but the boxes for a driver&#8217;s license number or the last four of a Social Security number were printed in black. The board also didn’t contact voters who registered using this form to update their information in advance of the 2024 election. The government asked the court to require the elections board to develop a plan to contact and update the information of all registered voters who are missing information in the state’s voter rolls. It also requested that the government then be provided a complete list of corrected records. The state board of elections is still reviewing the complaint, said Sam Hayes, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections.</span></p>

The Appeals Court ruled earlier this month that voters cannot file a Voting Rights Act lawsuit based on allegations of racial discrimination. “Two weeks ago, two Eighth Circuit judges ruled that the Voting Rights Act does not create voting rights enforceable by voters in court,” said Mark Gaber, senior director of the Campaign Legal Center. “The full Eighth Circuit should overturn that radical and unlawful ruling, which flouts Supreme Court precedent and congressional intent.” The Campaign Legal Center represented the tribes and voters in the case. The ruling overturned a North Dakota federal judge’s verdict in November 2023 that the North Dakota Legislature diluted the Native American vote when it redistricted its legislative voting map in 2021. Lawmakers put the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and the counties of Rolette, Towner and most of Cavalier into District 9. It also drew the Spirit Lake Nation into District 15 with Ramsey County. “We went to court because the map the state passed made it harder for Native voters like me to have a real voice,” said Wes Davis, a Turtle Mountain voter who joined the case. “The court agreed and gave us a fair chance to elect candidates. Now, the Eighth Circuit wants to take away my right to question maps that silence votes, not because we were wrong, but because they say the Voting Rights Act does not create rights.” If the Appeals Court decision stands, only the U.S. Department of Justice can file a Voting Rights Act lawsuit in the Eighth Circuit.</span></p>

Chapman was charged with illegal voting for casting two ballots in the 2020 General Election–one in person in Wayne County, West Virginia, and the other as an absentee-by-mail ballot in Florida. Prosecuting Attorney Richard Thompson obtained the indictment, and matter was adjudicated by Wayne County Circuit Court Judge James H. Young, Jr. According to the Court’s Order, sufficient evidence exists to find Mr. Chapman guilty of the offense of illegal voting and the Defendant pled “No Contest” to the misdemeanor charge. Chapman was ordered to pay a $250 fine plus court costs. At the time the election fraud was committed the penalty was a misdemeanor. However, during the 2022 Regular Legislative Session, the West Virginia Legislature passed HB 4311 making illegal voting a felony crime punishable by 1-10 years of imprisonment and up to a $10,000 fine.</span></p>
