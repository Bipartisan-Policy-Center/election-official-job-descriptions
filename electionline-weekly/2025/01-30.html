							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>What if everyone could verify election results themselves?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Jocelyn Bucaro, Free Democracy Foundation with contributions by Casandra Hockenberry, The Council of State Governments and Jared Marcotte, The Turnout</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the 2024 election was incredibly smooth. Election administrators once again proved their professionalism and integrity, ensuring every eligible voter was able to vote and assuring transparent and accurate election results. The margin of victory in most contests was wide enough that voters and candidates generally accepted the integrity of the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, despite the successes of 2024, we continue to see vulnerabilities in our election systems that test the public&#8217;s trust in election results. It&#8217;s becoming too common for losing candidates and organizations to question results and the integrity of the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A solution is available that could help increase transparency and confidence in election results: independently verified elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>What are independently verified elections?</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Independently verified elections use software with which voters can verify independently that their votes are recorded, cast, and counted correctly. Voting systems that are independently verifiable use advanced cryptography to provide evidence to voters that their ballots are correctly cast and included in the election tally. Such systems also increase public transparency by giving the public evidence that all eligible ballots are tallied correctly. This gives the public another opportunity to engage with election processes and continue to build trust in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Independently verified elections are not new. The techniques have been used in</span><a href="https://www.valimised.ee/en/internet-voting-estonia"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elections around the world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for twenty years. Here in the U.S., independently verified election systems have been piloted since 2020, including in elections in Wisconsin,</span><a href="https://www.electionguard.vote/images/EAC%20Report%20Final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Idaho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://civicdesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CCD-ElectionGuard-in-CollegePark-2023-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maryland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Utah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How do independently verified elections work?</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pilots in the U.S. have used</span><a href="https://www.electionguard.vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ElectionGuard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology to produce independently verifiable election results. ElectionGuard is open-source software that runs alongside in-person voting systems to create a second, encrypted copy of every vote that can be used to check the results of the election without revealing how anyone voted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For voters, independent verification with software like ElectionGuard is largely invisible and non-disruptive to existing processes. Voters at polling places mark their ballots in the same way they would without ElectionGuard, generally either with a ballot marking device or by hand. As each voter casts their ballot into a scanner, ElectionGuard encrypts their ballot and produces a confirmation code that voters can use to verify their ballot is included in the final count.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters also have the option to verify that their votes are encrypted correctly by completing a check at the time of casting. Through this process, voters can confirm that their intended votes have been correctly recorded and encrypted. Because this requires the system to decrypt their previously encrypted votes, it has the effect of spoiling their ballot and those checked ballots are not included in the final tally. After a check, the voter is given a new ballot to mark and cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For election administrators, implementing tools like ElectionGuard to produce independently verified elections requires some additional preparation and voter education, but trials have demonstrated that voters appreciate the added transparency and confirmation that the system is working correctly.</span><a href="https://civicdesign.org/reports/electionguard-in-college-park-maryland/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Center for Civic Design’s report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a pilot in College Park, MD highlights the success of independently verifiable elections, voter ease and increased trust in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More pilots are needed to continue to improve the efficacy of tools like ElectionGuard. The good news is that the latest</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/voluntary-voting-system-guidelines"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Voluntary Voting System Guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include updated requirements for independently verifiable election systems. While ElectionGuard is the first software tool to produce independently verifiable elections for U.S. voting systems, other systems are under development, including a tool to produce</span><a href="https://www.freedemocracyfoundation.org/votehub"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> independently verifiable online voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transparency and auditability are critical in election systems, and with an increasingly skeptical public, they are essential to preserving confidence in the integrity of our elections. Independently verified elections hold promise to enhance auditability and improve voter confidence.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Election Technology Initiative is a partnership between</span><a href="https://www.csg.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Council of State Governments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://turnout.rocks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Turnout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dedicated to maintaining and supporting open-source technologies that ease administrative and financial burdens on election offices, increase access for all voters regardless of location, disability or language, while also improving voter confidence in election results.</span></em></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7086" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/USDOJ-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />News From the Department of Justice</strong>: Last week, The Associated Press reported that new Justice Department leadership has</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/civil-rights-division-justice-department-trump-2dcb45cca7c9c9cdaea78282d4279c35"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> put a freeze on civil rights litigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Attorneys in the department’s Civil Rights Division were ordered not to file any new complaints, amicus briefs or other certain court papers “until further notice,” one of the memos said. The memos, sent by new chief of staff Chad Mizelle, is a sign of major changes expected in the Civil Rights Division. The pick to lead the division is Harmeet Dhillon, a well-known conservative attorney. According to the AP, it’s unclear how long the “litigation freeze” may last. The memo said the move was necessary to ensure “that the federal government speaks with one voice in its view of the law and to ensure that the President’s appointees or designees have the opportunity to decide whether to initiate new cases.” Also from The Associated Press, is a story about how the Justice Department appears poised to take a v</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/pam-bondi-justice-department-elections-voting-fraud-2020-28ffe85f81e7edf95064e5192c3efce1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ery different approach to investigating voting and elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Conservative calls to overhaul the department by removing career employees, increasing federal voter fraud cases and investigating the 2020 election are raising concerns among voting rights groups about the future of the agency under Pam Bondi. Bondi supported legal efforts to overturn the 2020 Pennsylvania election results, has reiterated false claims about the 2020 election and during her Senate confirmation hearing refused to directly state that former President Joe Biden won, saying only that she accepted the results. She pledged to remain independent. “Nobody should be prosecuted for political purposes,” Bondi told senators. Voting and legal experts have said the authors behind Project 2025 have a misunderstanding of the law and how the department operates. Adopting the report’s approach, experts said, would likely result in a decrease in enforcement of federal civil rights and voting laws and could drive career department employees to leave. Already this week, DOJ sought to pull out of an </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/2025/01/29/us-justice-department-dismiss-voting-rights-case-virginia-voter-roll-cleanup/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ongoing voting rights case against Virginia </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">over the state’s removal of names from voter rolls shortly before the November election. The department’s</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25507222-doj-dismissal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> motion for dismissal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, doesn’t end the case though because there are also private plaintiffs, including voting rights groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Branching Out</strong>: At least two California counties are in the process of separating elections duties into its own, stand alone office. In </span><a href="https://bakersfieldnow.com/news/local/kern-county-considers-restructuring-election-responsibilities-amid-criticism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kern County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the board of supervisors recently vote to remove  election duties from the county&#8217;s Auditor-Controller-County Clerk office once the current auditor-controller-county clerk-registrar’s term is complete in 2027.. Supervisor Jeff Flores of District 3 said, &#8220;We have to improve, change the structure, and make it a standalone agency with a singular focus which is improving elections in Kern County.&#8221; Flores explained that the county&#8217;s expansion and changes to election law in Sacramento are driving the proposal to create a new registrar of voters position, separate from the office’s current duties. Concerns remain about the registrar of voters becoming an unelected position, with the Board of Supervisors potentially handpicking the next registrar if the reform passes in Sacramento. Flores assured, &#8220;We have got safeguards for that in going through the civil service process. We want to hire the best person with the talent with the requisite expertise that knows how to do elections and do them well.&#8221; Back in 2001, </span><a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/sonoma-county-registrar-of-voters-elections-deva-proto-board-of-supervi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonoma County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> merged the registrar of voters office with the clerk-recorder-assessor’s office and this week, the board of supervisors voted to separate out the elections office. The change was recommended by Clerk-Recorder-Assessor-Registrar of Voters Deva Proto with support from County Executive Christina Rivera. Proto called the move “the best course of action to ensure continuity and efficiency within the Registrar of Voters going into the future.” According to the Press Democrat, the move comes largely in response to increasing demand on the office driven by myriad state legislative changes and a national political climate that has intensified the spotlight on election proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5378" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WV-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />The Kids Are Alright</strong>: New </span><a href="https://wvpublic.org/secretary-of-state-recognizes-student-voter-registration-efforts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">West Virginia </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of State Kris Warner recognized two high school seniors for their efforts in registering their classmates to vote.  Emily Carothers and Kierston Rozell of Meadow Bridge High School in Fayette County were named “Honorary Secretaries of State” as part of the Jennings Randolph Award for Civic Engagement. “They get the opportunity to come to Charleston during the legislative session and spend a half a day doing everything that I’m doing as Secretary of State,” Warner said.  The award is given to any public or private high school in West Virginia that registers at least 85% of their eligible seniors to vote. Warner highlighted civics teacher Cory Woodrum, principal Stacy White and Fayette County Clerk Michelle Holly for their role in recognizing Carothers and Rozell for their work. He encouraged any other school that has met the registration threshold to nominate students for recognition. “For the last eight years in West Virginia, we’ve registered 112,000 high school seniors,” Warner said. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-5402" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NM-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />“That means that one in every 10 voters in West Virginia over the last eight years has been registered as a high school senior. We’re proud of that, and we’re looking to increase the number of those participating in elections by continuing to recognize schools just like Meadow Bridge.” Earlier this month at a ceremony in Santa Fe, </span><a href="https://www.sos.nm.gov/2025/01/23/secretary-toulouse-oliver-awards-two-new-mexicans-the-john-lewis-youth-leadership-award/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mexico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver presented the 2024 John Lewis Youth Leadership Award to two exceptional New Mexico youth leaders. The 2024 recipients of the John Lewis Youth Leadership Award are Lila Quezada and Thanh Nguyen. &#8220;I am thrilled to congratulate Lila Quezada and Thanh Nguyen for their extraordinary commitment to making a difference in their communities,” said Toulouse Oliver. “Their leadership, vision, and dedication to advancing equality and civic engagement embody the values of the late Congressman John Lewis, who was and is a deep personal inspiration to me. These young leaders are not just shaping the future—they are inspiring us all to create a more just and inclusive world today.&#8221; Quezada was nominated by Girls Inc. of Santa Fe and Nguyen was nominated by the New Mexico Asian Family Center (NMAFC). Quezada and Nguyen will be recognized a week from today, along with other state recipients of the 2024 John Lewis Youth Leadership Award, during an awards ceremony at the 2025 NASS Winter Conference in Washington, D.C.</span></p>

Gov. Laura Kelly and other state officials unveiled the “Rebel Women” painting that spans an entire wall on the first floor this week, the anniversary of Kansas’ admission as the 34th U.S. state in 1861. According to the Associated Press, while Kansas Day is traditionally marked with renditions of the official state song, “Home on the Range,” event also featured the women’s voting rights anthem, “Suffrage Song,” to the tune of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.” A 2022 law authorized the mural, and artist Phyllis Garibay-Coon, of Manhattan, in northeastern Kansas, won the contest with a depiction of 13 prominent Kansas suffragists. A few women in the crowd of several hundred people were dressed as 19th century campaigners who were active before statehood. Women could vote in school elections in 1861 and in city elections in 1887, and the nation’s first woman mayor, Susanna M. Salter, was elected in Argonia, Kansas, that year. Voters amended the state constitution in 1912 to grant women full voting rights.</span></p>

Establishing a national right to vote by mail would only strengthen our democracy by allowing more Americans to make their voices heard.” The Universal Right to Vote by Mail Act would amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 by creating an option for no-excuse absentee voting in all 50 states and U.S. territories. Additionally, the legislation would require states to provide voters the opportunity to cure their ballots. The bill has several co-sponsors including Reps. Debbie Dingell (MI-06), Hank Johnson (GA-04), and Rashida Tlaib (MI-12), and is endorsed by the National Disability Rights Network, the League of Women Voters of the United States, the National Vote at Home Institute and Common Cause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5170" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/AlaskaCapitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Alaska:</strong> Gov. Mike Dunleavy introduced a bill through the House. </span><a href="https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/34?Root=HB%20%2063"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 63</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/01/23/election-reforms-are-on-the-agenda-for-alaska-lawmakers-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposes new rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for, among others, voter registration, voting by mail, voting and counting timelines. The bill also would put new limits on voting time. All ballots would have to be received by the state Division of Elections by Election Day, under the new legislation, when currently they just have to be postmarked and mailed by that day. It would shorten early voting time, which opens 15 days prior to and ends on Election Day. Under the bill, it would close five days before Election Day.   The bill would eliminate the automatic voter registration process when applying for the Permanent Fund Dividend. That provision was enacted in 2016, when Alaskans passed a ballot measure to allow voter registration during the application process.  For vote by mail, it would provide postage for all absentee ballots being mailed in. It would allow ballot counting by the Division of Elections to begin sooner, up to 10 days before the election. It would also create an option for communities with less than 750 people to opt for all by-mail voting for their elections.  The legislation is in response to a range of issues and complaints around Alaska’s elections last year, including concerns around delays in ballot counting and transparency, election security, and problems with staffing, absentee ballots, and long lines at some polling places. The bill was introduced in the House and referred to the state affairs and finance committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Senate side, the new majority, made up of a coalition of Democratic and Republican senators, is set to put forth an election reform bill </span><a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/01/23/election-reforms-are-on-the-agenda-for-alaska-lawmakers-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">focused on a range of issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including streamlining the voting process and expanding access for voters. For mail-in ballots, the bill would also pay for postage for all ballots, and eliminate the witness signature requirement for absentee ballots, which Wielechowski said isn’t verified and has disqualified ballots unnecessarily. The bill would establish a ballot tracking barcodes for absentee ballots, and a system for review. If there’s a mistake on a ballot, the bill would create an easier process for corrections. To address long lines at polling places, as seen in hours-long lines to vote in Anchorage last year, the bill would require ballot drop boxes be available at each regional office, if feasible, and one per every 20,000 residents.</span></p>

The legislation will </span><a href="https://azmirror.com/2025/01/23/elections-committee-gives-another-go-at-banning-vote-centers-putting-a-1000-voter-cap-on-precincts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assign every voter a neighborhood polling location</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that could accommodate no more than 1,000 voters — and throw out the ballots of voters who go to the wrong polling place. Most Arizona counties, including Pima and Maricopa, use a vote center model. Yuma and Yavapai counties have both used vote centers for more than a decade. Arizona Association of Counties Executive Director Jen Marson, who lobbies for county election officials, warned that requirement comes with logistical challenges. “The fact that we don’t have enough places is what moved counties to the vote center model to begin with. We would have to significantly ramp up not only the places but also the people. You have to staff all of those voting locations with a certain number of poll workers to be in those locations, and we have trouble getting bodies too,” Marson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4166" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />California:</strong> Lawmakers have introduced a bill to implement </span><a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/california-news/california-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-require-voter-id-in-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voter identification requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in response to President Donald Trump’s demand for the state to reform how it holds elections to unlock wildfire aid. State Assemblymembers Carl DeMaio (R-San Diego) and Bill Essayli (R-Corona) introduced the measure, describing it in a statement Monday as an enhancement to bolster trust and security in the state’s elections. Specifically, the legislation,</span><a href="https://ad75.asmrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RN2503301_distprint-copy.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Assembly Bill 25</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would roll back a different law passed last year prohibiting local governments in California from compelling production of an ID to vote, making signature certification the blanket process in the state to confirm a voter’s citizenship. Instead, AB 25 would require voters to show a government-issued ID when heading to the polls or sending in a mail-in ballot, and mandate citizenship verification before a resident is added to the state’s voter rolls. The bill would also require all counties to count mail-in ballots within 72 hours following an election or risk forfeiting its ability to automatically distribute them during the next election it administers. Voters would still be able to request absentee ballots. On top of that, AB 25 would empower the state auditor to conduct random analyses of voter lists maintained by county election officials and their signature verification processes.</span></p>

Ron DeSantis, which critics warned could</span><a href="https://www.staugustine.com/story/news/local/state/2025/01/27/desantis-bid-to-overhaul-ballot-initiatives-snubbed-by-gop-legislative-leaders/77972509007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effectively eliminate citizen-backed ballot proposals </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Florida, was shelved by the Legislature’s Republican leaders who defied the governor in this week’s special session. DeSantis wanted lawmakers to outlaw third-party signature-gathering for ballot initiatives, a tactic virtually all campaigns rely on when seeking to collect the almost 900,000 signatures from voters needed to qualify. House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami, told House members Monday that any changes to such initiatives can wait until the regular two-month legislative session begins in March. He also cautioned that it was important to proceed cautiously with revamping a system that gives voters a voice. Ballot measures have yielded voter-approved medical marijuana, minimum wage and felons voting rights in recent years. He added, “I believe ballot issues need reform. But I do not believe that we as elected officials should slip into a special session and try to ram through changes that affect the rights of the very voters who sent us here to Tallahassee.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5969" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IDCap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Idaho</strong>: Lawmakers introduced a bill that would </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/01/29/bill-would-give-idaho-governor-veto-power-over-voter-approved-ballot-initiatives/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">let the governor veto laws passed directly by voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The bill by Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, would let the governor veto successful ballot initiatives — similar to how the governor can veto laws passed by the Idaho House and Senate. If an initiative passes with at least two-thirds support from voters, the bill says “the initiative petition shall be approved without the need for the governor’s approval.” Skaug said that’s similar to the legislative process, which lets two-thirds of state lawmakers override gubernatorial vetoes. If voters pass a ballot initiative with less than two-thirds support, the bill would give the governor five days to approve or veto the initiative.  If the governor vetoes the initiative, the bill says the Idaho Secretary of State “shall then cause the initiative petition to be once again submitted to the voters at the next general election.” The House State Affairs Committee on Wednesday introduced the bill on a unanimous voice vote. If passed into law, the bill would take effect immediately through an emergency clause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5802" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IN-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Indiana:</strong> Students at Indiana public colleges and universities would no longer be able use their </span><a href="https://www.wbaa.org/local-news/2025-01-27/student-ids-banned-as-voter-identification-under-bill-headed-for-indiana-senate-floor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school IDs as proof of identification </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">when they go to vote. That’s under a bill approved this week by a Senate committee. Sen. Blake Doriot (R-Goshen), the author of</span><a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2025/bills/senate/10/details"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB 10</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said he’s worried school IDs don’t have the same “rigor” as other forms of identification. “Go to the BMV, we get an identification card or we get a driver’s license,” Doriot said. Student IDs can’t be used to register to vote, only to show proof of ID at polling places. And only under certain circumstances — it has to be issued by public universities and colleges, include a photo and come with an expiration date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indiana mayors, city and town clerks and councilors would be elected in presidential election years under a bill, </span><a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2025/bills/senate/355/details"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 355</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, approved by a Senate committee this week. </span><a href="https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/indiana-municipal-elections-moved-to-presidential-election-years-under-senate-bill.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections for municipalities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of at least 3,500 people currently take place in the odd-numbered years before presidential elections. Kegan Prentice, Indiana secretary of state legislative director, said presidential election years have higher turnout than off-year elections. And he said there would be significant cost savings. Monroe County Clerk Nicole Browne, representing the Indiana Clerks Association, said consolidating elections would be a logistical help. “This would also be a benefit for clerks who already struggle to recruit and retain quality poll workers,” Browne said. “We simply do not have those people wanting to turn out in municipal elections in the same way that we do if it’s a presidential year.”</span></p>

The legislation,</span><a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HSB37"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Study Bill 37</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would require a person’s citizenship status to be listed on the back of their driver’s license or non-operator identification card. People applying for renewal or the issuing of new IDs would be required to provide the Iowa Department of Transportation with their status as a U.S. citizen or noncitizen. Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, said she did not believe the driver’s license proposal was the best way to address concerns about noncitizens participating in Iowa elections because of the potential for discrimination when putting citizenship status on an ID like a driver’s license. Rep. Skyler Wheeler, R-Hull, said the bill’s focus was on ensuring that only U.S. citizens are participating in elections. “We have every right as a state to ensure that only citizens are voting in our elections,” he said. “And we think at this time this might be the right path, we’ll have discussions and see if there’s a different path.” Wheeler told reporters that there areas to “flesh out” in the bill, such as what information would be listed on IDs, if citizenship status would have to be listed on other photo IDs accepted for voter registration and whether driver’s licenses would be required to be updated after a change in citizenship status. The subcommittee advanced the legislation 2-1, with James voting against.</span></p>

Laura Kelly vetoed in 2023, and introduced last year. The Legislature adopted the three-day grace period for ballots postmarked by Election Day in a near-unanimous vote in 2017 after then-Secretary of State Kris Kobach asked the Legislature to pass the law in response to slow U.S. Postal Service delivery. Clay Barker, general council for the Secretary of State’s Office, said Kansas has one of the shorter grace periods. Deadlines for mail-in ballots in other states range from 5 p.m. on Election Day to 14 days after. Barker said that in the states with shorter or no grace periods, ballots are often sent out farther in advance. Kansas sends out mail-in ballots 20 days before an election, meaning recipients would have a shorter turnaround time. SB 4 does not require mail-in ballots to be sent earlier.  The Senate Federal and State Affairs Committee approved the bill — sending it to the full Senate for consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a hearing this week, legislators weighed</span><a href="https://www.kslegislature.gov/li/b2025_26/measures/sb6/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would prohibit giving voters the </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2025/01/28/out-of-state-advocates-support-kansas-ranked-choice-voting-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">option to rank candidates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by order of preference. Ranked-choice voting was last used in Kansas during the 2020 party-run Democratic presidential primary, but it has never been used in an official election run by state or county election officers. Current state law does not provide guidance for ranked-choice voting methods, said Jason Long with the Kansas Office of the Revisor of Statutes. The bill, which was the subject of a hearing Monday, would establish a definition for ranked-choice voting and cement a ban on the practice at all levels of government.  The bill defines ranked-choice voting as “a form of voting that allows voters to rank two or more candidates for an elected office in order of preference and tabulates the cast ballots in multiple rounds with the elimination of the lowest vote-receiving candidate after each round until a candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6763" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/MICap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Michigan</strong>: A new proposal from a top Michigan House Republican seeks to require would-be voters to </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/michigan/2025/01/29/proof-of-citizenship-proposal-bryan-posthumus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">provide proof that they are U.S. citizens when they register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The House joint resolution from Rep. Bryan Posthumus, a Republican from Rockford and the House majority floor leader, would require anyone who registers to vote starting on Dec. 18, 2026, to verify that they are U.S. citizens. Voters who register without that documentation may present those documents later to their community election officials or the secretary of state’s office. Those who have not confirmed their citizenship in time for the election would be required to cast a provisional ballot, which would only be counted if their citizenship is verified within six days after an election. But the bill would go beyond just newly registering voters. It would require the state to “use an ongoing systematic process” to continually affirm that the people in the qualified voter file — the state’s record of everyone registered to vote — are U.S. citizens. That means retroactive verification for the more than 8 million people on Michigan’s rolls. Those who are identified as noncitizens would be notified within a week and then have 60 days to verify their citizenship or be removed from the rolls. Citizenship can be verified with a state ID or the last four digits of a person’s Social Security number, according to the text of the joint amendment, which more than 40 other Republicans signed on to. The state must then “use all reasonable efforts” to verify citizenship, which can include checking with the federal government. According to Votebeat, the proposal to amend the state constitution isn’t likely to pass the Legislature with required two-thirds support, but conservatives are already gearing up for a petition drive to try to put the proposal before voters on the 2026 ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4031" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NH-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />New Hampshire</strong>: Sen. Kevin Avard introduced a bill to </span><a href="https://www.ledgertranscript.com/Kevin-Avard-introduces-NH-Senate-bill-to-compel-ballot-counts-by-hand-in-NH-elections-59048066"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make it easier to request a hand count</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of election ballots. Senate Bill 44 would compel local cities and towns to tabulate election results by hand if 100 voters in a specific election request it. There’s no determined vote threshold, so even if the election was decided by a large margin, if 100 people request a recount, the city or town would have to comply. All recounts would have to be finished within 15 days of the election.  “I’m sure machines are accurate, but I think everybody just wants to make sure they feel like part of the process,” Avard said at his bill’s hearing. “I think if people want that ability to just double-check, it’s not a bad idea.” Secretary of State David Scanlan opposed the bill, saying that municipalities already have the authority to decide whether they want to use ballot-counting machines or hand-count their election results. He called the bill “problematic” in that it gives authority to cities and towns to conduct their own recounts. New Hampshire’s current law says only the Secretary of State can perform recounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5272" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ND-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />North Dakota</strong>: North Dakota hasn’t had voter registration since 1951. Some lawmakers are sponsoring a bill to bring it back. House Bill 1287 would </span><a href="https://www.kfyrtv.com/2025/01/23/house-bill-looks-bring-voter-registration-north-dakota/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require all voters to register </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">either ahead of an election or on the day of an election. They could register by mailing a form to the county auditor at least 30 days before an election, when changing or renewing a license or ID card at least 30 days before an election, by filling out a form at the county auditor’s office within 30 days before an election, or at the polling location on the day of the election. Sponsor Rep. Mike Schatz says the purpose is to make sure people aren’t voting for other party candidates during the primary election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During primaries voters are required to vote for just one of the multiple parties listed on the ballot. Failure to do so causes the ballot to be spoiled and uncounted. Senate Bill 2178 looks to avoid this problem. The bill would </span><a href="https://www.kfyrtv.com/2025/01/23/senate-bill-looks-create-separate-ballots-primary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require election officials to provide separate ballots with only one party available to choose from</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sen. Chuck Walen, R-New Town, says another purpose of the legislation is that it gives political parties and candidates access to information allowing them to know who voted for what party. The Secretary of State’s Office says this would at least triple the cost of printing ballots and could increase the chance of poll worker error at the polls. The Senate </span><a href="https://www.jamestownsun.com/news/north-dakota/north-dakota-senate-votes-down-change-to-primary-election-ballots"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted against the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

The two bills, which would amend some of the same sections of existing state law, are yet to be reconciled. Both bills now head to the Senate. The House voted</span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Vote/80715"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 37-31</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to advance</span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25746"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would make the voter registration list freely available online, after debate over funding and privacy implications.  The bill would mandate the Secretary of State’s Office to publish the list online, with weekly updates, and to maintain historical archives. Supporters said the bill would reduce barriers to election oversight, citing costs of current voter lists, which are priced at $2,500 per request and up to $3,000 for absentee data. The fees collected to obtain the voter registration list are used for upkeep and technical support for the state’s Total Vote system, which is used statewide by county auditors and the Secretary of State’s Office to manage voter registration and election data. The bill does not include funding to offset the lost fees. The Secretary of State’s Office — which spoke in opposition to the bill during its initial committee hearing — said the total fees came to about $100,000 last year. The</span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/25459"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would forbid public access to voters’ phone numbers and emails passed</span><a href="https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Vote/80717"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 40-28</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Rep. Mike Weisgram, R-Fort Pierre, proposed that bill. He said the goal is to limit the number of political texts and emails voters are subjected to during elections.  The bill would prohibit public access to telephone numbers and email addresses on voter registration forms, in addition to existing protections for Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and full dates of birth. Weisgram said the bill ensures that disclosures of voter registration information cannot be exploited by campaigns or commercial interests.</span></p>

However, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 2024 executive order accelerated the process to daily purges, raising concern about its impact on voters.  Now, Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, is leading an effort to address the controversy and assure compliance with federal law. On Monday, the Senate passed his</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB813"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to clarify the federal 90-day threshold for voter roll removals and extend the response time for flagged individuals to contest their potential purge.   Rouse’s bill would increase the response time from 14 days to 28 days after a notice is mailed to the individual.  “A key word there is ‘mailed to them,’” Rouse said, highlighting the ongoing issues with slow mail delivery. “I think we all understand that mail has been quite slow these days.” The proposal has successfully cleared the Senate by a 20-18 vote but must pass the House of Delegates before heading to the governor. </span></p>

One would note the box is the property of the county that bought the box. The other would state tampering with the box may violate state and federal law. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Jeff Wilson, R-Longview, said the deliberately set fire in Vancouver before the election inspired the legislation. Washington has between 545 and 560 drop boxes. Officials project the new labeling proposed under Wilson’s bill would cost about $1,000 for each box.  But the cost could vary by county. For example, Kittitas County paid $222 to wrap each of its nine boxes, while King County estimates it will cost $1,350 per box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another measure Wilson has proposed,</span><a href="https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2025-26/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/5010.pdf?q=20250124130129"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 5010</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would create a grant program in the secretary of state’s office for counties to install cameras around ballot boxes. That bill hasn’t been scheduled for a public hearing.</span></p>

An attempt to implement ranked choice voting failed during the 2024 legislative session, but democratic lawmakers have brought it back, hoping the second time&#8217;s the charm. House Bill 1448 is not a statewide mandate — it’s more of a local-choice model, allowing communities to decide if they’re ready to make the switch. For those who opt in, the bill sets some clear guidelines: Ballots must be easy to understand, vote-counting processes must be straightforward and the transition has to happen within two years of adoption. To help local governments figure it all out, the bill creates a ranked choice voting work group. This group will assist the secretary of state with developing training and voter education materials, so everyone — from election officials to voters — knows how the system works. It’s about ensuring the transition is smooth, not overwhelming.</span></p>

House Bill 160, “Voter identification-revisions,” would remove student IDs issued by the University of Wyoming, the state’s community colleges and public schools from Wyoming’s list of acceptable IDs for voting purposes. The House Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee voted 8 to 1 to approve the bill. The bill aligns with Secretary of State Chuck Gray’s “election integrity agenda,” which he announced ahead of the Wyoming Legislature’s 2025 general session. Third on that list was “strengthening Wyoming’s voter ID statute.” Gray told the committee he supported the bill. He said student IDs don’t indicate whether someone is an American citizen and could lead to voter fraud, as they’re easily counterfeited. “That’s really the problem here. There’s no statutory or any process safeguards on these other than the policies that the institutions put in place, which can always change,” Gray said. Sublette County Clerk Mary Lankford said students are able to register to vote with the student ID with a driver’s license number or Social Security number so a clerk can verify their citizenship and residency. Lankford added, though, that the state’s county clerks have some concern about student IDs allowing students to use a nickname and select their own photo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House advanced a bill that would allow for </span><a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/01/27/house-advances-bill-allowing-hand-counted-recounts-of-wyoming-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recounting elections by hand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. House Bill 232 would initiate hand recounts for many races in Wyoming.  The bill was passed 6-1 by the House Appropriations Committee with only Rep. Trey Sherwood, D-Laramie, voting against it. If enacted into law, the bill apportions $200,000 for the state to run, a figure Secretary of State Chuck Gray said he supports to facilitate hand-counted recounts. Hand counting elections has gained steam since the 2020 election after allegations of fraud were brought by some Republicans against voting machines. Various attempts to perform hand count elections and audits of elections have mostly failed to date. HB 232 would not only perform election recounts conducted by hand instead of voting machines for close races, but also if an individual requests it. The bill sponsor, Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland, believes the bill will also provide an avenue for catching human mistakes fed into the voting machines that might not otherwise currently exist in state law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House passed first reading of</span><a href="https://wyoleg.gov/2025/Bills/HB0173.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would m</span><a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/01/28/house-supports-bill-making-wyomings-sore-loser-election-law-obsolete/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ove the date to file as an independent candidate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to well before the primary, thus eliminating the ability for people to run after certain candidates lose their primary elections. Current statute, often referred to by its critics as the “sore loser law,” allows people to file as independent candidates up to 70 days before the general election and then run in that election. This gives people the ability to file their candidacy for about 10 days after the primary election. The bill sponsor, state Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland, said he’s had county elections staff complain to him about the 70-day rule, which gives the clerks a short window to print ballots for Wyoming residents voting from overseas. This has occurred a few times around the state over the last few years. Some of the candidates were candid when speaking to Cowboy State Daily about the results of the primary election being their inspiration for running. Haroldson said the bill does not stop independents from running for office.</span></p>

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the League of Women Voters, the Arctic Village Council and two individual Alaska voters who said their rights were violated because they did not have an opportunity to correct mistakes on their ballots, which meant their votes weren’t counted. Lamoureux ruled against the plaintiffs last week She said in her</span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25505898/decision-aclu-of-alaska.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 32-page ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the state’s requirements for absentee voters “impose only a limited burden on the right to vote.” The lawsuit followed the state’s first by-mail election in 2022. Almost 7,500 absentee ballots were rejected, with a greater proportion of those rejected ballots coming from parts of the state where Alaska Natives make up a majority of the population. Two-thirds of those rejected ballots were for mistakes made on envelopes containing the ballots.</span></p>

Bryer </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/judge-dismisses-challenge-to-marin-county-california-voter-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismissed a lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking to remove hundreds of allegedly ineligible voters from the voter rolls in Marin County, California. Bryer said the plaintiffs lacked standing and failed to state a claim in their complaint. A group of seven voters filed a lawsuit in October 2024 against the Marin County registrar and California Secretary of State Shirley Weber (D) for allegedly failing to remove ineligible voters from the county’s voter rolls. Plaintiffs asserted without evidence that Marin County had mailed ballots to 994 ineligible voters for the 2024 general election, and that 142 ballots were expected to be returned. Breyer denied the request for a temporary restraining order for lack of standing Nov. 4, 2024. He also indicated then that the plaintiffs’ claims were unlikely to succeed.  In January, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing and did not sufficiently allege a violation of any law.  Marin County voter roll maintenance processes will remain unchanged following Breyer’s Monday order.</span></p>

At the time, police said he brandished the machete outside the polling place and targeted a 71-year-old woman and a 54-year-old woman. Additional charges of voter intimidation and suppression were later added.  However, Assistant State Attorney Octavius A.

The panel wrestled with the role of race in elections after a judge ruled in October 2023 that Georgia’s districts were drawn in a way that weakened the voting strength of Black voters. If the courts agree with the state’s argument that partisan politics — not race — explains voting patterns, violations of the Voting Rights Act would be more difficult to prove. Black voters overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates in Georgia, while most white voters back Republicans. The 11th Circuit judges are expected to rule in the coming months. The decision could then be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the Voting Rights Act’s protections for Black voters in recent redistricting cases.</span></p>

It named 41 counts and 18 defendants, including Trump’s close advisors Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows and John Eastman. The indictment charged Trump with 13 counts. The counts deal with soliciting others to engage in conduct that willfully and intentionally violates a Georgia public official’s oath of office, which includes a promise to uphold the state and national constitutions. In particular, the counts reference conversations with Georgia legislators and Raffensperger in which the defendants asked them to change election results, decertify the election, and call a special session of the state legislature to unlawfully appoint electors.</span></p>

The justices, without comment, turned away an appeal from Mississippi residents who have completed their sentences, but who have been unable to regain their right to vote. The court’s action let stand a ruling by the full 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that rejected the claim that permanent loss of voting rights amounted to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Constitution. Mississippi legislators, not the courts, must decide whether to change the laws, the 5th circuit said. Using different legal arguments, lawyers failed to get the Supreme Court to take up the felon disenfranchisement issue in 2023, over a dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that was joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Mississippi’s list of disqualifying crimes was “adopted for an illicit discriminatory purpose,” Jackson wrote. No justice noted a dissent from this week’s order.</span></p>

Steinheimer said the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the case in the first place.  Right-wing organization Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF) and a voter filed the lawsuit in May 2024 after allegedly discovering nearly 50 commercial addresses listed in the Washoe County voter rolls. In their complaint against Washoe County interim register Carrie-Ann Burgess, the plaintiffs argued the addresses violated a state law that requires voters to provide a residential address when they register to vote. They asked the court to order Burgess to investigate the commercial addresses.  Burgess and Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar (D), who intervened in the case, argued that the plaintiffs were trying to circumvent the official voter challenge process. An investigation into the addresses, they argued, has the effect of a voter challenge and could result in voters being removed from the rolls. But effective voter challenges must be based on reasonable and reliable information, which Burgess and Aguilar claimed the plaintiffs could not meet, and so the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit seeking the same result. They also argued the plaintiffs had no standing.</span></p>

Initially, they were charged with three felony counts of voter fraud for casting ballots in the November 2020 general election, November 2022 Concord Board of Education, and November 2022 general election. One charge was converted to a misdemeanor, and two other felonies were nolle prossed as part of the plea deal. The two previously lived in Concord and still own rental property there.

The county reached a settlement in which the suburban region, located just east of New York City borough of Queens, would create six voting districts in which Black, Latino and Asian residents constitute a majority of eligible voters. The county’s Republican-controlled legislature approved a voting map in 2023 in which residents of color constituted a majority of eligible voters in just four of the county’s 19 districts. But the New York Civil Liberties Union and other groups sued in state court, arguing the map diluted the electoral power of residents of color, who make up more than one-third of eligible voters. They said the political map, based off the 2020 census, split minority communities or combined them with others that were starkly different. The new voting map will take effect for legislative elections this coming November and remain in effect after the 2030 census, when maps will be redrawn to reflect updated census counts, the New York Civil Liberties Union and other groups said. The local Republican Party said it remains committed to “fair and competitive” districts and is confident it will retain its majority in the legislature.</span></p>

The state Board of Elections and Justice Allison Riggs are appealing a federal district court judge’s decision to send back to state court an elections case in which Republican Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin wants to invalidate more than 60,000 votes. Griffin had asked the state Supreme Court to order the elections board to erase those votes, believing that doing so would allow him to erase Riggs’ 734 vote lead. Last week, the state Supreme Court dismissed Griffin’s request that it order the elections board to throw out ballots and told the Wake County Superior Court to start a trial. It also kept in place a block on certification of a winner in the race. The case has taken several turns in the weeks since the state Board of Elections dismissed his protests. The panel of three judges on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals is considering whether the case should be heard in federal court or stay in state court. Riggs and the state Board of Elections want the case in federal court, while Griffin wants state courts to consider the claims. Where the case is heard could determine the winner of the election. The state Supreme Court race is the last statewide race in the nation that does not have a declared winner. The high court currently features a 5-2 Republican majority, including Riggs, who has recused herself from the case. The courtroom in Richmond was packed this week with North Carolina voters. “I can’t believe that so many people would be interested in this case that was so procedural,” said Judge Paul V. Niemeyer, who was appointed by President George H.W. Bush.</span></p>

According to the indictment, Bernard knowingly used a false address on a Robertson County Election Commission Candidate Nomination Petition to run for Orlinda City Commissioner in August 2024. Bernard is accused of putting a Moore Street address on her nominating petition when she actually lived at a Sparkman Road address, per the indictment. The violation is considered a Class D felony in Tennessee, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 12 years imprisonment and $5,000 fine.</span></p>

The department’s motion for dismissal, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and first reported by Votebeat, doesn’t end the case, because there are also private plaintiffs, including voting rights groups, challenging Virginia’s action. The motion came soon after the Justice Department, now under the Trump administration, reversed the Biden administration’s position in a case involving Louisiana’s congressional maps, and amid a reported reconsideration of the department’s approach to civil rights cases. Some voting rights watchdogs fear that the department’s priorities will shift under the new leadership. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing. The case arose after Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, issued an executive order in August requiring daily updates to voter lists to remove ineligible voters. The Justice Department and other organizations separately sued Virginia in October, saying the order violated a provision of the National Voter Registration Act, which includes a ban on systematic cleaning of voter rolls within 90 days of a federal election.</span></p>
