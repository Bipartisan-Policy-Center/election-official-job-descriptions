							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Helping America Vote: The Book</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Wendy Underhill<br />
</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Conference of State Legislatures</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a pop quiz: How do elections work in the U.S.?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) Accurately and transparently, given how much double-checking is built into the processes that govern voter registration, voting and counting ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) Differently, at least a little bit, depending on the state or jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">c) With support from fellow Americans who have chosen to be election professionals, and 700,000 others who serve as temporary election workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">d) All of the above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short answer is, of course, d.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12786" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-23-at-1.30.42 PM-223x300.png" alt="" width="223" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-23-at-1.30.42 PM-223x300.png 223w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-23-at-1.30.42 PM-761x1024.png 761w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-23-at-1.30.42 PM-768x1033.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-23-at-1.30.42 PM-1142x1536.png 1142w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-23-at-1.30.42 PM.png 1206w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />For a longer answer, see</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/helping-america-vote-election-administration-in-the-united-states"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Helping America Vote: Election Administration in the U.S.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new publication from the bipartisan <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> (EAC) and the also-bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The title plays off the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3295">Help America Vote Act of 2002</a>, the most recent major federal legislation to address elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though federal laws matter, “elections are a state responsibility; the constitution is clear on that,” says Tim Storey, NCSL’s chief executive officer. “No wonder then that procedures vary across the states and territories. It is impossible to give a single answer to how elections work without diving deep into details.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the 190-page Helping America Vote primer provides a procedural overview. It starts with how electoral districts and precincts are created, and then follows through with candidate filing, ballot design, voter registration, voting itself either on or before Election Day, election certification and results auding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book also addresses the complex web that governs elections, plus voting technology, specific needs of military and overseas voters, how presidential elections compare to all other elections, and alternative voting methods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book is 100% descriptive (and 0% prescriptive). NCSL and the EAC recognized that those who are new to election administration or new to policymaking on elections (think: lawmakers) needed a soup-to-nuts explanation of the steps it takes to run an accurate, secure and accessible election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a great resource for the most fundamental and best practices across the country,” said Commissioner Don Palmer, one of the four EAC commissioners. “If you are interested in audits, go to the audit chapter. You’ll find plenty of ideas. The same with any other question. There’s a chapter on it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To balance the reference book style, each chapter has an interview with an election official who brings that topic to life. Common threads from these 19 interviews? Election officials will make just about anything lawmakers want to have happen, happen—they just need time and resources. And they will do their work outside the reach of politics. They focus on “what can work not for your party, and not for my party, but for the American people,” EAC Commissioner Tom Hicks reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helping America Vote, we hope and expect, will be a reference that election officials and others can dip into to get what they want, when they want it,” Storey said. “And, because it does not include state-by-state data, this book will be evergreen, with a years-long shelf life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For state-by-state data,</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/ncsl-election-resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> NCSL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the</span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> EAC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> both provide up-to-the-minute resources that can and are changed as states adjust their processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Other Books on Election Administration</strong><br />
</span><a href="https://press.georgetown.edu/Book/How-We-Vote"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How We Vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Kathleen Hale and Mitchell Brown (Georgetown University Press, 2020) comes close, but focuses on the election officials’ role and provides academic analysis. The same with</span><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-70227-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Local Election Administrators in the United States: The Frontline of Democracy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Palgrave Macmillan Cham, 2024), which gathers essays from leading scholars in the field of election science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there’s the venerable</span><a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/election-administration-united-states-1934-joseph-p-harris-phd"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Election Administration in the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, by Joseph P. Harris (Brookings Institution, 1934, now available as a pdf from the National Institute of Standards and Technology). While interesting to see that the issues identified in the 1930s are still with the nation almost a century later: who is eligible to vote and how do we know that; where and how voting takes place; how to secure processes and votes. </span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Federal Update</strong>: There was more elections-related action in Washington this week. According to Democracy Docket, on April 11 the U.S. Election Assistance Commission sent a letter to state elections officials</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/trump-election-executive-order-elections-assistance-commission/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “seeking consultation” on how they would apply President Donald J. Trump’s  proof of citizenship demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if his executive order ultimately stands — and how the new requirement would affect voter registration in their states. According to the article, even though there is litigation pending against the EO, the EAC is nonetheless moving forward and initiated the process of putting the citizenship requirement into effect. In the letter, which was sent by EAC Executive Director Briannna Schletz, the commission also described Trump’s order as providing “instruction to the EAC.” Chairman Donald Palmer</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-elections-voting-executive-order-eac-419ed4db0ea30b69bf47d11647a6b816?user_email=594ea5f0f5317563502975ed318ebbd4d3c386022fc550eca0e70c06903bd8eb&amp;utm_medium=Afternoon_Wire&amp;utm_source=Sailthru_AP&amp;utm_campaign=AfternoonWire_April23_2025&amp;utm_term=Afternoon%20Wire"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told The Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the agency was following the law, which governs the way any proposed change to the federal form can be made. “That’s the process that we’ve done in the past, and that’s the process we did this time,” Palmer said. “In my mind, this is really to get information from the states.” According to Reuters, the </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-department-reassigns-about-dozen-civil-rights-attorneys-amid-shakeup-2025-04-22/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Justice Department is reassigning about a dozen senior career attorneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from its civil rights units as the administration steers the division away from its historic priorities. At least three senior career attorneys who managed offices that investigated abuse by police and handled violations of voting and disability rights, have been ordered to take other assignments, three of the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss moves that had not been made public, told Reuters. “It’s been a complete bloodbath,” </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-upends-dojs-civil-rights-division-sparking-bloodbath-senior-rank-rcna202622"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said a senior Justice Department lawyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the division who is not authorized to speak publicly. The </span><a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/04/17/military-families-challenge-trumps-stricter-federal-voting-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secure Families Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has joined a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Trump&#8217;s executive order imposing stricter voting requirements, arguing it would add barriers for troops and families who vote by absentee ballot. The biggest effect on military voter participation is likely the new ballot return deadline, said Sarah Streyder, a military wife living overseas who serves as the executive director of the Secure Families Initiative. On the security front, Bob Lord, senior technical adviser and Lauren Zabierek, senior advisor at </span><a href="https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-bob-lord-lauren-zabierek-resign-secure-by-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CISA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, were two of the chief architects behind CISA’s Secure by Design initiative, which garnered voluntary commitments from major vendors and manufacturers to build cybersecurity protections into their products at the design stage have departed the agency. And </span><a href="https://cyberscoop.com/chris-krebs-resigns-sentinelone-fight-trump-executive-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Krebs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has resigned from SentinelOne, saying he needs to devote himself fully to fighting the executive order President Donald Trump signed to target the former CISA director. On the Congressional front, the California Association of Clerks and Elections Officials <a href="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CACEOSAVEActLetter.pdf">sent a letter</a> to key members of the Senate expressing their concerns about the SAVE Act. </span></p>

The features could include watermarks or invisible fibers, according to a contract with election printing vendor Runbeck Election Services that county supervisors unanimously voted to approve this week. The features will cost somewhere between 10 to 15 cents a ballot, according to Runbeck’s proposal. About 83,000 Mohave County voters cast ballots in the last midterm election. Supervisors Chairman Travis Lingenfelter told Votebeat in an interview that he thinks the change is worth the cost if it improves voter confidence, and he hopes other counties will follow. Runbeck said it can offer invisible fibers, a watermark, an infrared taggant and paper that doesn’t respond to UV light. It’s unclear at this point which features Mohave County will add, or how much it will ultimately cost. A recent test in Cochise County found that voting machines from Election Systems &amp; Software, which Mohave County also uses, can properly tabulate ballots using Runbeck’s features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10128" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/OttowaCoMI-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />New Site Who ‘Dis</strong>: The Ottawa County, Michigan clerk’s office is </span><a href="https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/lakeshore/ottawa/maps-charts-and-graphs-ottawa-county-to-launch-new-election-results-website"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set to launch a new website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in advance of the May primary. A part of the county&#8217;s push for &#8220;continuous improvement&#8221; in its elections, the new website will allow users to interact with the results through a series of charts and graphs. A map feature will also let voters view results in specific precincts, so they can focus on a candidate&#8217;s performance in their hometown. &#8220;I always say that accuracy is more important than timeliness,&#8221; said Ottawa County Clerk Justin Roebuck. &#8220;But timeliness is really an important aspect of our customer service and building trust and confidence in the election process.&#8221; Downloadable reports will be available, too. &#8220;I might not be the only election nerd in Ottawa County who likes that kind of stuff,&#8221; Roebuck said. &#8220;We want to make sure we&#8217;ve got a good, transparent reporting process.&#8221; In August 2024, Ottawa County&#8217;s current unofficial election results website crashed shortly after polls closed on Tuesday night. Thousands of visitors had generated more than 100,000 hits, trying to view a number of hotly-contested primary races for county commission. &#8220;That obviously overtaxed the website,&#8221; Roebuck said, adding that the county was already shopping for new software at the time. &#8220;This [new website] is a great step forward in continuously improving that process.&#8221; The new website, capable of handling large amounts of traffic, comes courtesy of a four-year contract ($9,000 per year) with SOE Software, with an option for a three-year renewal at the same rate.</span></p>

After the submission deadline on Jan. 31, Gilmour said city employees voted for their top three designs. The six with the most votes then went to the City Council, who voted for the top two.   “It was a hard call because all the designs showed great imagination and local pride,” Gilmour said. </span></p>

But people awaiting trial and those convicted of misdemeanor charges, which made up 30 percent of the state’s incarcerated population in 2019, are eligible voters. However, Ashley McCarthy, director of external affairs for the Connecticut Department of Corrections, said that logistical challenges often discourage eligible incarcerated people from voting. McCarthy explained that they must undergo a time-consuming process: requesting voter registration paperwork from their prison unit manager or counselor and filling it out; requesting an application for an absentee ballot from their town clerk; completing the application and mailing it to their town clerk; receiving and filling out the absentee ballot itself; and mailing the absentee ballot to their town clerk.  By requiring Department of Corrections facilities to carry special absentee ballots, the bill would streamline this process for eligible voters. The only mail the prisoners would have to send would be the ballot itself.</span></p>

The bipartisan Board of State Canvassers unanimously approved a 96-word summary of the proposal that will appear on petitions around Michigan. That starts a 180-day clock for the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights, a group that’s leading the petition drive, to gather nearly 450,000 valid signatures from registered voters across the state. The group, which also operates under the name “Prove It, Michigan,” has previously challenged state-level expansions to voting rights. Petition circulators will have 180 days from approval to gather 446,198 valid signatures of registered voters, a number based on the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial race. After the signatures are submitted, the state will have to verify them. If enough valid ones are gathered, the question will appear on next fall’s ballot.</span></p>

Chairman of the House Elections and Apportionment committee Rep. Timothy Wesco, R-Osceola, offered an amendment to the bill to remove the requirement for the circuit court clerk to transmit a copy of each oath taken by a ballot counter for the 2024 election. The amendment was adopted unanimously during a March House Elections and Apportionment committee meeting. The bill was held during the March 26 committee meeting and was not heard in committee after that. </span></p>

Identical bills introduced in sessions dating back to 2017 haven’t found traction. Though the legislation only calls for the study of the technology’s potential use, by first enlisting experts in blockchain technology, voter fraud, cybersecurity, voter records and election results, reception of such technologies in 2025 remains tepid at best. Vanel, an intellectual property attorney and Democrat, in 2019 said he believed that governments must not neglect cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology. He pointed to a 2016 New York City Board of Elections scandal in which 117,000 Brooklyn voters were improperly purged from voter rolls, an incident he said could have been sidestepped if the board had been using an immutable public ledger like that offered by blockchain.</span></p>

The amendment was made to comply with a March 25 executive order issued by President Donald Trump that forbids states from counting mail-in ballots received after Election Day. The bill was originally intended to clean up state law governing elections procedures. The main purpose of the bill is to make ballots easier for voters to understand and make election practices more uniform across the state. It addresses things like write-in candidate deadlines, what counts as a valid residential address and who can remove election judges, for example. The Senate State and Local Government Committee during committee discussion earlier this month added the deadline change for mail-in ballots. The amendment was brought by the Secretary of State’s Office, according to Deputy Secretary of State Sandra McMerty. McMerty in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor said the change was suggested to comply with the executive order and to “remove uncertainty and inconsistencies surrounding postmarking requirements of the USPS.”  Since the amendment was introduced after the bill’s public hearing in the Senate, the public did not have an opportunity to comment on the proposed changes. McMerty said the Secretary of State’s Office doesn’t anticipate the change causing any problems either. “We don’t foresee significant barriers to voters as 0.1% of absentee ballots in the general election were postmarked prior to Election Day and delivered to the county after Election Day,” she told the Monitor. The Senate last week voted 43-4 to pass the bill. The House on Monday approved the amended bill by a vote of 85-7.</span></p>

Current Tennessee law already requires positions like governor, state legislators and U.S. senators and representatives to be nominated by primary election.  “This bill ensures Tennessee voters, not party insiders, choose their candidates,” Reeves said in a press release. “I’m proud to stand with the busy parents, deployed service members, first responders, senior citizens and other Tennesseans who want their voice heard. The voters of Tennessee stand with me on this issue and want accessible, transparent and fair opportunities to choose their nominees.”  Any statewide political party that used non-primary methods to nominate candidates in 2022 or 2024 may continue doing so for county offices, but this clause only applies to a handful of small counties across the state. The bill also provides exceptions for unexpected vacancies that must be filled outside of a typical election cycle.</span></p>

Kollar-Kotelly said she would consider each party’s responses to her questions and aim for a ruling this week, although none had been delivered at press time. The Democratic National Committee, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the League of Women Voters Education Fund and others are seeking to block Trump’s sweeping overhaul of federal election processes, which, among other changes, would require proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. The Republican president’s</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-elections-trump-executive-order-4e9edb53f47e61e241a43ceef8164022"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says the U.S. has failed “to enforce basic and necessary election protections” and calls on states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election crimes. It threatens to pull federal funding from states where election officials don’t comply. The plaintiffs argue the order is illegal because it asserts power that he does not have over an independent agency. That agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, sets voluntary voting system guidelines and maintains the federal voter registration form. The plaintiffs also argue the order violates the Constitution, which says that states — not the president — get to decide the “times, places and manner” of how elections are run. The Constitution’s so-called Elections Clause also gives Congress the power to “make or alter” election regulations, at least for federal office, but it doesn’t mention any presidential authority over election administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5219" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ARkansas-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Arkansas:</strong> The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals heard a Voting Rights Act case last week concerning the </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/eighth-circuit-probes-arkansas-limits-on-voter-assistance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legality of an Arkansas voter assistance provision </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">prohibiting anyone other than an election official from assisting more than six voters per election. The state claims the provision was passed in 2009 as part of a “commonsense” package of bills designed to make voting easier and cheating more difficult. The six-voter limit was designed to protect against abuse by “would-be professional voter assistants” who are interested in influencing the outcome of an election.  In 2022, a lower court enjoined the state from enforcing the provision after agreeing with a group of Hispanic plaintiffs that it violated Section 208 of the VRA. Section 208 states that all individuals who need assistance when voting can receive that assistance from a person of their choice. A nonprofit group called Arkansas United claimed the law prevented it from fulfilling its mission of assisting voters with limited English proficiency in translating and understanding their ballots at polling places. But Arkansas Solicitor General Autumn Hamit Patterson told the appellate panel on Thursday that Section 208 does not contain its own cause of action, and the lower court applied the wrong legal standard when enjoining the state.  “Arkansas’ provision helps ensure that voters who require assistance to vote retain some privacy in their votes and are able to cast their ballot without undue influence, intimidation or fraud affecting their ability to vote,” Patterson argued. She said the Eighth Circuit has previously decided — in Arkansas State Conference v. Arkansas Board of Apportionment — that voters may not sue to protect their voting rights under Section 208.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The League of Women Voters of Arkansas filed a federal lawsuit this week alleging that </span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/04/21/federal-lawsuit-challenges-arkansas-restrictions-citizen-led-ballot-initiatives/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eight new laws governing direct democracy are unconstitutional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Republican supermajority in the Arkansas Legislature passed a slew of bills during the 2025 legislative session, which ended last week, placing new restrictions on the solicitation, collection and submission of signatures for citizen-led ballot initiatives. Democratic lawmakers and members of the public said the restrictions will have a chilling effect on the people’s right to have a say in their own laws and Constitution.

A sponsor of a ballot measure would be fined $2,500 per paid canvasser hired who does not meet this requirement. The plaintiffs also ask the court to block defendant Secretary of State Cole Jester from enforcing four of the challenged laws — Acts 218, 240, 241 and 274 — due to the Arkansas Constitution’s provision that ensures the right to direct democracy. The complaint also asks the court to declare portions of existing ballot initiative law adopted since 2013 unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions.</span></p>

The U.S. Justice Department in March submitted a federal court filing in support of Tina Peters&#8217; fight to be freed from prison while she appeals a state court conviction for allowing Trump supporters to access election equipment. The federal agency said it was reviewing whether Peters&#8217; prosecution was &#8220;oriented more toward inflicting political pain than toward pursuing actual justice.” But Chief Deputy Attorney General Natalie Hanlon Leh said in the hearing that the government hasn’t presented any evidence of potential wrongdoing. She asked Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak to reject the government&#8217;s filing or at least strike the line suggesting political motivations. Varholak noted that under former President Joe Biden, the Justice Department helped investigate Peters and would have access to materials in the case. The judge pressed the government to provide evidence warranting a review. But Abigail Stout, a Justice Department lawyer in Washington, said she was not authorized to discuss any ongoing review and had no knowledge of any evidence.</span></p>

In October, Morales and Rokita petitioned the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) — which is housed within the homeland security agency — to review lists of voters who registered without providing a state-issued form of identification. Federal officials “have failed to provide information that would enable Indiana to verify that only eligible voters participated in elections,” Morales’ and Rokita’s offices alleged in news releases. Though Trump took office in January, his administration has also declined to respond to Indiana’s request. Over a dozen other states have filed similar missives. “Following the Biden administration’s obstruction here, I expect that President (Donald) Trump’s team will resolve this matter,” Rokita said in the release. “This lawsuit is another important step in ensuring the integrity of our elections. Hoosiers have a right to know that legitimate ballots are not being diluted by noncitizens. I promised that I would get citizenship information from USCIS, and that is exactly what I am doing by filing this suit.” </span></p>

The RNC sued over what it said were excessively high fees — nearly $5,000 — the city charged in response to a public records request submitted on Nov. 26. The RNC is seeking copies of surveillance video from absentee ballot drop boxes in the city on Nov. 5, Election Day. Similar requests had been sent to East Lansing, Delta Township, Flint, Detroit, Battle Creek and Muskegon, among others. Lansing charged significantly more for its records, according to the RNC lawsuit. Lansing estimated a $4,795 fee and $2,397 deposit to provide the video footage, while other cities estimated less than $700, including East Lansing, which wanted about $300, and Battle Creek, which charged $140. The RNC appealed the fee, which the city denied, and then filed suit in Ingham County Circuit Court in early February. The city responded on April 7. Attorneys for the city said it acted in good faith and complied with the state&#8217;s public records law and therefore the RNC has no valid claim to sue over. They asked Ingham County Circuit Judge Morgan Cole to dismiss the lawsuit and order that the RNC pay for the city&#8217;s attorney fees.</span></p>

Josh Stein (D) and declaring the law unconstitutional. </span><a href="https://ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/S382"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 382</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, passed late last year, shifted a number of aspects of executive branch power within the state away from the incoming governor. Among those changes were steering control of the elections board — which is currently overseen by the governor and has a Democratic majority — to newly elected auditor Dave Boliek, a Republican. Citing a series of prior rulings on executive power and elections board control, the Wake County Superior Court judges wrote that the law was unconstitutional and should be permanently enjoined. “Because the duty to faithfully execute the laws has been exclusively assigned to the governor, Senate Bill 382 cannot reassign that duty to the auditor without violating the constitution,” wrote Judges Edwin G. Wilson, Jr., a Democrat,  and Lori I. Hamilton, a Republican. Judge R. Andrew Womble, a Republican, dissented from the pair’s ruling, writing that the legislature was “expressly authorized” to shift duties to the auditor. Boliek said he would appeal the ruling. “My office remains ready, willing, and able to take on the duties and responsibilities of overseeing board of elections appointments and budget administration,” he said in a statement. “I stand by my arguments and will promptly be appealing this ruling.” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) also said he would appeal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the State Board of Elections </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/us-appeals-court-pauses-nc-elections-board-action-in-the-supreme-court-election-case/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not to send information to overseas or military absentee voters </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">about providing photo ID, granting a stay that Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs requested. It’s the latest development in the nearly six-month-old dispute over last November’s election for an associate justice seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court. Federal District Judge Richard Myers II told the Board of Elections earlier this month to prepare to act on the state high court’s instructions to notify some military and overseas absentee voters they need to supply photo ID for their votes in last fall’s election for a seat on the high court to count.  This week’s  2-1 Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals order stops that action before Myers makes a decision on Riggs’ request for a preliminary injunction. The state Supreme Court said overseas and military voters would have 30 days to “cure” their ballots once the Board of Elections sent out notices.  Riggs filed a federal appeal. Myers told the Board of Elections to get to work implementing the Supreme Court order, but to not certify a winner.  Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, appointed by President George H.W. Bush, and Toby J. Heytens, appointed by President Joe Biden, decided to grant the stay. Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr., appointed by President Donald Trump, dissented.  The state Board of Elections told local elections administrators last week not to contact overseas or military voters, citing the ongoing litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the <em>News &amp; Observer</em>, national Democrats and Republicans appear to have reached an </span><a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article304812436.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreement to resolve a longstanding lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">over North Carolina’s voting laws. In 2023, North Carolina Republicans passed a law restricting this practice as part of a massive elections omnibus bill called Senate Bill 747. National Democrats and advocacy groups sued over the bill, saying it could lead to votes being unfairly thrown out. This week, parties in that lawsuit announced that they had reached an agreement with Republicans to terminate the litigation in exchange for changes to the law’s implementation that would give voters an opportunity to ensure their vote isn’t cancelled. In January 2024, a federal judge blocked that change from taking effect, saying that voters would “face a non-trivial risk of being erroneously disenfranchised” if the address verification failed due to governmental errors. He ordered the State Board of Elections to create a process for voters to fix any issues with their registration if their same-day registration notice was returned as undeliverable. This week’s agreement largely codifies the judge’s 2024 order and the board’s process for implementing it, with both parties agreeing that voters will be given a chance to remedy an address verification failure before their votes are cancelled.</span></p>

Zada pleaded guilty to knowingly receiving, attempting to receive and conspiring to receive a firearm and ammunition to be used to commit terrorism, prosecutors with the Western District of Oklahoma said in a press release. Prosecutors said Zada, who was 17 when he was arrested in October, pleaded guilty as an adult and faces up to 15 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and deportation to Afghanistan upon his release. Prosecutors allege Zada and a co-conspirator, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, of Oklahoma City, obtained AK-47 assault rifles and ammunition and conspired to provide support to ISIS to conduct a November 2024 Election Day attack. Federal investigators have said Tawhedi, who is also an Afghan citizen, allegedly admitted that he planned to target large gatherings of people and said the two expected “to be martyred.” Tawhedi had also taken steps to liquidate his family’s assets and resettle his relatives overseas, officials said. Authorities said Tawhedi has been charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS, which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and receiving a firearm to commit a felony or federal crime of terrorism. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the latter offense.</span></p>

The lawsuit was filed in January. In it, the DOJ argued that the city&#8217;s method of electing council members results in fewer opportunities for Hispanic citizens. The DOJ said that despite the population of Hazleton being 40% Hispanic voting-age citizens, Hispanic-preferred candidates run and routinely lose. At a city council meeting shortly after the lawsuit was filed, council voted unanimously to include a question on the upcoming May primary ballots, asking voters if they&#8217;d want a commission to take a closer look at the way votes are collected for city council members. The city told us at that meeting that this vote had nothing to do with the lawsuit, and the commission had already been discussed prior to the filing. Now, the lawsuit has been voluntarily dismissed. In a press release, Hazleton Mayor Jeffrey Cusat said that the city believes the current system of electing five at-large council seats on rotating election cycles should continue. Cusat also said the city will continue to follow all state and county election laws until any changes that would come from a ballot referendum. </span></p>

Chris Daniel was one of 21 Republican candidates who filed election contest lawsuits after the results of the 2022 Harris County midterm elections. Daniel, who ran for Harris County District Clerk against Democratic incumbent Marilyn Burgess, alleged ballot paper shortages at several polling locations constituted &#8220;voter suppression,&#8221; and asked the court to overturn the results. Following a November 2023 trial court ruling in favor of Burgess, Daniel&#8217;s legal team filed an appeal. Republican chief justice for the 14th Court of Appeals, Tracy Christopher, wrote in an opinion that while some residents may have been prevented from voting, Daniel&#8217;s attorneys did not provide sufficient evidence to prove he would have won the election had they been able to cast ballots. &#8220;Daniel bore the burden to produce legally sufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could infer that the mistakes or misconduct of Harris County election officials prevented at least 25,640 eligible Harris County voters from voting on November 8, 2022,&#8221; the 14th Court of Appeals&#8217; opinion read. &#8220;Because he did not do so, we affirm the trial court’s judgment.&#8221;</span></p>

Two Brown County women, Jeanette Merten and Dawn McCole, argued the online voter registration system wasn’t secure and that the portal could allow changing a registered voter’s personal identity information, address or history. They wanted an injunction to take down the website until cybersecurity measures were implemented. Wolfe contended the lawsuit should be dismissed because the plaintiffs didn’t allege any plausible constitutional claim and because Wolfe’s role gives her Eleventh Amendment immunity from private lawsuits for her public work in federal court. Griesbach sided with Wolfe. In his ruling, he said the McCole and Merten didn’t claim any “particularized, concrete injury” that would give them standing to sue, not a conjectural or hypothetical harm. “The risk Plaintiffs complain of is generalized and not ‘personal and individual’ to them,&#8221; Griesbach wrote. Griesbach didn’t rule on the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims that the website is vulnerable. Specifically, they brought up the 2022 case of a Racine County man, Harry Wait, who used MyVote to request absentee ballots in the names of Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Racine’s mayor. Griesbach said the allegations “appear to raise serious concerns about the integrity of Wisconsin elections,” but that “there are no allegations that Wait filled out the ballots and submitted fraudulent votes.”</span></p>

Moderated by Votebeat Arizona reporter Jen Fifield, you’ll learn about the practical realities of requiring documented proof of citizenship for elections. Currently, there is no federal requirement to show proof of citizenship in order to vote. Instead, voters across the country must attest to their citizenship under penalty of perjury. President Donald Trump&#8217;s executive order on elections included a requirement for proof of citizenship. In Congress, the SAVE Act has a similar requirement and has passed the House. Three states have passed a proof of citizenship requirement in recent years, and several others are considering legislation. As the United States appears to be moving closer to requiring some form of citizenship proof in order to vote, this conversation will dive into the practical reality of administering elections with this requirement in place. Arizona has had a documented proof of citizenship requirement for state and local elections for twenty years, and officials determined in 2024 that state systems didn’t properly record the citizenship status of around 200,000 voters. This year, New Hampshire held its first election with a documented proof of citizenship requirement. Because it’s one of the six states that are not subject to the National Voter Registration Act, the law prevents anyone without documented proof of citizenship from voting in federal elections as well as state and local ones. <strong>When:</strong> May 14, 5pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</span></p>
