							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>“The Ways States Pay for Election Administration”</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By April Tan, Policy Lead and Shaniqua Williams, Research Fellow<br />
Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election administration is plagued by inconsistent and inadequate funding. This has major consequences for voters and places undue stress on officials. As demands on election systems grow, it is critical that administrators have enough funding to perform their duties effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9826" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CEIR-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CEIR-300x143.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CEIR.png 586w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />To inform the conversation around how states can provide sufficient and reliable funding to election officials, the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research (CEIR) released a</span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/ways-states-pay-for-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> examining different ways states pay for election administration. Election officials and policymakers can draw on the examples highlighted in the report as they look for ways to fund elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/ways-states-pay-for-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ways States Pay for Election Administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” describes seven broad categories of funding mechanisms, illustrated with state-specific examples from the last five years:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       Earmarking revenue</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       Automatic increases</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       Flexible funding</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       Non-public funding</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       Issuing bonds</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       Dedicated appropriations</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       Economies of scale</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The examples come from a scan of legislation enacted by states between 2019 and 2024. While not exhaustive, they showcase a range of approaches states have taken to meet evolving election needs. Some were designed to fund the implementation of new policies, while others aim to provide reliable funding streams or maximize available funding. Because election funding in the U.S. is highly decentralized and varies from state to state, needs and solutions differ by jurisdiction. Still, the models described can serve as a starting point for discussion and further research. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, the legislature appropriated tens of millions of dollars to implement new election policies including early voting and no-excuse absentee voting. The state allocated up to $30 million of those funds as incentive grants to encourage local jurisdictions to coordinate on implementing early voting. Without this funding, local jurisdictions would have had to bear the entire cost of implementing these policies.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">States may require funds to be earmarked for election expenses more broadly. In West Virginia, counties are required to set aside a portion of certain excise taxes for election administration, infrastructure, and security. The state prohibits these funds from being redirected for other purposes unless the secretary of state determines the county meets minimum requirements for reserve funding, physical security, and cybersecurity standards.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some states reimburse local jurisdictions for a portion of certain election expenses. For example, Washington makes sure local jurisdictions aren’t on the hook for the state’s share of expenses in statewide general elections by requiring the secretary of state to reimburse local jurisdictions for relevant expenses. The secretary must make a budget request to the legislature for more funding if the secretary does not have enough funding to reimburse all its expenses.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is no silver bullet to solve the election funding challenge, this report highlights some impactful and creative ways states can fund elections within existing public finance mechanisms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on funding mechanisms for election administration, read the report at</span><a href="https://electioninnovation.org/research/ways-states-pay-for-elections"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electioninnovation.org/research/ways-states-pay-for-elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on election funding, keep an eye out for CEIR’s upcoming report “Who Pays for Elections,” which explores how financial responsibility for elections is divided between state and local governments.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also that year, elections officials from all over the country gathered in New Orleans for Election Center’s first Annual Conference. </span></p>

According to Votebeat, DOJ is seeking additional information from </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/pennsylvania/2025/08/08/department-of-justice-requests-voter-rolls-pennsylvania/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a letter, sent to Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt on Aug. 4, DOJ asked the state for a copy of its voter rolls — which it had not requested in its previous communications with Pennsylvania about election security — as well as information on the state’s answer to a survey about election administration. According to Votebeat, </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/texas/2025/08/14/justice-department-letter-request-voter-roll-christina-adkins-election-division/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ letter from the DOJ is also seeking a list of state and local elections officials responsible for voter list maintenance since November 2022. Christina Adkins, director of the election division at the Texas Secretary of State’s Office told election officials this week that the state would handle the request from the Justice Department the same way it would a public-records request, as several other states have. Several states, including </span><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/08/12/trump-executive-order-on-voting-machines-puts-many-ohio-counties-in-limbo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and West Virginia are considering the impacts the March </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on elections may have on voting equipment in their states. The order directs federal officials to amend the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, which are indeed voluntary, but some states, including Ohio, require compliance with the most recent guidelines in state statute. The guidelines updates would bar voting machines “in which a vote is contained within a barcode or quick-response code” unless it’s necessary to accommodate people with disabilities. The order goes on to state ballots “should provide a voter-verifiable paper record.” According to the Ohio secretary of state, the majority of Ohio counties still use hand-marked paper ballots. But 28 counties use a machine that prints out voters’ selections, and another 13 use a machine that directly records a person’s vote while producing a paper record. </span><a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2025/08/11/wv-preparing-to-be-without-its-traditional-poll-machines-for-2026-primary-election-because-of-trump-executive-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">West Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secretary of State Kris Warner says the state is preparing to adjust. “Quite frankly, we have a plan B and a plan C based on whether we’re going to be able to use the machines that we’ve used in the past,” Warner said. “We’re hopeful that that’s going to be the case, but we’re unpacking that presidential executive order right now.”</span></p>

According to Votebeat, planning for the March 2026 primary election in </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/texas/2025/08/08/redistricting-halts-election-officials-preparations-march-primary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is already underway, but election officials say they can’t move forward without finalized maps — and the first key deadline, mandated by the state, is coming Sept. 9.  “Who knows if we’ll have enough time?” said Chris Davis, the voter registration director in Travis County. He told Votebeat the Sept. 9 deadline is when county precinct chairs — who represent their political party in a precinct within their neighborhood — can begin filing to run in the primary. A new map could shift precinct boundaries entirely. In </span><a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article311614230.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where a special election to ask residents if they want to redistrict could be held in conjunction with November elections. However, only 20 of the state’s 58 counties have some form of an election this fall and experts anticipate a statewide special election could cost up to $200 million. Some counties are already preparing for the possibility, “We usually send out military and overseas ballots 60 days before the election,” said </span><a href="https://www.ivpressonline.com/news/state-special-election-to-cost-county-up-to-600-000/article_65672467-27fb-40be-b0d9-05a67d34d000.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imperial County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Registrar of Voters Lindsay Dale. “It’s a very, very tight deadline.” The overall cost to hold the special election in the county, she said, would be between $500,000 and $600,000, and no one knows yet if the county would be reimbursed for the election cost. </span><a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2025/08/11/a-california-special-election-for-redistricting-isnt-official-yet-but-ocs-registrar-is-already-preparing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> registrar of voters Bob Page isn’t waiting around for the official call, according to the Orange County Register. He’s setting plans in motion, should Newsom and the Legislature move forward with an emergency election. It’s not easy, Page said, to prepare for something that may or may not happen. But there’s so much that goes into holding an election — vote centers must be secured, a list of those centers has to be printed for voters to consult, staff need to be hired and trained, among a bevy of other things on the election to-do list — that Page said he cannot afford to wait. “I have a responsibility to expend Orange County taxpayer resources efficiently and wisely,” Page told the OC Register. <a href="https://gvwire.com/2025/08/13/special-election-over-redistricting-could-cost-fresno-county-4-million-clerk-warns/">Fresno County</a> Clerk/Registrar of Voters James Kus said a tight deadline could push up costs. “My biggest concern is not the deadlines but the state paying for this election,” Kus said. He estimates it could cost the county $4 million to hold the election. </span></p>

Despite repeated efforts to move forward, the meeting was cut short before the members could discuss any agenda items. The cause of tension at the meeting arose over in-person vs. videoconference attendees and how many are required to establish a quorum, as the law and the board’s bylaws seemingly differ. While the bylaws include that district-based quorum language, the law does not. It only requires a majority of the 14 members to achieve a quorum. Things got so chaotic at the meeting that before the roll call, the stenographer, who was based on St. Thomas, interrupted the meeting. She expressed concern about her notes, stating she did not understand what was going on. “Other people are speaking,” she said. “This one is speaking, so I’m just letting you know for the record. So, when you all get the transcript, you know this is what it is.” </span><a href="https://viconsortium.com/vi-government/virgin-islands-board-of-elections-chair-cites-disrespect--disorder--and-rancor-as-obstacles-to--people-s-business-"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appearing before the Senate </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committee on Government Operations, Veterans Affairs, and Consumer Protection the next day, Board Chair Raymond Williams described a body plagued by dysfunction, breaches of protocol, and ongoing disputes that have stalled its ability to “do the people’s business.” Senate Committee Chair Senator Avery Lewis lamented the situation. “We can’t continue business like this. Each meeting is a cost to the people, whether it&#8217;s dollar value or informational value or getting the work done,” he said. Williams testified that rancor among members is an issue the board had “grown beyond” in previous years but has now resurfaced “for multiple reasons.” His goal, he emphasized, “is to get a working board to do the business of the people.”</span></p>

The town fixed the problem and is shelling out close to $4,000 to send a corrected mailer to all residents just days before final balloting. Town Manager Kerry Lafleur acknowledged that the offer to change votes feels novel. “I’ve been with the town for nine years,” she said. “I don’t remember anything like that in my time.”  Town Clerk Kaari Mai Tari confirmed in an email to The Concord Bridge: “This scenario has not come up in Concord before.” Concordians who have already voted via mail-in balloting or in-person absentee voting and want to change their vote based on new information can send a written request to have their vote spoiled and a new ballot mailed. Tari said 698 ballots had been cast as of August 12.</span></p>

							<h2>Ballot Measures, Legislation & Rulemaking</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3720" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Denver-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Denver, Colorado</strong>: Denver City Council on August 11 rejected a proposal to bring </span><a href="https://denverite.com/2025/08/12/denver-city-council-ranked-choice-fails/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Colorado’s largest city, but moved forward with another change to the city elections. The effort to bring ranked choice voting to Denver failed in a 6-7 vote. The proposal would have converted all races in Denver to a ranked choice model, with voters ranking up to six candidates for elected positions like mayor, council member and city clerk. If the council had approved the measure, it would have gone before Denver voters this November. Denver voters have shown some interest in ranked choice voting — it was one of the few counties where a majority of voters approved Prop. 131, an earlier statewide proposal for ranked choice voting. But with the council’s action on Monday, the measure will not appear on the ballot this November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3852" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Ohio</strong>: A pair of Democratic state lawmakers want to give voters the chance to </span><a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/08/13/ohio-democrats-propose-letting-voters-sign-up-to-always-use-absentee-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sign up for absentee ballots permanently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Eight states allow all their citizens to opt in to regular absentee voting, and another 11 allow specific populations like people with disabilities to do so, too. But under current law in Ohio, voters must file a new absentee ballot request with every single election. Ohio House Bill 400 would create several avenues for voters to sign up for the permanent absentee ballot list. The measure directs the Ohio Secretary of State to develop a new form for voters to add their name; voter registration, change of address and change of name forms would all get a new box allowing voter to opt in as well. Ditto the online voter registration portal. Finally, anytime a voter requests an absentee ballot for an individual election, they could also sign up for absentee ballots going forward. The proposal doesn’t direct county boards to send the actual ballot. Instead, voters would get the ballot request form. To get an actual ballot the voter has to return that form with identifying information including date of birth, social security number or driver’s license and their signature. “Folks who regularly vote by mail can voluntarily opt into being part of a system where they’re always going to get an application to vote by mail,” Rader explained. “So they don’t have to go seek that out every election. They don’t have to go find a form, or go online and request a form and remember to do that, put it on their calendar. So, it just kind of removes a step,” he added, “makes it a little bit easier for folks that prefer to vote by mail.”</span></p>

Bills to clarify election laws, address quorum contradictions and grant the Board of Elections final authority over the Supervisor of Elections remained in committee after they did not receive the necessary second motions by members of the Senate Committee on Government Operations, Veterans Affairs and Consumer Protection to move them forward during a hearing on August 8. Both measures, sponsored by Sen. Alma Francis Heyliger, proposed amendments to Title 18 of the Virgin Islands Code. Bill 36-0071 would have set a process for political parties to choose nominees for public office. Bill 36-0073 would have defined the powers of the Supervisor of Elections and the Board. At the hearing, Board of Elections Chairman Raymond Williams and Supervisor of Elections Caroline Fawkes urged lawmakers to modernize Title 18, which governs the territory’s election laws and has not been updated in more than 30 years. Bill 36-0073 would have codified that the Supervisor and Deputy Supervisor of Elections could appeal their removal to Superior Court, reaffirmed that there is a singular Board of Elections and given the Board explicit authority to overrule decisions of the Supervisor. After further discussion, both bills died in committee from lack of support.</span></p>

In Wisconsin, people who have served their criminal sentence for a felony, including incarceration and community service, parole, probation and extended supervision, are eligible to vote. But the proposed legislation would have required any outstanding requirements – “fines, costs, fees, surcharges, and restitution [and] any court-ordered community service, imposed in connection with the crime” – to be addressed in full before voting rights were fully restored. In vetoing the proposed legislation, Evers said, “This bill would create additional barriers to make it harder for individuals who have completed their sentences to have their right to vote restored. My promise to Wisconsinites has always been that I will not sign legislation that makes it harder for eligible Wisconsinites to cast their ballot. I will continue to keep that promise.”</span></p>

In a</span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.466734/gov.uscourts.flnd.466734.345.0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 55-page order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Walker found that the citizenship requirement in SB 7050, which GOP lawmakers pushed to passage in April 2023, violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause because it is “facially discriminatory with respect to alienage.” The decision blocks Florida from enforcing the provision against Humberto Orjuela Prieto, a Colombian-born permanent resident who works as a canvasser, and his employer, Latino civil rights and advocacy nonprofit UnidosUS, one of several plaintiffs in the case. But the injunction is narrowly tailored. Walker said, referencing the U.S. Supreme Court’s Trump v. CASA, Inc. decision in June, that he could not issue a statewide injunction, limiting relief to Orjuela Prieto and UnidosUS. The ruling still effectively blocks the state from penalizing those parties or their employees under the provision.</span></p>

Civil rights attorneys asked the three-judge panel to uphold a lower court’s ruling that relief activities, including handing out food and water, were a form of speech protected by the First Amendment. A state attorney argued the conduct was too vague to constitute a form of expression and authorities had an overwhelming interest in maintaining order at polling places. The panel also heard arguments on whether the state can require absentee voters to print their date of birth on the outer envelope of an absentee ballot. The Election Integrity Act of 2021, signed into law by Republican Governor Brian Kemp after the 2020 elections, enacted new voting restrictions that spanned from voter ID requirements to polling conduct. Multiple civil rights groups sued to block the law, claiming Georgia&#8217;s voting restrictions make it much harder for all Georgians to vote, particularly people of color, new citizens, and religious communities. U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee, a Donald Trump appointee, issued preliminary injunctions in 2023 blocking the law’s provisions related to line-relief activities and birthdates on absentee ballot envelopes. Citing Holloman v. Harland, Boulee found a reasonable person would interpret line-relief activities as expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment. Georgia Solicitor General Stephen J. Petrany argued at Wednesday’s hearing that a reasonable person would not assume that providing water bottles to voters was an activity fraught with deeper meaning. Expressive conduct requires symbolism, he argued, such as a raised fist or rude hand gesture. Even if line-relief activities qualified as expressive conduct, Georgia had the authority to limit speech near a polling place to protect the integrity of the voting process. “Georgia can decide that we don’t want voting to be a raucous event,” Petrany said.</span></p>

The October session will feature 10 arguments over five days, while the November session will feature nine over five days. Both sessions include important cases. On Oct. 15, the court will hear oral arguments in a Louisiana case that could limit the federal Voting Rights Act. When the court hears argument in</span><a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/louisiana-v-callais-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Louisiana v. Callais</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it will be the second round of arguments in the case, which comes to the court as a challenge to the congressional map that the Louisiana Legislature adopted in 2024. That map, which contained a second majority-Black district, followed a federal court’s ruling that a 2022 map, which contained only one majority-Black district, violated Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act, which prohibits election practices that result “in the denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.” A group of voters describing themselves as “non-African American” went to federal court, where they argued that the 2024 map was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander – that is, it relied too heavily on race.</span></p>

Gretchen Whitmer (D) of </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/michigan/2025/08/11/whitmer-sued-35th-district-state-senate-seat-open/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disenfranchising voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Michigan’s 35th state Senate district, arguing in a lawsuit that her refusal to call a special election for a long-vacant seat “undermines public trust … and erodes the legitimacy of enacted laws.” “In a democratic republic, the absence of representation is not a mere inconvenience — it is a denial of one of the most fundamental political rights,” attorney Philip Ellison, with Outside Legal Counsel, wrote in a</span><a href="https://olcplc.com/cases/35thDistrict/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suit filed Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Michigan Court of Claims on behalf of seven local residents. According to Votebeat, the complaint asks a judge to order Whitmer to call a special election within seven days. The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. The seat in the 35th Senate District has been vacant for the last seven months after Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet was elected to the U.S. House and officially left the Michigan Senate on Jan. 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muhtasin Sadman and Mohammed Hassan, two Hamtramck city council members, are facing </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/michigan/2025/08/11/hamtramck-city-council-election-forgery/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">felony charges that they forged signatures on absentee ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the city’s 2023 council race, according to new court filings, although it’s unclear how many ballots may have been manipulated. According to an April document that Attorney General Dana Nessel used to request a special prosecutor in the case, Sadman and Hassan, along with four others, “conspired to receive unvoted absentee ballots that had been signed by recently naturalized citizens, and to then fill in the candidates of their choosing” in the city’s 2023 election, the records say. They allegedly paid for votes “in order to gain an advantage in local elections,” the document said, and two other council members were also being investigated. Those council members, Abu Musa and Mohammed Alsomiri, have not been charged, according to court records.</span></p>

In a brief filed August 11, the RNC argued the justices should not review the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals’ ruling, which held that Mississippi’s five-day grace period for counting mail ballots postmarked by Election Day violates federal law. “The Fifth Circuit correctly held that the federal election day is the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials,” the RNC wrote. “A post-election receipt deadline for mail ballots extends ‘the election’ beyond the ‘day’ set by Congress.” Mississippi law previously allowed mail-in ballots to be counted if they arrive within five business days after the election, so long as they are postmarked on or before Election Day. Grace periods like this are often a safeguard for voters who rely on the mail service to vote — especially military, overseas and rural voters — ensuring that ballots mailed on time aren’t thrown out simply because of postal delays. The RNC, the Mississippi Republican Party and individual voters sued in 2024, claiming that extending the receipt deadline “dilutes the weight of timely, valid ballots” of voters who comply with the deadline.</span></p>

University student and facility IDs, if the state Board approves them, are among the acceptable forms of photo identification voters can use at the polls. Many campuses have replaced physical cards with multipurpose digital IDs. UNC’s was the first digital university ID the state Board approved. A trial court last year sided with the state Board, but the state Appeals Court blocked use of the mobile IDs. Students weren’t allowed to use them for the 2024 election. As part of the agreement dismissing the lawsuit, the state Board agreed to not approve any more digital IDs unless the legislature passes a law allowing them. Democrats held a 3-2 majority on the elections board last year. Republicans now have a majority.</span></p>

Six of the 15 suspects, who were indicted in May, entered not guilty pleas earlier this year. The other nine, who were indicted in June, officially pled not guilty in court this week. Because other judges in the county excused themselves from the case, it was presided by state Judge Sid Harle of the 4th Administrative Judicial Region via Zoom. The 4th Administrative Judicial Region spans 22 counties, including Frio. </span></p>
