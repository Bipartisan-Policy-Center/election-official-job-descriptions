							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Welcome to 2025</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Center has big plans for the coming year</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Kathleen Hale, executive director</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Center</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Center</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> starts to roll out its big plans for 2025, it is an understatement to point out that 2024 was full of challenges for the field of election administration. Floods, fires, and other natural disasters collided with a highly contested presidential election season. However, it was also full of success! And yet, operations were, for the most part, unremarkable. Practices and procedures were held, poll workers were trained, <img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12181" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-11-at-2.49.34 PM-300x132.png" alt="" width="300" height="132" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-11-at-2.49.34 PM-300x132.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-11-at-2.49.34 PM.png 354w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />ballots were mailed, training was effective, and equipment ran as intended. The work put in years ago paid forward to a smooth civic experience. As readers of this space know well electionline has been working long hours to keep us all up on the avalanche of news about all of this and more!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Election Center has been hard at work paying forward on its infrastructure with a new website [Coming very soon!] and member relationship software to enhance its foundation for networking and learning and continue building the professional community we all depend upon. A signature piece of the infrastructure modernization effort, designed and led by Tammy Patrick, Chief Program Officer, established the Election Center’s online presence as a state-of-the-art membership organization. Thanks to the tieless attention of Karla Hooter and the rest of the Election Center staff you can expect to be able to communicate with other members through your account, share information about your interests, join and form committees and working groups, register for events, including CERA and REO certification sessions, and monitor your progress. We hope you like the new look and feel of our operation. We will be tweaking it regularly in the weeks to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9913" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal-230x300.png" alt="" width="230" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal-230x300.png 230w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal-784x1024.png 784w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal-768x1003.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Journal.png 836w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" />The Journal of Election Administration Research &amp; Practice, the signature publication of the Election Center’s Institute for Election Administration, Research and Practice in its partnership with Auburn University, is leading the year with the release of Vol. III, Issue 1, and a special issue edited by Dr. Charles Stewart III, the Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Political Science at MIT. The special issue presents a collection of research by leaders in the field about today’s most pressing questions in administration and practice. We hope you will look at both issues when available (through the new website!), and please reach out if you have ideas for articles or research or want to serve as a reviewer of these or other ideas important to the election administration community. Also, as part of our focus on public trust and related issues brewing in the field, we published revised Standards of Conduct for Election Officials, which we released at a national press event at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In training and certification, new opportunities are forthcoming with the Election Center’s REO (Registered Election Official) state-level training series currently active in California, Idaho, and Texas. Completing these can be linked to credit in the national CERA certification program. Alongside REO training, the Election Center is investing in modernizing and supporting state association efforts—these also have links to credit in the CERA program. A CERA Advisory Board has been established to engage members further on certification efforts and give us even more input from the field. In 2024, we piloted a course with a co-instructor team of Auburn faculty and practitioner instructors. These co-instructor sessions will expand throughout 2025 and beyond as we strive to meet the field by further blending excellence in practice with academic principles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upcoming this year, we are continuing to respond to member interest in experiencing a variety of content and formats with refreshed design for the workshops and a plan to spread this content across the year. The February workshop [in Little Rock, Arkansas Feb. 26-28.] will focus on the people’s choice awards for innovations across the election environment and feature presentations by award winners as well as your opportunity to engage in discussion on the ideas you want to learn more about; the April workshop [in Pittsburgh, April 23-25] will take a deep dive into the world of state associations that interact with the election space. This dimension is essential as it continues to grow and mature across the country. Best practices will be discussed, and a guidebook for forming or enhancing an association will be featured. In October 2025, Auburn University will once again host its Symposium on Election Administration Research &amp; Practice and which will focus on best practices and innovative ideas in funding elections.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a personal note, I am wrapping up my first few months as Executive Director of Election Center. It is a privilege to bring my work with nonprofit organizations of all types to this field. Creating a Graduate Certificate in Nonprofit Organizations &amp; Community Governance for Auburn University and leading Auburn’s collaboration with the Election Center in the CERA program have led me to this place. I have the distinct honor to work with a fantastic team on the Election Center staff and with Auburn’s leadership team. Although we have not been conducting elections this year, we have been working to provide more and better service to bring value to being an Election Center member. We will release our first Annual Report in 2025 as part of our efforts to emerge as a mature nonprofit after 40 years of running a lean shop with fewer than a handful of staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, we are looking forward to a great year ahead! If you are not yet a member and are engaged in election administration, please consider joining us. If you have an established connection to the field, this is the place for you. I invite your comments and questions and hope to see you at an event or training session soon!</span></p>

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12267" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/APPoll01.25-300x147.png" alt="" width="300" height="147" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/APPoll01.25-300x147.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/APPoll01.25-1024x500.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/APPoll01.25-768x375.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/APPoll01.25-1536x750.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/APPoll01.25.png 1740w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Public Opinion</strong>: According to a new poll from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs,</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-election-security-republicans-trump-ap-poll-6171a25bd64dbb47505b8c907ddcb037"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a majority of Republicans say they are confident in the 2024 vote count</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after Donald Trump’s win. About 6 in 10 Republicans said they have “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of confidence that the votes in last year’s presidential election were counted correctly nationwide, according to the poll. That’s a sharp rise from about 2 in 10 Republicans who were confident in an</span><a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/voters-have-more-confidence-in-an-accurate-vote-count-in-their-own-state-or-locality-than-nationwide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AP-NORC poll in October</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And about two-thirds of Republicans in the new survey said they were confident in their state’s vote count, up from about 4 in 10 before the election. That helped drive up the share of Americans saying they have “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of confidence in the accuracy of the election to about 6 in 10. That’s higher than in October, when roughly half of Americans said they were highly confident the votes would be counted accurately. Threats toward local election officials soared after 2020, leading to a wave of veteran administrators leaving office. In a potential sign that those hostilities might ease, the poll found that about 7 in 10 Americans have “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of confidence that votes in the 2024 presidential election were counted accurately by their local election officials, up from about 6 in 10 in October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-7925" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WIdropbox-244x300.png" alt="" width="186" height="229" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WIdropbox-244x300.png 244w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WIdropbox.png 614w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" />Uncounted Ballot Investigation</strong>: The Wisconsin Elections Commission unanimously authorized an investigation into Madison’s mishandling of nearly 200 absentee ballots from the November 2024 election that were never counted. According to Votebeat, it’s the first such investigation that the bipartisan commission has authorized since becoming an agency in 2016. The review will allow the agency to probe whether Madison Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl violated the law or abused her discretion. Democratic Commissioner Ann Jacobs told Votebeat that her priority wasn’t “punishment” but to figure out “what on earth went wrong here.” “Our lack of knowledge, information that wasn’t given to us in a timely fashion, I think we need to do something more formal,” Jacobs said at the meeting. The late discovery that 193 absentee ballots from voters in the state capital weren’t counted appears to have resulted from mistakes at two separate polling locations and the lack of a comprehensive system for poll workers to track whether they’ve counted every absentee ballot. The city’s election results were certified without any acknowledgment of the 193 missing ballots. Some of the missing ballots were discovered on Nov. 12, as the county canvass was still going on, though most weren’t found until nearly a month after Election Day. “My issue is not with the magnitude,” GOP Commissioner Don Millis said. “While the magnitude is significant, the issue is why was this not determined or caught by the time of either the local canvass or county canvass.”</span></p>

For his fourth swearing-in, ceremonies were held at Hillsborough Academy of Math and Science. In addition to the swearing-in ceremonies, Latimer was on hand to teach a civics lesson to 8th graders. “This is Civics 101,&#8221; Latimer told Spectrum News. &#8220;We’re going to show these students what it is to be sworn in when you’re elected to office, and the responsibilities that you have.&#8221; Hillsborough County Judge Daryl Manning presided over the ceremony and explained to students what it means to take an oath. “That’s an oath, that’s what people take, so you can be responsible, not only to yourself, but to the person sitting to the left and the right of you,” he said. And making the day even more special for Latimer, his grandson, Keaton, held the Bible for the swearing in ceremony.  Keaton is a student at the school, and while he’s always been a part of his grandfather’s swearing in ceremonies, it was his idea to bring the ceremony to his school, and with a little help from his teacher, he made it happen. “My history teacher is the one who helped us be able to do all this, so he was very excited about it because I’ve told him before, you know my grandfather is the supervisor of elections, he’s my civics and my world history teacher, so he loved the idea about that,” said Keaton. Latimer said sharing this memory with his grandson, and his fellow students, made it one of his most special ceremonies, and he hopes seeing civics in action inspires students to get involved as adults. Latimer was first elected to his position in November 2012, and was re-elected in 2016, 2020, and 2024.</span></p>

Programs are judged on creativity and innovation, cost-effectiveness, replicability, and impact by a committee of peers. Any program used in an election can be submitted for consideration, and election jurisdictions of all sizes are encouraged to participate. The Clearies are just one way the EAC advances its mission to be a source of election administration best practices and showcase outstanding programs that other election offices may implement to better serve voters.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&#8217;s Mark Niesse has a </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/president-carter-leaves-legacy-of-global-election-monitoring-and-transparency/7D6RBYROFBE5FHJIKJV3WRN4UU/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nice write-up about President Carter’s lasting legacy of global election monitoring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and transparency. The Carter Center’s election monitoring work started in 1989 with missions to Central American nations and later expanded within the United States after the 2020 election. Carter saw a need for greater accountability through election observation efforts to help ensure the results reflect the will of the voters, David Carroll, director for the Carter Center’s Democracy Program told the AJC. “It’s a critical way to have leaders that can be recognized as genuinely democratically elected,” Carroll said. “Those can be really divisive issues, and we’re helping to make it a more transparent process so that all sides can have confidence in the results.” The Carter Center has observed 125 elections in 40 countries and three Native American nations. Carter led the Commission on Federal Election Reform with former Republican Secretary of State James Baker, which recommended more professional oversight of elections, stronger controls on absentee ballots to reduce the possibility of voter fraud, increased voter registration and photo ID. “It’s hard to imagine anyone who is a greater evangelist for democracy,” said David Becker, executive director for the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, an organization that works with election officials to improve voter confidence. “He did the hard work of the nuts and bolts of democracy. He made sure it actually works and gives voters’ confidence that their vote had meaning.” After the 2020 election, Carter spoke out against Georgia’s elections overhaul law. “We must not promote confidence among one segment of the electorate by restricting the participation of others,” Carter said in 2021. “Our goal always should be to increase, not decrease, voter participation.” Since 2020, the Carter Center has expanded its observation efforts to include areas within the United States.</span></p>

Wayne Long, R-Bradford, filed a bill that would </span><a href="https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2025/jan/08/bill-seeks-to-make-every-legislative-race-winner/?news"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require candidates to win a majority of votes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to be elected to the state Legislature. The legislation, House Bill 1078, would undo Arkansas&#8217; first-past-the-post voting system for state legislative races, where candidates have to win only a plurality of votes in order to win office. The system Long proposed through legislation requires a candidate to win more than 50% of the vote before being declared the winner. In a contest with three or more candidates in which none win an outright majority in the general election, the top two vote-getters would again face off in a runoff election four weeks later under Long&#8217;s bill. If the runoff election ends with the candidates being tied, then &#8220;the State Board of Election Commissioners shall determine the winner of the special runoff election by lot at an open public meeting.&#8221;</span></p>

Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, introduced a bill in the House State Affairs Committee this week to amend Idaho’s law related to the </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/briefs/idaho-representative-introduces-bill-to-raise-voting-threshold-to-60-for-ballot-initiatives/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voting threshold for statewide ballot initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and referendums. Idaho Code currently states that “no measure shall be adopted unless it shall receive an affirmative majority of the aggregate number of votes cast on such measure.” This means an initiative or referendum can pass so long as it receives 50% of the vote plus one. Skaug’s bill proposes to change that language, increasing the threshold to at least 60% of votes. The bill so far has 11 legislative co-sponsors in the Idaho House and Senate. The committee voted to move the bill forward, clearing the way for a full public hearing at a later date. Rep. Todd Achilles, D-Boise, said he has concerns he wants Skaug to address moving forward, pointing out that the Idaho Supreme Court in 2021 ruled that initiatives are a fundamental right to Idahoans. “We’re putting a 60% threshold on citizens, on Idaho citizens, when we as legislators only have a 50% threshold, so I think we have to justify that more clearly,” he said.</span></p>

In addition to including language to require identification at the time of voting, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows explained that it also changes other aspects of Maine elections including absentee voting and the process to challenge a ballot. And because it is a citizen’s initiative, Bellows said the text of the petition has to go to voters as is. It can’t be amended before appearing on the ballot.  Though Bellows said “reasonable people can agree to disagree” on the policy of showing identification at the time of voting, she is concerned by the other aspects of the proposal. Bellows said the petition would politicize the election process. Currently, municipal clerks — which is not a partisan position — are responsible for collecting the content of absentee ballot drop boxes. The petition seeks to change that to a “bipartisan team of election officials.” Details on how those teams would be decided and formed are not outlined in the petition. Bellows also said the proposal would make absentee voting harder, such as by repealing the provision allowing immediate family members to drop off ballots for each other. It also wants to roll back ongoing absentee voting, which allows voters to have absentee ballots mailed to them automatically for each election cycle. This option was implemented last February for voters over the age of 65 who self-identify as having a disability. Additionally, the petition would remove the option for municipalities to get approval for multiple ballot drop boxes, instead requiring them to only have one.  The petition also seeks to change the process for challenging someone’s right to vote. Under current law, it is up to a challenger to prove that someone doesn’t have the right to vote in a certain election. Challenged voters may still cast a ballot, but it is marked as being challenged so that it can be reviewed in the event of a close race. The petition wants to shift the burden of proof onto the person who is being challenged, Bellows explained.</span></p>

Maura Healy has signed legislation into law that will </span><a href="https://www.masslive.com/westernmass/2025/01/amid-a-flurry-of-bills-a-provision-for-recall-elections-in-granby.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allow the city of Granby to hold recall elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The provision, a home rule petition, was introduced by state Sen. Jacob R. Oliveira and state Reps. Daniel R. Carey and Mindy Domb in 2023. A person connected to the Granby clerk’s office said the bill was introduced via a petition by town residents over a potential future need and not because of any pressing need to recall any town official. The legislation establishes a framework for initiating recall petitions in Granby. To initiate a petition, 100 or more registered voters must file an affidavit with the town clerk, according to the text of the legislation. If the petition is signed by at least a quarter of the town’s registered voters, the Granby Selectboard must call for a recall election. There are about 5,192 registered voters in the town, according to data kept by the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s Office. The bill specifies grounds for recall, including conviction of a felony or ethical violations.

State Question 835 has been refiled as State Question 836. The new wording clarifies that the constitutional provisions do not impact the selection of presidential electors and ensures that the initiative only addresses the process for partisan primary elections at the state, county and federal levels. Presidential elections would be unaffected. The new language also clarifies that candidates will appear on the ballot identified by party registration. The old language used the term “affiliation.” Under the proposal, Oklahoma primaries would be open to all voters with the top two vote getters advancing to the general election. Voters would only be able to choose one candidate for each office. Supporters need 172,993 signatures to get the measure on the ballot. They are hoping to get it on the November 2026 ballot. “We are refiling our initiative petition out of an abundance of caution,” said Robert McCampbell, an attorney for petition supporters. “While SQ 835 was clear and legally sound, we don’t want to allow (an) opportunity for misinterpretation that could overshadow the real purpose of this initiative – ensuring every voter in Oklahoma has a voice in our elections.”</span></p>

In an interview with ABC4.com, Dunnigan says the change is important as the population grows. “Utah is growing, our population is growing, so we are going to allow a precinct to have up to 3,000 voters,” Dunnigan explained while speaking of his bill. “It doesn’t mean they will have 3,000, but they can have that many.” According to current law, when precincts reach 1,250 voters, county clerks are required to split those precincts. Regardless of whether those two new precincts are voting in the same elections. The last time that cap was increased was in 2006. Though the bill has been written and introduced, it still has to go through the legislative process. It will need to pass committee votes and go through each chamber of the state’s legislature before being sent to the Governor for signing.</span></p>

State Sen. Barbara Favola (D-40) has introduced legislation that would eliminate the automatic stripping of voting rights of those who come under a guardianship. Prefiled in December, Favola’s</span><a href="https://lis.blob.core.windows.net/files/1011742.PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 765</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been referred to the Senate Committee on Rehabilitation and Social Services. It should receive a sympathetic hearing there, as Favola chairs that committee. Favola’s bill, if passed, would require courts to determine if an individual covered by a guardianship or conservatorship has an interest in voting, and only remove voting rights after a formal determination is made on the matter. “Moreover, my bill would prohibit the use of ‘poll test’ questions and would require that the court provide an individual with access to appropriate accommodations, if such accommodations are necessary for the individual to communicate their interest in voting,” Favola told FFXnow. Virginia law allows courts to appoint a guardian or conservator for adults who have been found “mentally incompetent,” meaning they’re unable to process information effectively to the point where they need assistance to address their own health and safety needs and to manage finances.</span></p>

The state implemented voter ID laws fully for the first time in 2016, requiring voters to show a valid photo ID when casting their ballots. Republican lawmakers said they want to add it to the state constitution to make it harder to repeal the requirement and harder for the state Supreme Court to overrule the law. With the measure added to the constitution, it would take another constitutional amendment to remove it. Republicans on the Senate Judiciary and Public Safety Committee passed the measure January 7, despite Democrats complaining that it was being rushed through, is redundant given current state law and that voter ID laws are harmful.  The Senate <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/wi/milwaukee/news/2025/01/08/senate-passes-voter-id-constitutional-amendment">approved the measure</a> as a whole this week, so it can then be sent to the Assembly in time for it to be placed on the April ballot. To protect voter ID requirements, Republicans’ proposal would add language in the state constitution requiring that to vote, a qualified elector in any election must first present a photo ID issued by the state, by the federal government, by a federally recognized American Indian tribe or band, or by a college or university in Wisconsin. The amendment would require acceptable forms of ID to be specified in law, authorize lawmakers to pass laws establishing exceptions to the photo ID requirement and require that a person unable to present valid ID before voting on Election Day must be given the opportunity to cast a provisional ballot and present a valid photo ID at a later time and place.  To enact a constitutional amendment, lawmakers must pass identically worded proposals in two consecutive legislative sessions before sending it to voters, who decide whether to ratify the change. Republicans passed the proposal the first time in November 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Tony Evers (D) is proposing that the Legislature </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/01/06/gov-evers-wants-to-let-wisconsin-voters-propose-statewide-ballot-measures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a way for Wisconsin residents to directly create ballot measures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that make statutory and constitutional changes through the referendum process. Evers’ proposal for a “binding referendum” process would allow citizens to put proposed measures before the electorate for ratification.  Wisconsin law currently permits the Legislature to place proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot, after they pass two consecutive legislative sessions. But Wisconsin doesn’t have a way for voters themselves to introduce initiatives or place a binding referendum on the statewide ballot. Republican lawmakers have turned to constitutional amendments in recent years as a way to  bypass the governor’s veto pen. Evers said that if Republicans are going to continue to utilize that process, Wisconsin citizens should also have the opportunity to place questions on the ballot. “If Republican lawmakers are going to continue to try to legislate by constitutional amendment, then they should give Wisconsinites the same opportunities that 26 other states have,” Evers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election officials are considering t</span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/wisconsin/2025/01/06/absentee-ballot-counting-delays-early-voting-preprocessing-laws/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wo strategies to change how quickly ballots are counted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Both would require approval in the majority-Republican Legislature. At least one of them is highly likely to get signed into law in 2025. One proposed measure would significantly simplify early in-person voting procedures. Currently, people who vote early in person receive and fill out absentee ballots, which get set aside in envelopes and aren’t processed or tabulated until election day. The proposal clerks are considering, which is similar to a measure that received some legislative support several years ago, would allow early voters instead to put their ballots right into a tabulator. The other measure, which has been repeatedly pitched and then rejected in one or both legislative chambers, would allow election officials to get a one-day head start and begin processing absentee ballots on the Monday before the election. This past session, the proposal passed the Assembly but stalled in the Senate.</span></p>

Manasco issued a Dec. 27 order  to stay the case, which stems from Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen’s efforts to remove alleged noncitizens from the voter rolls ahead of the 2024 general election, which affected 3,251 voters. “Despite their disagreement over the reason that a stay of proceedings is appropriate, both private plaintiffs and the state defendants agree as to the outcome,” both parties stated in the request for a stay. The plaintiffs, including the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice and the League of Women Voters of Alabama, claim that the program disproportionately targeted naturalized citizens and violated federal election law deadlines. Parties had different reasons for seeking the pause. State officials said in the filing that a “different, as yet undesigned, process in 2025” could render some claims potentially moot, with the yet-to-be-redesigned process addressing data accuracy and issues raised in the lawsuit. Plaintiffs said they hope to negotiate a settlement while maintaining their objections to certain procedural delays​. Due to these potential changes, “private plaintiffs believe that a stay of proceedings in light of potential partial or full settlement resolution is the best path forward.”</span></p>

In spring 2020, state prosecutors accused LeDoux of illegally encouraging people who lived outside her district to cast votes within the district. Some charges were dismissed, but LeDoux faced five felony charges and seven misdemeanor charges this year. Her case was repeatedly postponed and reached trial in November, more than four years after initial charges were filed. After a week of court arguments, jurors split for and against LeDoux’s guilt, and Judge Kevin Saxby declared a mistrial.Saxby set Feb. 3 as the date of the next hearing between the two sides.</span></p>

Superior Court Judge John Pridgen ordered the new election for Ben Hill County Board of Education this week because the race was left off the ballot for 88 voters. The race was decided by just 29 votes. After last May’s school board election in Ben Hill County, a judge threw out the results because 26 voters who live on the same street were given ballots for the wrong district. Then in the second election in November, election officials inadvertently excluded eligible voters when they updated registration records before Election Day. Pridgen’s order for a new election attributed the problem to an analyst for the secretary of state’s office who reviewed voter registration records the weekend before the election. Both candidates said the Ben Hill County elections office is ultimately responsible for ensuring voters receive the correct ballots. Ben Hill Elections Supervisor Rachel Roberts declined to explain what went wrong and referred questions to the county attorney, Nicholas Kinsley, who didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. “I’m not certain (what happened),” Roberts told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “I just know we have to rerun it.”</span></p>

Liman ruled after hearing Giuliani testify for a second day at a contempt hearing called after lawyers for the election workers said the former New York City mayor had failed to properly comply with requests for evidence over the last few months. Liman said Giuliani “willfully violated a clear and unambiguous order of this court” when he “blew past” a Dec. 20 deadline to turn over evidence that would help the judge decide at a trial later this month whether Giuliani can keep a Palm Beach, Florida, condominium as his residence or must turn it over because it is deemed a vacation home.</span></p>

Tim Walz’s decision to hold a special election </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan. 28 for a DFL-held House seat. The legal challenge is among the unsettled issues that will determine which party controls the Legislature in the 2025 session. The GOP petition seeks to delay the special election — and prolong the party’s advantage. Regardless of when the election occurs, the DFL is heavily favored to retain control of the seat, returning the House to a 67-67 tie. The GOP petition claimed Walz prematurely called the special election before the seat was vacant because incumbent Rep. Jamie Becker-Finn, DFL-Roseville, remains in office. The 33-page GOP and Voters Alliance petition said Johnson can’t “resign” from a seat he was ineligible to hold. In a statement, Walz’s office defended his action. It said state law requires the governor to call a special election “as soon as possible”. The GOP petition called Walz’s order rushed, unlawful and premature. “Petitioners have found no other example in any special election in the history of Minnesota with similar facts and such an impetuous timeline,” it said. The Supreme Court has yet to act on the petition, which was announced Saturday. The court could reject it outright or request written briefs and schedule oral arguments.</span></p>

Jefferson Griffin, a North Carolina court of appeals judge, challenged the results of his race for a Supreme Court seat against Supreme Court Associate Justice Allison Riggs after she secured a lead over him more than a week after the election. This is his first win in several legal challenges he has filed over the race, protesting the processing timeline and claiming that the state is counting ballots he considers to be unlawfully cast. Myers found that Griffin&#8217;s challenges do not raise an issue of federal law, and remanded the merits of Griffin’s request to the Supreme Court. “Should a federal tribunal resolve such a dispute?” Myers, a Donald Trump appointee, wrote in his order. “This court, with due regard for state sovereignty and the independence of states to decide matters of substantial public concern, thinks not.”  Griffin originally asked the state Supreme Court to intervene and keep the state board of elections from counting the disputed ballots and prevent it from certifying the election. Attorneys for the elections board moved the case to federal court, but Griffin is expected to have a much higher chance of success with his arguments now that they have returned to the Supreme Court, where Republicans hold a 5-2 majority.   The challenge raises unsettled questions over state constitutional and statutory law, Myers said, that the court is choosing to abstain from deciding. “The court ends as it began: a sitting state court judge seeks a writ of prohibition (a form of judicial relief authorized by the state constitution) from the state supreme court that would enjoin the state board of elections from counting votes for a state election contest that were cast by voters in a manner allegedly inconsistent with state law,” Myers said. Riggs — who was appointed to the court in 2023 by former Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat — has said that she plans to recuse herself from the case if the state Supreme Court hears it. She has announced her win, but Griffin has not conceded the race. On January 7, the state Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/north-carolina-supreme-court-halts-election-certification-in-associate-justice-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">halted the election certification process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, granting Griffin a temporary stay while legal proceedings in his challenge to ballots cast in the race are pending.</span></p>

It details that despite the population of Hazleton being 40% Hispanic voting-age citizens, Hispanic-preferred candidates run and routinely lose.  The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, alleges that changing the method of election can allow Hispanic voters to elect candidates of their choice to the city&#8217;s council. &#8220;The Justice Department is committed to ensuring that all citizens have an equal opportunity to participate in the democratic process and elect candidates of choice.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of candidates who fell short of winning seats on the city’s school board and commission, against the Washington County Election Commission. “The plaintiffs’ complaint cannot be sustained,” Rambo said during a lengthy explanation of his decision. The complaint, filed and argued by plaintiffs Jay Emberton (a city commission candidate) and Ryan Berkley, Zaire Gary and Sam Pettyjohn (school board candidates) stemmed mainly from a mistake in Carter County’s administration of ballots in the Johnson City election. At least some Heather Lane voters — up to 44 — were given Johnson City election ballots even though that street is not inside the city limits. Joe Wise defeated Aaron Murphy by 38 votes overall. While he didn’t spare the Carter County Election Commission from criticism, Rambo said the plaintiffs didn’t claim fraud, and the mistake appeared to be an honest one. “Voiding an election is a drastic remedy,” he said. Lawyers for the Washington County Election Commission filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in December. They argued that the six votes at issue in Washington County weren’t enough to tip the election, and that because Murphy wasn’t a plaintiff, the three unsuccessful school board candidates and Emberton, who finished out of the running in the City Commission election, didn’t have standing. “It is not the responsibility and it is not proper for a judge to void an election due to mistakes being made that do not change the results of the election for the parties who are before the court,” Rambo said. Citing a section of Tennessee law on elections, Rambo said it “would require Aaron Murphy to be a party.”</span></p>

A month before election day last year, two of Waynesboro&#8217;s three electoral board members sued state election officials over how Virginia uses ballot-counting machines, refusing to certify the results under current procedure. In response, five local voters sued them. Judge Paul A. Dryer ordered the board members – Curtis Lilly II and Scott Mares – to certify the city&#8217;s election results, which they ultimately did. Dryer wrote in an opinion letter that their concerns would be best raised via the legislative process, and &#8220;the personal beliefs of a local board of elections cannot derail the election process for the entire commonwealth.&#8221; Since then, the electoral board members&#8217; attorney filed to voluntarily drop their lawsuit against the state officials. But they&#8217;ve appealed the court order that made them sign off on the 2024 results. The Court of Appeals of Virginia has not yet indicated when they&#8217;ll review the case. Ranieri said in an email that they&#8217;re going to &#8220;make some adjustments to the original case theory&#8221; before bringing that back to the courts.</span></p>
