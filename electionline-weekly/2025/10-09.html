							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pipelines to Election Work</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who becomes an election official</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Paul Manson and Paul Gronke (</span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections &amp; Voting Information Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and TJ Pyche (</span><a href="https://electionsgroup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Elections Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election administration is in the midst of another structural shift – and this time, the change requires assessing how best <img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png" alt="" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-300x171.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice.png 576w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />to recruit and retain talent in election administration. </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/evic-news/pipelines-to-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a new analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we argue that the field must be treated as a skilled profession with clear career pathways, competitive compensation, and multiple on-ramps that preserve and grow expertise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Past moments of rapid change, such as the 2000 election cycle and the passage of the Help America Vote Act, shaped how jurisdictions register voters, deploy certified voting systems, and run early and absentee voting. Offices responded by retraining and expanding staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s challenge looks different: election work has become more technical, more visible, and less forgiving of error. With immovable deadlines and no “do-overs,” success depends on deep, specialized knowledge across logistics, IT, communications, and compliance, both among chief election officials and the larger workforce that rarely reaches the top job. New skills are also expected in this era, from voter education to public relations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EVIC’s </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/leo_survey_project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local Election Official Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows how varied the role can be for chief local election officials. Some officials are solo practitioners, while others manage large, complex teams ranging in size from a dozen to hundreds or more.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What this means is that focusing only on the leader of the organization gives us only the first note of the song. In large jurisdictions, especially, many career election professionals are technical specialists whose skills are in demand elsewhere in government and the private sector – making retention a growing concern. We argue in our analysis that we need to learn much more about the rest of the election workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pathways into the profession are diverse and often depend on jurisdiction size and the manner in which officials are selected for the role. In </span><a href="https://evic.reed.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/codebook.html#Career_Trajectory,_Workload,_Staff_Size"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the 2022 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 57% of LEOs were elected, 27% appointed, and 15% hired into positions with civil service protections. Hired LEOs most often come from other local government roles (43%), with a significant share from private business (32%). For elected and appointed LEOs, the pattern flips: approximately 41% arrive from the private sector and about a quarter from local government. In smaller, often rural offices, the pool of government jobs is thinner and the “ladder” is short. In those offices, officials wear many hats beyond elections (budgets, licensing, tax reporting, even 911 oversight), leaving limited room for specialization or advancement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These results point to a big gap in current knowledge. We need to learn much more to be effective in crafting workforce development policy. Even with EVIC’s surveys, we lack long-term measures and an understanding of staff-level roles and trajectories. Without a clearer picture of how people enter, advance, and exit the profession, it will be harder to design effective recruitment and retention strategies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We propose a practical agenda to strengthen the election workforce:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collect more and better longitudinal data on who enters, stays, and leaves (and why).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Map internal progression paths, even in small offices, with titles, mentorship, and step increases tied to election-specific skills.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build external entry points through fellowships and internships with universities and community colleges.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update job classifications and compensation to match the work’s complexity and make invisible skills visible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell the profession’s story to attract mission-driven talent.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversify on-ramps while protecting institutional knowledge via certifications, boot camps, and rotational programs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bottom line: The election workforce is resilient, but resilience shouldn’t require constant personal sacrifice. Read the full blog post for the data, tables, and detailed recommendations.</span></p>

According to Votebeat, the visit was coordinated by Project for Election Infrastructure, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on advocating for funding for state and local election administration, and that has been urging Congress to appropriate $400 million for election security in fiscal year 2026. “Every county clerk and election official probably has a different idea and a different need for what funding they&#8217;d have for those infrastructure dollars,” said </span><a href="https://www.wqad.com/article/news/local/the-current/knox-county-clerk-scott-erikson-election-funding-national-infrastructure-congress-travel-washington/526-9ee57506-4c1a-4371-8b6e-15115b5ab37f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox County, Illinois</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clerk and Recorder of Deeds Scott Erickson . “A lot of it is cybersecurity funding to maintain our products, and for equipment. We just bought new voting machines for the first time in 20 years.” While the officials met mostly with staff, some, like those from Maryland, did get to speak directly to representatives from their state.  “They are all acknowledging the need,” said Brian Sleeth, the director of elections in Warren County, Ohio, after a morning of meetings on the House side. Tonya Wichman, director of elections in Defiance County, Ohio, said part of the goal is making sure members understand what election officials do and what they need in order to do it. “The standards are set so high,” she said. The House put $15 million in election infrastructure funding in an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2026, but it remains to be seen what Congress will eventually do</span></p>

The changes that would become effective next year is currently failing with 52.6% NO and 47.4% YES. However, Proposition 5 that would move the borough&#8217;s election date to November to align with state and federal elections is currently passing 64.4% YES to 35.6% NO.  </span></p>

Civic Nation 2030 aims to respond to the urgent needs of the current moment while building the foundations for a better future. “From the COVID-19 pandemic and loneliness epidemic to the rise of social media and AI, Americans have begun to not only lose faith in democracy, but in each other. We can, and must, rebuild trust from the ground up to reverse the cycle of civic unraveling we find ourselves in. There is no easy solution to our country’s issues, but together, we can face this urgent challenge head on and create a more civic nation,” said Civic Nation CEO Kyle Lierman. The majority of Americans no longer believe democracy is working and many are opting out of the process as a result. In 2024, one in three eligible voters and more than half of young people ages 18–29 did not cast a ballot, and only 28% of people over the age of 16 formally volunteered in their communities. Over the next five years, Civic Nation will engage 20 million Americans to take action, solve problems and help their communities thrive. As an impact hub for ideas, leaders and initiatives, Civic Nation is home to: ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge: Empowering colleges and universities to achieve excellence in nonpartisan student democratic engagement. Change Collective: Building a new national community of local changemakers to drive change, solve problems and bridge divides. It&#8217;s On Us: Building the movement to combat campus sexual assault by giving students the tools they need to create a culture of prevention. We The Action: Uniting lawyers with nonprofits to expand access to justice and deliver free legal services where they are critically needed. When We All Vote: Increasing civic participation in each and every election to close the race and age voting gap and change the culture around voting.</span></p>

The national institute’s awards honor the states, cities, counties, and agencies delivering more accessible, equitable, and engaging digital services. VoteIdaho.gov was recognized as an outstanding example of how technology and design can improve the way residents experience government. “We’re honored to receive national recognition for VoteIdaho.gov, along with our design partner, Mitchell+Palmer,” said Secretary of State Phil McGrane. “Our goal with the redesign of VoteIdaho.gov was simple – to make voting information engaging, accessible, and easy to consume for all Idahoans. We’re continuing to build on the features that make the website stand out. I encourage all Idahoans to visit the site to easily register to vote, check and update your registration, view a sample ballot for the upcoming November election, find your polling place, and much more.” The Government Experience Project Awards honor digital initiatives that make it easier for residents to connect with the government. This year, 41 governments nationwide were recognized for innovation, creativity, and a commitment to better public service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4535" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Michael_Adams-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Congratulations Part II:</strong> Governing Magazine has named </span><a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ky/louisville/news/2025/10/08/kentucky-secretary-of-state"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Public Official of the Year, one of seven nationally. According to a release from Adams’ office, each year, Governing honors state and local leaders on both sides of the aisle who have accomplished significant changes for those they serve. The publication, which covers policy and management in state and local government, commends Adams’ balance of handling election security and ballot access concerns in executing bipartisan voting reforms that began with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. “It took a major crisis just to compel Kentucky to catch up with what the rest of the country had been doing for a long time, which is making it easier for people to vote,” Adams told the Herald-Leader. “Unfortunately, we’ve chosen to be a backwater for a long time and not keep up with current trends, and it took local crises being managed well to improve our standing.”  It’s Adams’ second national recognition, after the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation presented him with the JFK Profile in Courage Award in 2024.  Now in his second term as secretary of state, the graduate of Harvard Law School was elected in 2019. He has worked to expand early voting in the commonwealth and has pushed back against false claims about rigged elections as the state’s chief election officer. “When people look at Washington and see dysfunction and the federal government literally not working, this is a great reminder that there is another way: toning down the rhetoric and working together to solve our biggest challenges,” Adams said.</span></p>

The new report addresses structural barriers that contribute to this gap and emphasizes an urgent need for state policymakers to expand access to ensure eligible voters without a driver’s license can participate in democracy. Since most states rely on DMV records and transactions to facilitate voter-friendly registration methods such as online voter registration and automatic voter registration, people without licenses face additional barriers to register and vote. For this subset of the electorate—many of whom are young voters, people with disabilities, members of low-income households, and Black and/or Hispanic Americans—these structural limitations create barriers long before they even get an opportunity to vote. Key findings include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 90% of eligible voters with a driver’s license report registering to vote—but only 50% of those without a driver’s license report registering.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible voters without a driver’s license are more than twice as likely not to have voted than those with one.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also proposes state-level policy reforms that will help ensure voters without a driver’s license have equal access to the ballot box, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding automatic voter registration beyond DMVs to other state agencies that interact with more diverse ranges of eligible voters, such as state health benefit exchanges and local departments of social services.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting alternative signature verification methods—like electronic signature capture, election-day signatures, and by-mail signature collection—to increase accessibility of online voter registration for those without a driver’s license.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Permitting those without an ID at the polls to attest to their identity under penalty of perjury, a method already being used successfully and securely in many states.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The continued protection of community-based voter registration activities at schools, transportation hubs, religious services, and community events. </span></li>

The new law would make those efforts a crime punishable by a fine up to $10,000, imprisonment for up to three years, or both, for any person who knowingly or willfully pays or offers to pay money or other valuable consideration to another to induce them to vote or register to vote or if the payment is made contingent on if a person voted or registered to vote.

Huntington Beach Mayor Pat Burns brought forth the resolution. “To me, there’s been so much question to the last several elections, and it bothers me,” Burns said. “The importance of our republic is that we have solid, trustworthy confidence in our elections. When you don’t have confidence, it discourages participation. I dread the thought of people not voting because they don’t have the confidence because our elections aren’t tight, our systems aren’t tight &#8230; I don’t trust some of the things that I’ve seen.” The city’s resolution asks for infrastructure compliance, voter verification, ballot security, accurate counts and proven outcomes.</span></p>

Del. Bob Long sits on the House Ways and Means Committee, which considers potential changes to election laws and procedures in the state. He is sponsoring a bill that would require a photo ID to vote. Under the proposed bill, a voter would be able to present a valid, non-government photo ID and current utility bill, bank statement or other official document if they do not have a government-issued ID.  Those without any valid form of ID would be able to cast a provisional ballot. Del. Kevin Hornberger is sponsoring a second proposed bill that would require the state Board of Elections to verify a voter&#8217;s citizenship using the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program.  The SAVE program is administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. States and local governments use it to verify a person&#8217;s citizenship or immigration status.  Hornberger said the legislation would give the Board of Elections &#8220;Yet another arrow in their quiver to ensure that those individuals who are registered to vote are citizens.&#8221;</span></p>

But it met resistance from the office in charge of summoning jurors and raised questions for the Senate’s election laws point person. “As of 2024, the voter list was at 770,000 inactive voters — that’s 15% of the registered voters in Massachusetts,” state Rep. Shirley Arriaga, D-8th Hampden, told her colleagues last month. “Removing the link between the municipal census and voter registration ensures that access to the ballot is protected, is strengthened, and everyone in our community has that right [to vote].” Existing law deems a voter “inactive” if they fail to respond to the annual street list, also often referred to as the municipal census. House and Senate bills, respectively sponsored by Arriaga and Sen. Cynthia Stone Creem, D-Norfolk/Middlesex, seek to disrupt that relationship since “Massachusetts is in a minority of jurisdictions that tie voter registration to the municipal census,” according to Creem’s summary.</span></p>

Illinois said candidates must prove an election rule was harmful to bring a court challenge, but most of the justices were concerned the requirement would limit election litigation to high-profile, close cases that pressure courts to intervene in the days and weeks around Election Day. “You’re saying, if the candidate is going to win by 65%, no standing, but if the candidate hopes to win by a dozen votes … then he has standing,” Roberts, a George W. Bush appointee, told Illinois’ solicitor general. “But we’re not going to know that until we get very close to the election, so it’s going to be the most fraught time for the court to get involved in electoral politics.” U.S. Representative Michael Bost, a Republican from Illinois, said the court could avoid that result by loosening the requirements for candidates to bring lawsuits. The only question before the Supreme Court was whether Bost had standing to challenge the mail-in ballot rule — not whether the rule itself was lawful. Illinois argued that Bost needed to show that the ballot deadline hurt his electoral chances. But the justices appeared more receptive to Bost’s arguments, worrying that parsing the degree to which a rule impacted a candidate’s success in a race was too political. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson broke with their conservative colleagues. Sotomayor, a Barack Obama appointee, said lowering standing requirements for candidates could unnecessarily open election rules up to litigation. “[Bost’s] rule would say that that candidate who has not just an insubstantial but a statistically almost impossible chance of winning, that that candidate can come in and seek a change of that rule,” Sotomayor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a brief dated October 7,</span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/briefs/nessel-joins-22-other-state-attorney-generals-backing-federal-voting-rights-fight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 23 state attorneys general</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a lower court’s decision in Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. Howe, which would prevent individuals from suing to enforce the Voting Rights Act.  In their brief, the attorneys general argue in support of the individual right to sue to enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which bars state and local governments from enacting racially discriminatory policies, ensuring American citizens would not be denied or restricted from casting their ballot.  While the U.S. Attorney General and private citizens have been able to file lawsuits to enforce this provision for nearly 60 years, a decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has called that practice into question. In their brief, the group of attorneys general argue that private enforcement of the act is essential, and has acted as the primary avenue for enforcing the law since it was enacted. They also argue that exclusively relying on the U.S. Attorney General to enforce the law would be insufficient to protect voters from racial discrimination. </span></p>

Gary Stubblefield by six months, alleging the current schedule prevents District 26 voters from having a voice during the 2026 fiscal session. The lawsuit, which attorney Jennifer Waymack Standerfer filed in Pulaski County Circuit Court on behalf of Colt Shelby of Cecil, seeks an injunction and an order declaring Stubblefield’s seat must be filled within 150 days of his death. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester are the defendants. “We look forward to a full victory,” Jester said in a statement provided by his spokesperson. The complaint requests a judge hold a hearing within seven days. Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Patricia James was assigned to the case. “The General Assembly will officially convene and begin the 2026 Fiscal Session on April 8, 2026, where it will determine how to spend billions of dollars of taxpayer money and set the state budget for the upcoming fiscal year,” the complaint says. “The Governor’s designated election schedule prevents the people of Senate District 26 from having representation at the 2026 Fiscal Session.”</span></p>

The investigation began earlier this year “when federal officials notified us about certain voters in Arkansas whose voting records appeared to be incongruent with their citizenship status,” Griffin said. Working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Homeland Security Investigations arm, investigators determined the conduct of three people warranted further investigation, according to a news release.  Griffin said in a press conference that such arrests and charges are “rarities” and “not a persistent problem,” but that his office is committed to protecting the integrity of Arkansas elections. He created an Election Integrity Unit in his office’s Special Investigations Division in March 2023.</span></p>

The plaintiffs, represented by former Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, are asking a judge to rule that state funding for partisan primaries violates their rights under the Maryland Constitution. An attorney representing the state is asking the judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The case is scheduled for an Oct. 20 motions hearing. “This case, at its core, is a voting rights case,” Rutherford wrote on behalf of his clients. “It is not, as defendants suggest, a case brought to assert some violation of the Maryland Election law and to challenge a particular election outcome. Nor is it a taxpayer case.” Instead, Rutherford said his clients are asserting that primary elections for the Democratic and Republican parties should not be paid for with tax dollars if nearly 1 million unaffiliated voters in the state cannot participate.</span></p>

The import of those rulings is twofold: First, the specific dispute will continue toward trial; and second, the continuation of the case will keep attention focused on some of the participants’ larger aim—to end Oregon’s vote-by-mail system. Most directly, the judge’s rulings keep alive a petition for review that plaintiff Todd Vaughn filed in June after apparently losing his seat on the Umpqua Public Transportation District board. As OJP has previously reported, Vaughn claims the vote tally, conducted by Douglas County Clerk Dan Loomis, unfairly cost him his seat.</span></p>

The Wisconsin Department of Justice filed the motion on behalf of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, the Department of Transportation, and related state officials. In it, the respondents called Judge Michael Maxwell’s ruling “impermissively vague,” because the order bars election officials from processing new registrations without “verification” of applicants’ citizenship but doesn’t define the verification process. The filing says that any new citizenship verification process for online voter registration would require months of testing and development, and that disabling the electronic registration system in the meantime would conflict with state law requiring that system to exist. “The impact would be enormous: Wisconsin receives an average of more than 200 online voter registrations per day,” the filing states, citing a declaration from Robert Kehoe, the election commission’s deputy administrator. The state Justice Department repeated its argument that a citizenship verification system would exceed what state law requires, noting that the Legislature has expressly required proof of residency for new registrants but not proof of citizenship. The motion further contends Maxwell exceeded his authority by effectively prohibiting local election officials from processing new registrations without verifying citizenship, even though local officials aren’t party to the case.

From partisan gerrymandering and primary systems that drive polarization to calls for proportional representation and ranked-choice voting, Americans are increasingly debating how electoral structures shape the health of our republic. This event—part of R Street’s 250th Anniversary Series—brings together R Street’s Governance Policy Director, Matthew Germer; political analyst Chris Stirewalt; and legal scholar Walter Olson to explore the landscape of electoral reform and what it means for American democracy at 250. Together, they will examine: How current electoral practices affect representation, accountability, and public trust. The range of reforms under discussion, from proportional representation to ranked-choice voting and beyond. The legal, political, and cultural barriers to reform. How the Founders’ principles—equality, popular sovereignty, and civic virtue—might guide us in strengthening democratic institutions today. A reception will follow to continue the conversation. <strong>When:</strong> October 21. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC.</span></p>
