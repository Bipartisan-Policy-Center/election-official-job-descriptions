							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Observations on 2024</strong><br />
<em>Carter Center pilot projects followed international best practices</em></p>
<p>By Rokey Suleman and Sarah Cooper<br />
The Carter Center</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections are the cornerstones of functioning democracies. For decades, <a href="http://www.CarterCenter.org">The Carter Center</a> has been at the forefront of a global community of practice that supports nonpartisan election observation as a means of building public trust and confidence in well-administered elections. In 1989, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford traveled to Panama to jointly lead the first international election observation mission ever funded by the National Endowment for Democracy, a nonprofit created under President Ronald Reagan’s administration to support free and fair elections around the world. Since that time, The Carter Center has observed 125 elections in 40 countries and three Native American nations. It has also worked with other international organizations to develop norms and standards for assessing the quality of elections around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12636" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-27-at-10.30.44 AM-300x259.png" alt="" width="300" height="259" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-27-at-10.30.44 AM-300x259.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-27-at-10.30.44 AM.png 420w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Parallel to efforts on international election observation, the global community of domestic election monitoring organizations also has expanded exponentially. In many countries, it is now common for a broad-based citizen movement to provide public commentary on the conduct of elections, focusing on the overall quality of the process. Credible citizen observer organizations assess the degree to which elections adhere to overarching principles and whether applicable laws and guidelines are consistently and correctly implemented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As outlined in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Declaration of Global Principles for Nonpartisan Election Observation and Monitoring by Citizen Organizations, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 245 citizen organizations in more than 90 countries have committed to observing elections based on key norms and standards. For example, they commit to: undertake their work with accuracy, impartiality, and professionalism; cooperate with election administrators; be transparent about their sources of funding and not accept funds that could constitute a conflict of interest; not obstruct the election processes, officials, candidates, or voters; use systematic observation techniques that incorporate long-term assessments of the election cycle to the greatest extent possible; and make findings publicly available in a complete, accurate, and timely manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., election monitoring efforts are mostly implemented by partisan poll watchers, who are present to represent the candidates of their parties. In many states, the only individuals allowed into a polling location who are not voters or poll workers are partisan monitors or issue-affiliated monitors. While partisan poll watching efforts play an important role, they serve a political interest of tracking issues that could have an impact on their party or candidate. By contrast, nonpartisan citizen election observation focuses on assessing the quality of the democratic process as a whole. Nonpartisan observers care about transparency of the process and not the outcome.  In this way, nonpartisan observation can help build confidence in election processes and results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-12634 alignright" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ObserveNM-300x120.png" alt="" width="300" height="120" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ObserveNM-300x120.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ObserveNM.png 446w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In 2024, The Carter Center provided funding and technical support to nonpartisan citizen-led observation efforts in <a href="https://mteoi.org/">Montana</a>, N<a href="https://observenmelections.org/">ew Mexico</a>, and <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/peace/democracy/u_s_elections/fulton-county-election-observation-mission-final-report-03132025.pdf">Fulton County, Georgia</a>. The efforts in New Mexico and Montana spanned multiple counties and were carried out by in-state networks of local observers – the Montana Election Observation Initiative (MTEOI) and Observe New Mexico Elections (ONME). They were both led by cross-partisan advisory boards of respected leaders in each state. The mission in Fulton County, Georgia was co-led by The Carter Center and the “Monitoring Team,” an independent group of election experts.  In all three missions, observers signed a code of conduct and attended rigorous training on the processes to be observed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-12635 alignleft" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/FultonCoObservers-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />The MTEOI and ONME observation missions began preparing to observe in summer 2024, with initial efforts focused on assessing state election laws and processes and meeting local election officials. The teams gathered key information about the process, equipment, rules, and deadlines at each stage of the process to be observed, working in close coordination with local election officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Carter Center and its partners are grateful to election officials in both New Mexico and Montana who made sure that all stages of the election processes were accessible to observation. It is worth noting that citizen observation efforts like these are not designed to be ‘gotcha’ exercises aimed at critiquing election operations. Rather, the overarching goal of these efforts is to foster trust and transparency in well-run elections, regardless of the outcome. Observers closely tracked the key stages of the election process – such <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-12637 alignright" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MontanaElectionObservers-300x151.png" alt="" width="300" height="151" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MontanaElectionObservers-300x151.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MontanaElectionObservers.png 565w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />as logic and accuracy testing, poll worker training, ballot processing and tabulation, in-person voting, and post-election audits – and filled out detailed, structured reporting forms to record their findings in a systematic way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The observation efforts found that the elections in Montana, New Mexico, and Fulton County, Georgia were generally well-run. Voters had open access to the polls, and critical processes were well-conducted overall. The final reports from each mission also highlight a few areas where elections processes could be improved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building on the success of these independent observation missions, The Carter Center intends to expand its program in future federal election cycles. Efforts are underway to determine which states are well-suited for possible nonpartisan election observation. The Center hopes that election officials across the country will be interested to learn more about these efforts and is confident that, as these citizen-led efforts grow, so will trust in U.S. elections.</span></p>

Needless to say, the reaction from elections officials and experts was swift. </span><a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=149153"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rick Hasen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a professor at UCLA Law School and expert on election law, told Votebeat he expects litigation over the issue to be filed immediately. Hasen said the order assumes that the White House has more power over independent agencies — in this case the U.S. Election Assistance Commission — than was previously understood. “It was thought to be that he has no power over the Election Assistance Commission,” he said. “This would be quite the sea change.” Many have latched on to the threat to withhold federal funding, given that there really is no more federal funding since federal grants have been expended or dried up. “I would love for there to be more of a pool of money at jeopardy here,” said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in California, who was a civil-rights official in the U.S. Justice Department and a former adviser on voting rights to the Biden administration. “‘Would you like me to take away a penny?’ That’s what he’s essentially saying to states,” he added wryly. David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, said a</span><a href="https://www.ksut.org/2025-03-26/legal-challenges-are-expected-for-president-trumps-voter-registration-executive-order"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> court challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to &#8220;this kind of presidential power grab&#8221;  would likely succeed. He said the executive order &#8220;purports to require the states to create vast new bureaucracies and radically change their election processes and equipment at a likely cost in the tens of billions of dollars, and the president cannot do that with a simple swipe of his pen.&#8221; Meanwhile, states that are in the process of conducting spring and primary elections have noted that the new EO </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/03/26/experts-say-trump-order-requiring-proof-of-citizenship-for-voting-wont-apply-to-april-1-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will not impact the current elections process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ann Jacobs, the Democratic chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission,</span><a href="https://x.com/AnnJacobsMKE/status/1904645533357998152"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social media that there are a number of reasons why the order won’t apply to the election next week. The order only applies to federal elections and there are no federal offices on the ballot — only elections for state and local offices. And the order is not set to go into effect for 30 days, long after April 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3788" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />List Maintenance:</strong> Also this week, the Republican National Committee launched a massive effort to probe voter registration lists nationwide amid a broader strategy to seize on voter rolls to question the integrity of elections. RNC sent p</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-rnc-trump-misinformation-voter-files-d483ed9a67a7816a3c77231f7ccf885d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ublic records requests asking for documents related to voter roll list maintenance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the top election officials in 48 states and the District of Columbia, asserting that the public should know how states are removing ineligible people from voter rolls, including dead people and noncitizens. “Voters have a right to know that their states are properly maintaining voter rolls and quickly acting to clean voter registration lists by removing ineligible voters,” RNC chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement. At the state level, </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/sweeping-cancellation-of-455k-voter-registrations-planned-in-georgia/4KTEZHQTANH4NFNKXI4I3U4NEU/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced this week it has plans to cancel about 455,000 inactive voter registrations this summer, one of the largest registration removals in U.S. history. More than half the registrations scheduled for cancellation were identified by a 24-state organization called ERIC, which reports when a voter has moved and is no longer eligible to vote in Georgia. In </span><a href="https://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/after-biennial-cleanup-144-000-individuals-removed-from-idaho-voter-rolls/article_fdcc59d6-623f-45d7-9d54-2d7f950925df.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, county election offices have removed more than 144,000 individuals from Idaho’s voter rolls after recently completing voter registration maintenance required every two years under Idaho law. And in </span><a href="https://www.wtvy.com/2025/03/23/102-year-old-wwii-veteran-mistaken-dead-voter-registration-canceled/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in an effort to clean up voting rolls, one 102-year-old World War II Vet was accidentally removed. Officials say that every quarter, the California Secretary of State gives county election officials a list of registered voters who’ve had a birthday that makes them 100 years or older and could be a potential match for a deceased record. Using that list, officials in San Joaquin County mistakenly canceled Marvin Lykins’ voter registration. “Unfortunately, there are people who will assume that. Just because you’re 100 doesn’t mean you’re dead,” Lykins said. The veteran’s daughter helped him re-register to vote, and he’ll be able to exercise that right in the next election.

He was 81. Current Secretary of State Steve Hobbs announced his predecessor’s passing, saying Munro “embodied the drive and attitude of a true statesman.” During his life, Munro championed diverse causes from orca protection, voting expansion and disability rights, to immigration, international trade, polio eradication and historic preservation. “Ralph was known for moderation, civility and bipartisanship. He certainly exuded that in his role as secretary of state,” recalled friend and longtime collaborator Sam Reed, who succeeded Munro in office. Munro’s decades-long political career began with a job as a supply clerk in the basement of the Capitol building in Olympia. A couple of encounters with Gov. Dan Evans scored Munro an invite to join the governor’s staff in the late 1960s. Evans, also a moderate Republican, mentored Munro and promoted him to special assistant. In elective office, Munro was one of the last Republicans able to consistently win statewide as Washington trended bluer and bluer. He squeaked into office as secretary of state in 1980 at age 37 and was reelected four more times until he chose to retire at the end of 2000. During his tenure, Munro strongly advocated for expanding vote-by-mail. Washington also established “motor voter” registration on his watch, which encourages residents to register to vote when they apply for or renew a driver’s license. He also ushered in Washington’s first address confidentiality program to protect victims of domestic violence and stalking. That program allowed victims to receive mail through the secretary of state’s office in order to keep their actual addresses secret. Munro faced minimal competition for re-election in his later campaigns. His political ads on the radio memorably entailed 30 seconds of bagpipe music with a brief tagline stating, “This interlude brought to you by” the Munro campaign.</span></p>

Voters express their electoral preferences through their ballot. More states and local jurisdictions are adopting ranked choice voting (RCV), which affects how voter preferences are translated into electoral results by introducing a more complex ranked ballot and accompanying tabulation process. This research provides empirical estimates of rates of improper marking and vote rejection, and compares them to those rates on non-ranked offices (particularly single-mark, ‘choose-one-candidate’ offices). We describe a new, general typology for categorizing the ways voters can improperly mark a ranked ballot. We apply this typology to a database of ranked choice ballots that includes 3 million cast vote records representing over three-quarters of all Americans living in a jurisdiction that uses RCV. The data show that in a typical ranked choice race, nearly 1 in 20 (4.8%) voters improperly mark their ballot in at least one way. We argue that these improper marks are consistent with voter confusion about their ranked ballot, and find evidence that this mismarking rate is higher in areas with more racial minorities, lower-income households, and lower levels of educational attainment. We further find that votes in ranked choice races are about 10 times more likely to be rejected due to an improper mark than votes in non-ranked choice races. These findings raise key questions about voter participation and representation in ranked choice systems and have important policy implications for jurisdictions that already have or are considering adopting ranked choice voting.</span></p>

The Only Citizens Vote Act, or</span><a href="https://arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?id=HB1422&amp;ddBienniumSession=2025%2F2025R"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 1422</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would have changed both state law and the state Constitution. Changing the latter via legislative action requires a minimum two-thirds vote from lawmakers, or 67 votes in the House. Only 53 House members, all Republicans, supported the bill. Fourteen more Republicans did not vote. The constitutional change in question would have added references to the proposed new statute to Arkansas Constitutional Amendment 51, which lists the documents required for voter registration. Those documents include a Social Security card and a driver’s license or state-issued identification card, both of which noncitizens are able to obtain, bill sponsor Rep. Wayne Long, R-Bradford, told a House committee that narrowly passed the bill Wednesday. HB 1422 would have required the Department of Finance and Administration to share “names and identifying information of each” noncitizen with an Arkansas-issued ID or driver’s license with the Secretary of State’s office, which oversees elections. If a noncitizen was found to be registered to vote, the bill would have required the secretary of state to refer the individual to the Attorney General’s office for prosecution, and the clerk of the noncitizen’s county of residence would have been required to cancel the person’s voter registration. The individual would have had the chance to provide proof of U.S. citizenship after being notified of the secretary of state’s actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Arkansas Ballot Measure</strong>: Attorney General Tim Griffin</span><a href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/03/25/arkansas-ag-rejects-proposed-ballot-measure-to-amend-states-direct-democracy-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rejected a proposed ballot measure </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that aims to amend the state’s initiative and referendum process. Griffin cited ambiguities as his reason for rejecting the proposed ballot title and language, which Little Rock attorney David Couch submitted on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Arkansas on March 11. State law requires the attorney general to approve or reject a proposed ballot measure along with its ballot title and popular name within 10 business days of receiving the original draft. Tuesday was the deadline for Griffin to do so.  Concerns over transparency and accessibility prompted the nonpartisan nonprofit to submit its proposal, according to a press release. Key provisions of the proposed constitutional amendment include prohibiting the General Assembly from amending a voter-approved constitutional amendment with a two-thirds vote, which is currently permitted, and allowing canvassers to submit signatures under penalty of perjury in place of requiring notarization of signatures. The measure also would require the attorney general’s office to approve or modify the language of ballot titles. Once approved, challenges would have to be filed with the Arkansas Supreme Court, which would prevent legal disputes after signature collection, according to the press release. One of the ambiguities cited in Griffin’s</span><a href="https://ag-opinions.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025-018.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 15-page opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is how the proposed ballot measure would change the law regarding the General Assembly’s authority to amend the state Constitution. Griffin also took issue with how the measure would amend the ballot title review process. By removing the option for the attorney general to reject the popular name and ballot title altogether, which is currently allowed under state law, Griffin said the measure would create a scenario whereby the state’s chief lawyer would be unable to act in certain circumstances. </span></p>

State Sen. Sabrina Cervantes is unveiling a bill today that would</span><a href="https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202520260sb266"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expand the number of languages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting ballots and voting instructions are available for California voters. Backed by good governance advocacy organizations including Common Cause California and the immigrants rights group the Asian Law Caucus, Cervantes’ bill would direct California’s Secretary of State to identify the languages spoken by at least 3% of voting-age residents in a county who don’t speak English fluently — including languages not guaranteed by current federal voting rights laws. Election officials would then be required to provide voting ballots, ballot envelopes and related voting instructions in these languages. If the bill becomes law, 28 more counties would be required to provide voters with ballots in Spanish (bringing the total to 56 counties) and 23 more would need to provide ballots in Tagalog (for a total of 29). Sacramento County, for example, would also be required to provide ballots in Ukrainian and Arabic for the first time. The bill would go into effect by December 2029, so not in time for California’s primary election next year or the general election in November 2028. Another proposal by Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a Moreno Valley Democrat, would require elections officials to provide voter information and ballots</span><a href="https://calmatters.digitaldemocracy.org/bills/ca_202520260ab72"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Bengali by request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

The bill, which now proceeds to the Assembly Public Safety Committee, would make three changes to law. First, it would clarify that </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/california-lawmaker-seeks-to-clarify-elections-officials-role-in-certification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">certifying an election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a ministerial and nondiscretionary duty of elections officials. Failure to certify an election would lead to a transfer of all election materials from that jurisdiction to the California Secretary of State’s Office, which would count and certify the vote. Second, the legislation would make it a crime to provide or solicit someone to put a ballot in an envelope that isn’t an official return envelope. Third, the bill would require officials to make voter information guides reach inmates who are eligible to vote.</span></p>

The county initially sought a ruling against the citizen&#8217;s group behind the measure, the &#8220;Shasta Five,&#8221; arguing it violated state and federal election laws. However, Judge Benjamin Hanna denied the county&#8217;s request, prompting last week’s special meeting. Following the meeting, county counsel announced that the board unanimously decided to drop the lawsuit and allow County Counsel Joseph Larmour to draft a title and summary for the measure.</span></p>

The legislation –</span><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2025/TOB/H/PDF/2025HB-07229-R00-HB.PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 7229</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, An Act Concerning Accessibility to Absentee Ballots for Electors in State Custody – seeks to close this gap. The proposal, which was the subject of testimony on Friday before the Government Administration and Elections Committee, aims to establish a clear, consistent absentee ballot process for individuals detained pretrial or serving sentences for misdemeanor offenses. In other words, people who have not lost their right to vote under Connecticut law. Supporters of the bill argue it would create a streamlined absentee ballot request process, mandate voter education materials in correctional facilities, and require coordination between election officials and the Department of Correction. Crucially, the bill would clarify that individuals should vote based on their last address before incarceration – an existing legal standard that has often gone unenforced in practice. Opponents of the bill have generally not disputed that many incarcerated people retain the right to vote, but some warn about voter fraud risks, identity verification concerns, or broader philosophical objections about voting access in correctional facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators on the Government Administration and Elections Committee held a public hearing to solicit input on the newly proposed bills —</span><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?which_year=2025&amp;selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=1515"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB 1515</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?which_year=2025&amp;selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=1516"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1516</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — which lawmakers hope will </span><a href="https://ctmirror.org/2025/03/21/bridgeport-voter-fraud-charges-ct-election-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase oversight and cut down on alleged election fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. SB 1515 is focused heavily on increasing state oversight of local town clerks and registrar of voters, the people who actively manage the state’s voting precincts and absentee voting process. Meanwhile, segments of SB 1516 are aimed at fixing some of the problems highlighted in the election complaints and criminal charges stemming from Bridgeport’s 2023 primary. Lawmakers are proposing, for instance, to create a setback distance from curbside voting locations and to make it illegal for any political candidate to sit in a vehicle with a voter while they cast a ballot using curbside voting equipment. Lawmakers are also seeking to ban anyone who is found guilty of an election-related crime from circulating candidate petitions or applications for absentee ballots for up to 12 years.</span></p>

House Bill 88, sponsored by Rep. Bill Bush and Sen. Kyra Hoffner, seeks to give lawmakers the power to set voter registration laws without a deadline before an election—clearing the path for people in Delaware to register and vote in a single trip. “Same-day registration has been successfully implemented in several states for decades and has proven to increase voter turnout safely and effectively,” Bush said. The measure follows a 2022 Delaware Supreme Court ruling that struck down a previous law permitting same-day registration, stating the change required a constitutional amendment. HB 88 is designed to address that ruling by explicitly authorizing the General Assembly to allow same-day registration. If passed, the bill would amend the state constitution to remove the current requirement that voter registration close on the fourth Saturday before an election. It would also direct lawmakers to ensure any future voter registration laws include safeguards for accuracy and integrity, including valid photo identification or documentation verifying a voter’s name and address.</span></p>

The bill (</span><a href="https://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=81899&amp;SessionId=105"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1205</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) sponsored by Lee County Republican Jenna Persons-Mulicka would make a series of changes to the state’s already extensive initiative-gathering process. It passed this week on a party-line vote after more than two hours of sometimes intense reaction in public testimony. Provisions in the legislation include: Requiring the petition sponsor to post a $1 million bond payable to the Division of Elections once the sponsor has obtained a letter from the department confirming that 25% of the requisite number of signatures has been obtained. If a person who is collecting or handling initiatives petitions is found to not be a U.S. citizen or is convicted of a felony without having his right to vote restored, the petition sponsor is liable for a $50,000 fine for each person. The bill revises the deadline by which petitions must be delivered by the petition sponsor to a supervisor of elections from 30 days to 10 days and increases the fines from a $50 flat fee for each late petition form to $50 for each day late for a total fine of up to $2,500 per late petition form. If the sponsor or petition circulator acted “willfully,” the bill increases the penalty from $250 for each petition form to $2,500. The bill requires all petition circulators — volunteers as well as paid staffers — to be residents of Florida. It says that before a paid petition circulator is registered, he or she must submit to a criminal background check. The bill creates a signature revocation process that allows a voter to revoke his or her signature from a petition form. The supervisor of elections must post on their website the total number of signatures revoked every month, and later every week. If the percentage rises to more than 10% of the total petitions received during that period, the Office of Election Crimes and Security is required to conduct a preliminary investigation and may report findings to the statewide prosecutor or applicable state attorney for prosecution.</span></p>

A bill proposed this week would require almost all Georgia voters to bubble in their choices at polling places instead of using touchscreen computers that print out paper ballots. With just more than a week left in this year’s legislative session, senators said final votes on the bill might not be held until 2026. Under the bill, hand-marked paper ballots would become Georgia’s primary voting method, with touchscreens still available for voters with disabilities. Ballots would be printed on demand at early voting locations to accommodate different races and districts, but they could be preprinted in smaller election day precincts where most voters receive the same ballot. The cost of switching voting systems wasn’t immediately clear. It would cost millions of dollars to buy on-demand ballot printers for each of Georgia’s 2,600 voting locations.</span></p>

The rewritten bill would mandate the kind of hand ballot counts proposed by the board last fall, give the board authority over voter eligibility appeals and withdraw Georgia from a multistate voter accuracy organization. The 26-page legislation includes many new proposals never previously debated this year, with just a week and a half left in the legislative session. The latest version is entirely different from the bill that passed the House, removing a provision allowing legislative leaders to remove State Election Board members. The measure,</span><a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#bills/HB/397"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 397</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeks to encode several State Election Board rules the courts overturned last year, including the proposal to count ballots cast by hand after polls close on election night. Under the bill, votes would still be tabulated by machines, with the hand count verifying the number of ballots. The legislation also includes other board priorities, including giving partisan poll watchers access to vote-counting areas and requiring video surveillance of drop boxes after early voting locations close. Additionally, the bill would bar voters from hand-delivering absentee ballots the weekend before Election Day.</span></p>

The bill also allows the office to work with other states to compare voter lists and identify registered people in more than one state.Additionally, the secretary of state would review all new voter registrations within 90 days of any statewide election. “This is ensuring our voter roll is as accurate and as current as possible,” Secretary of State Phil McGrane said. “This really just gives us the tools to make comparisons with other government agencies or other states to ensure nobody is voting twice and that people’s records are up to date. That’s moving forward.”</span></p>

Timothy Wesco (R-Osceola), chair of the House Elections Committee, said. Under the proposed bill, students seeking to vote in Indiana would need to possess a state-issued Indiana ID. Additionally, the bill includes provisions referred to by Republicans as a &#8220;cleanup&#8221; of voter rolls. One measure would require county clerks to send notifications to voters who have not participated in the last two general elections, aiming to confirm their residency status in the state.</span></p>

It also has language introduced by Pate ahead of the 2025 legislative session to allow the Secretary of State’s office to contract with federal and state agencies, as well as private entities, for verification and maintenance of the state’s voter rolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House lawmakers also passed a measure dealing with election recounts,</span><a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF%20928&amp;ga=91"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House File 928</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in a 66-31 vote Tuesday. The bill sets a threshold of a 1% difference in votes — or 50 votes, whichever is less — to request a recount. While the state would cover the costs of a recount if the results are within 0.1% — a smaller margin than the 1% under current Iowa law — the candidate or their committee that requests the election recount must pay for the costs of the recount process if it fails to change the election result. Candidates would be required to request a recount by the end of the day following the election canvass — the second Wednesday after the election — moving it up from the current deadline of Friday following the canvass deadline. The bill also requires that legislative, statewide and federal races all request a recount through the Secretary of State’s office, requiring the state office to distribute notice to county auditors instead of having this task performed by the campaign.</span></p>

Shalleck has been acting vice chair of the Maryland State Board of Elections since July 2024. State lawmakers have taken a much closer look at elections board candidates from both political parties after a former Republican member, Carlos Ayala, who was approved by the committee and confirmed without questioning, was arrested for his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Shalleck was appointed last year by Gov. Wes Moore upon a recommendation from the state GOP and began serving as the board’s acting vice chair in July. Shalleck had to wait until lawmakers were in session to complete the vetting process.</span></p>

House Bill 201 would require paid ballot initiative signature gatherers to disclose their status as paid workers, as well as their states of residence, when collecting signatures. During a committee hearing on the bill, Mitchell said it would discourage “the use of out-of-state workers who may lack a personal connection to the local issues” and reduce “concerns about hidden agendas or external influences.”  House Bill 818 would bar foreign entities from contributing to ballot initiatives. Federal law already prohibits foreign citizens from contributing directly to U.S. elections. However, there is</span><a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/2024/02/politics-ads-foreigners-super-pac-contributions-federal-law-loophole-fact-brief/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no prohibition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on foreign nationals donating to 501(c)(4) groups such as the National Rifle Association or the American Civil Liberties Union, which can then donate to PACs, or political action committees, which support candidates and ballot issues. House Bill 179, also related to ballot initiatives, would reinforce in law that voters cannot be moved from “inactive” to “active” status by signing a ballot initiative petition. Currently, voters who are placed on the inactive rolls can reactivate their voting status by visiting their county election office, appearing at a polling place on Election Day, requesting an absentee ballot or reregistering to vote by mail. Signing a petition does not move inactive voters to active status.</span></p>

HB 154 passed on the House floor in a contested voice vote with no discussion. But during a vote in the House Election Law Committee, Republicans said the vote was meant to give voters the ability to cast their ballots the way they wanted to. Others, including House Election Law Committee Chairman Ross Berry, a Weare Republican, said they supported giving voters the choice but advised voters to consider whether they wanted their ballots hand-counted in the first place. “I will issue a word of caution: When you do this, when you exercise this … you’re saying, I want somebody who’s been up for 16 hours straight to pull out my ballot and read it amongst other ballots that are either put in that bin or had errors,” Berry said. “My experience in the recounts shows that the machines are far more accurate than the people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House also killed </span><a href="https://gc.nh.gov/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2025&amp;id=12&amp;txtFormat=html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 600</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would have enabled cities to choose to hold elections using </span><a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2025/03/26/house-passes-bill-allowing-new-hampshire-voters-to-request-their-ballot-be-hand-counted/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked-choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a process in which voters list candidates in order of preference, and second and third choices are factored in if a candidate does not receive at least 50 percent of the vote. Advocates for that system say it eliminates the potential for politicians to be elected with a plurality of votes and encourages candidates to court their opponent’s voters, discouraging partisanship. But Republicans said the system is confusing, can be time consuming for election officials, and is not needed.</span></p>

One makes it illegal for someone transporting another person’s mail-in ballot to be paid, and the second lets each county board of elections expand electioneering boundaries around polling places. The bearer bill, sponsored by state Sen. Gordon Johnson, D-Englewood, prohibits any person from being paid or offered goods or services to be a messenger or a bearer of vote-by-mail ballots. The current law authorizes messengers to deliver blank mail-in ballots to qualified voters who are either family members or residents of the same county, often elderly or disabled members of the community. After the ballot is completed, a bearer can return a limited number of ballots to a ballot drop box, a regular mailbox or the county board of elections. This bill would formally make it a criminal act to be paid or receive gifts, goods or services to be a messenger or bearer of ballots in New Jersey. That bill passed with a vote total of 30-8. The second bill, sponsored by Senate President Nick Scutari, D-Union, and state Sen. Bob Smith, D-Middlesex, would allow county boards of elections to extend the distance restricting electioneering from 100 feet to 200 feet of the outside entrance to any polling place or room or of a ballot drop box in use during the conduct of an election within the county. The bill passed with a vote total of 31-8.</span></p>

She said opening primaries to unaffiliated voters will expand turnout and democratic buy-in from an increasingly disaffected voter base, particularly young people. As of December 2024, 340,000 New Mexico voters, roughly a quarter of all voters in the state, were not affiliated with any of the state’s three major parties, which are Democrats, Republicans or Libertarians, according to the Secretary of State’s Office. And 40% of New Mexico voters aged 18 to 24 are unaffiliated, Parajón said during the floor debate Friday.</span></p>

But special conservancy districts have never been included, because of the complexities of running an election in which people might not be registered voters, but own property in the counties where the districts lie. The original law delayed implementation for conservancy districts until 2022, and New Mexico in 2023 again pushed back implementation for the districts, until this year. </span><a href="https://www.nmlegis.gov/Legislation/Legislation?Chamber=H&amp;LegType=B&amp;LegNo=308&amp;year=25"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 308</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> permanently exempts two local conservancy districts from the Local Election Act: the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District based in Albuquerque and the Arch Hurley Conservancy District based in Tucumcari.</span></p>

The bill will prohibit employers from taking disciplinary action against an employee for attending training or serving as an election official. Additionally, employers will be prohibited from requiring employees to use their annual, vacation, or sick leave to perform their duties as long as they give reasonable notice of absence. “With the gradual decrease in poll-working volunteers over the years, the time to act is now,” said Klopfenstein. “While current law provides some protections to our employees, it doesn’t go far enough.” Current law only restricts employers from refusing to allow an employee to serve as an elected official on any registration or election day. According to the Ohio Association of Election Officials, Ohio has lost 10-15% of poll workers annually. This bill awaits a number and committee assignment.</span></p>

Under current law, nonaffiliated voters are unable to vote in most primary elections including primaries for congressional, gubernatorial, other statewide offices and legislative candidates. Political parties can open their primaries but most in Oregon, including Democrats and Republicans, hold closed primaries. An amendment to the bill would require all candidates for partisan and nonpartisan offices in Oregon to appear on the same primary election ballot regardless of political party. The top two candidates would advance to the general election ballot. The change would exclude candidates for president and vice president of the United States. The bill also would require candidates to have a political party’s endorsement before using a party’s label on the ballot.</span></p>

Under current Texas law, felons can vote again after completing their full sentence, which includes time behind bars, probation, parole and supervised release. SB 631, introduced by Eckhardt, would remove the parole and probation requirements and allow those convicted of felonies to vote so long as they are not currently behind bars. Bucy has introduced a companion bill in the House, along with another bill on the topic, HB 590. That bill would require the Texas Secretary of State&#8217;s Office to notify Texans who have completed their felony sentences that they are eligible to register to vote again. &#8220;No red tape, no politics, just basic transparency and communication,&#8221; Bucy said. &#8220;So many people don&#8217;t know, and we want to make it simple to get people reengaged.&#8221;</span></p>

This program allows voters to cast their ballots, similar to early voting, at any voting center on Election Day. “Vote centers have been popular among El Paso County voters since first used in the November 2020 Presidential Election,” said Lisa Wise, El Paso County elections administrator. The Countywide polling program has been in effect for all elections since November 2020. The resolution was meant to show support for the system as some Republicans in the state Legislature have targeted it. Two bills have been filed this legislative session to eliminate this option for voters, according to the Texas Tribune. “El Paso County voters have come to rely on the convenience and choice that the Countywide Polling Place Program offers. In our most recent Presidential Election, 60% of voters who voted on Election Day chose to vote outside their precinct. That’s an increase from 27% in the November 2020 Presidential Election,” Wise added. The resolution further supports the use of electronic pollbooks, emphasizing that eliminating them would limit transparency and hinder the ability for voters, parties, and candidates to perform their own audits and reconciliation during elections, the County Elections Department said. </span></p>

Spencer Cox (R) signed legislation into law this week that will revamp the state’s vote by mail system. </span><a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2025/03/26/utah-gov-cox-signs-bill-end/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Amendments to Election Law,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or HB300 was included in the middle of a list of 100 bills Cox signed this week. The law is set to end Utah’s popular universal vote-by-mail election system, forcing voters to opt in before 2029 to receive and send a ballot through the mail. The governor did not include a comment on his decision to sign the bill in the news release, as he has for some other bills. An initial version of the bill would have effectively eliminated Utahns’ option to vote via the postal service altogether, but the version Cox ultimately signed allows voters to opt in to participating in elections through the mail. Utahns must opt in before 2029, when counties will stop sending ballots to every voter’s mailbox. The law also starts Utah on the path of transitioning toward relying on the last four digits of a state ID number — or, if they don’t have one, the last four digits of their Social Security number — rather than the voter’s signature to verify a mail-in ballot. It also moves up the deadline for returning a ballot, requiring voters to ensure that county clerks receive mailed ballots before 8 p.m. Election Day — likely resulting in fewer ballots being counted. Previously, all ballots postmarked by the day before Election Day were counted.</span></p>

Supporters of the bills argue they would reduce voter fraud and election discrepancies. This week, Gov. Patrick Morrisey also signed a bill banning ranked choice voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State code generally already requires voters to show some form of identification at the polls to prove their voting eligibility.</span><a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=hb3016%20intr.htm&amp;yr=2025&amp;sesstype=RS&amp;i=3016"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 3016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would require that to be a </span><a href="https://wvpublic.org/house-considers-expanding-photo-id-citizenship-verification-laws-for-voters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">photo ID</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — namely, a driver’s license, passport or a resident identification card. The bill would also require state IDs to denote if a resident is not a U.S. citizen with the word “non-citizen.” The bill is sponsored by Del. Erica Moore, R-Roane, and was discussed by members of the House Judiciary Committee last week. Proponents of the bill say it could reduce voter fraud, and that obtaining qualifying IDs in the state is already an accessible process. Opponents of the bill worry verifying a resident’s citizen status between the secretary of state’s office and department of motor vehicles could be a technically faulty process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5169" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WyomingCapitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Wyoming:</strong> Wyoming residents will soon need to provide </span><a href="https://wyofile.com/governor-allows-proof-of-voter-residency-citizenship-requirement-to-become-law-without-signature/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proof of citizenship and residency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when registering to vote following Gov. Mark Gordon’s decision to allow a bill to become law without his signature.  Set to go into effect in July, the law makes Wyoming the first and only state to require proof of citizenship as part of its voter registration.  The new law also requires residents, for the first time ever, to attest that they’ve lived in the state for at least 30 days before casting a ballot. That requirement clashes with both the Wyoming Constitution and federal law, Gordon wrote in a</span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sV3qZVkO34oz_M5egP1IZ2G2GoQZr5AM/view"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Secretary of State Chuck Gray who pressed for the measure.  “I cannot sign it as such,” the governor wrote of the new law. Last year, Gray sought to enact such requirements</span><a href="https://wyofile.com/gordon-gray-spar-over-wyoming-election-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outside of the lawmaking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> process by adopting them via executive rulemaking. But Gordon rejected the rules on the basis that they exceeded the scope of the secretary’s legal authority. The governor referenced this in his Friday letter to Gray.  “Because it is laudable to continuously improve our standards for identification, I am thrilled that this legislation now gives the Secretary of State the authority he was trying to usurp by passing rules he had no authority to pass last spring,” Gordon wrote. “The will of the Legislature is finally clear on this point.”</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5488" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CT-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Connecticut:</strong> Five people accused of </span><a href="https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/bridgeport-absentee-ballot-fraud-defendants-20233594.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violating election laws during the 2023 mayoral primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have pleaded not guilty to the charges. One by one, Judge Tracy Lee Dayton called the defendants  — Alfredo Castillo, Maria Pereira and Jazmarie Melendez, all City Council members, as well as Wanda Geter-Pataky, vice chair of the Democratic Town Committee, and Stratford resident Margaret Joyce — to the defense table in her  courtroom, where attorneys representing them formally entered the not guilty pleas and asked for jury trials as they review discovery evidence turned over by prosecutors. Their cases were continued to May 7, with the understanding that Joyce and Pereira will go to court April 9 to discuss their cases with special public defenders that have not yet been appointed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3355" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ga-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Georgia:</strong> U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee has </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judges-ruling-keeps-georgias-2021-voting-law-intact/RCH4NLUEUJDSDDL3JCXIN64N2I/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thrown out a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that challenged whether the state could take over county election oversight and prohibit ballot photography. Boulee ruled that the plaintiffs, led by the election security group Coalition for Good Governance, failed to show they had been harmed by the provisions in Georgia’s 2021 voting law. Boulee did not rule on the merits of the lawsuit. Boulee had previously put the ballot photography ban on hold in 2021, finding that such far-reaching restrictions violated free speech protections. That ruling allowed photographing ballots while they were being counted, recounted or audited. It remained illegal to photograph completed ballots in polling places while voting was underway. But Boulee’s ruling this week ends the case, and with it, his prior decision on ballot photography. “The court’s decision affirms the integrity of Georgia’s elections and upholds the state’s ability to allow every lawful voter the opportunity to cast a ballot,” said Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. “Since the passage of Senate Bill 202, Georgia has conducted multiple successful elections with record voter turnout, proving that election integrity measures and voter access can go hand in hand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3623" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LouisianaFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Louisiana:</strong> Louisiana officials </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2025/03/24/u-s-supreme-court-hears-arguments-over-louisiana-redistricting-plan-with-2-majority-black-seats/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argued before the U.S. Supreme Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week that it should retain the state’s two majority-Black districts in Congress that non-Black voters have challenged. According to the Louisiana Illuminator, the court seemed closely divided over the case, with conservative justices suggesting they may throw out the map and make it harder to bring lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act, landmark civil rights legislation that allows voters the right to sue over possible infringements of their voting rights.  The arguments defending Louisiana’s map, which state legislators adopted last year, were presented by a set of strange bedfellows: Solicitor General Benjamin Aguiñaga and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The NAACP fought Anguiñaga’s boss, Republican Attorney General Liz Murrill, and her predecessor, now Gov. Jeff Landry, in court over a 2022 version of redistricting plans.  Before the state’s highest court, Anguiñaga and Stuart Naifeh with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said politics, not race, drove the creation of the map. Partisan gerrymandering remains legal in the United States, but racial gerrymandering is not. Aguiñaga also complained to the justices that the flurry of conflicting lawsuits make it difficult for states to know what to do. The Supreme Court’s decision in the Callais case will likely come this summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5257" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MI-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Michigan:</strong> A group of Republican state lawmakers is </span><a href="https://www.michiganpublic.org/politics-government/2025-03-24/gop-legislators-ask-us-supreme-court-to-let-them-sue-over-mich-election-rules"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asking the U.S. Supreme Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to clear the way for them to challenge two voter-approved amendments to the Michigan Constitution. This is a last-ditch effort by the GOP legislators to pursue their challenge without the full backing of a politically divided House and Senate. The legislators are asking the high court to accept the case and rule that state lawmakers have individual standing to file the challenge and do not have to wait on formal action by the GOP-controlled House and the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. “Unless you have an agreement of both chambers of the Legislature, there’s no way to get an answer to this question except by going through individual legislators,” said Sen. Jim Runestad, who is also the Michigan Republican Party chair. “The only hope we have of a good clear look at the legality of this is the U.S. Supreme Court.” The underlying controversy is the fate of two ballot proposals adopted by voters in</span><a href="https://sfa.senate.michigan.gov/Publications/BallotProps/Proposal18-3.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.house.mi.gov/hfa/PDF/Alpha/Background_Brief_Proposal_22-2_Jan2024.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The voting rights proposals include provisions that include making it easier to register to vote, to vote absentee and to use early voting options. The Republican lawmakers say those ballot questions usurp their constitutional authority of the Legislature to set “the time, place and manner” of federal elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-11468" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NewMNFlag-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Minnesota:</strong> The Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled this week that the </span><a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-absentee-ballot-witness-requirement-is-legal-court-of-appeals/601243066"><span style="font-weight: 400;">witness requirement </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for Minnesotans to vote by absentee ballot does not violate the Voting Rights Act or the Civil Rights Act because the voter — and not the witness — is ultimately vouching for the legality of their ballot. This week’s opinion means an effective dismissal of a 2024 lawsuit brought by the Minnesota Alliance for Retired Americans Educational Fund against Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon challenging the witness requirement. It’s unclear whether the alliance will ask the Minnesota Supreme Court to hear the case. When a person votes absentee — as 27% of the Minnesota electorate did in 2022 — they mark their ballot, place the ballot inside a sealed envelope, then put that envelope inside the “signature envelope,” which includes a certificate of eligibility with two required signatures. One is from the voter, swearing they meet all legal requirements to vote by an absentee ballot. The other signature is for the witness who verifies the ballot was unmarked when given to the voter, the voter marked the ballot in the presence of the witness or, if they were physically unable, “directed another individual” to mark the ballot, and that, if the voter was not previously registered, they gave the witness proof of residency. The Court of Appeals opinion, written by Judge Louise Bjorkman and signed by Judge JaPaul Harris and retired Judge Lucinda Jesson, also determined that plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit but determined Minnesota’s witness requirement did not violate the Voting Rights Act or the Civil Rights Act.</span></p>

Wilson wrote in the court&#8217;s</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/new-york-court-of-appeals-noncitizen-voting-ruling.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> majority opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division insofar as appealed from should be modified, without costs, in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed.” The law  — which did not grant noncitizens the right to vote in presidential, congressional or state elections — allowed green-card holders and individuals with work permits who have lived in the city for at least a month to vote in municipal elections. The progressive majority of seven-judge Court of Appeals resolutely sided 6-to-1 with New York Republicans, affirming that the text of the New York Constitution limits voting to citizens. “Reading Article II as a whole, it is facially clear that only citizens may vote in elections within the state of New York,” Wilson wrote in the majority opinion. Judge Jenny Rivera, a Democrat appointed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2013, penned a dissent, arguing Article IX of the New York State Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law grant localities broad authority to structure their own governments and elections to enhance accountability and serve the unique needs of their residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5224" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/North-Carolina-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />North Carolina</strong>: Three Appeals Court judges will decide whether they </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2025/03/21/appeals-court-considers-whether-votes-in-nc-supreme-court-race-should-be-thrown-out/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">should order thousands of votes cast </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in November’s race for a seat on the state Supreme Court to be thrown out. Republican appeals court Judge Jefferson Griffin wants more than 60,000 votes in his race for the Supreme Court seat tossed. He is trailing Democratic incumbent Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs by 734 votes. Two recounts have affirmed her lead. Griffin believes he can win if he can convince courts to reject the votes he’s challenging. The state Board of Elections dismissed his protests in December. Griffin contends the elections board is counting illegal votes. His case against the elections board has traveled a tangled route through state and federal courts. A trial court judge’s decision in favor of the elections board teed up Griffin’s appeal. The case may yet make its way back to federal court.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Republican judges, John Tyson and Fred Gore, and one Democrat, Tobias Hampson, heard Griffin’s appeal on March 21.  Griffin is challenging three sets of ballots. He claims that more than 60,000 voters were not properly registered because they did not include either a partial Social Security number or driver’s license number on their forms. Voters Griffin is challenging have come forward in the past months to say they did provide that information, but it was excluded from the electronic voter file due to typos or data mismatches. The judges provided no indication as to when they will issue a ruling.</span></p>

Granteed, 68, of Plains Township has been </span><a href="https://www.citizensvoice.com/2025/03/26/plains-twp-man-charged-with-disrupting-election-board-meeting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">charged with assault and disorderly conduct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after allegedly scuffling with sheriff’s deputies after refusing to yield the lectern during last week’s Luzerne County Board of Elections meeting. Granteed was arrested on the misdemeanor charges following his alleged outburst around 7 p.m. March 19 at the Luzerne County Courthouse. According to the complaint, Granteed took the lectern during public comment and argued that elections should use only paper ballots and also began to “verbally assault” the board members. While asserting that the board’s existence is unconstitutional, Granteed exceeded his allotted three minutes at the microphone and became increasingly disruptive, according to the charges. Board Chairwoman Christine Boyle eventually ordered Granteed to leave the meeting, but Granteed continued acting out, the complaint says. While “unwillingly” returning to his seat, Granteed asserted that sheriff’s deputies lacked the authority to remove anyone from the meeting, the complaint alleges. Deputies charged Granteed with misdemeanor counts of simple assault, disrupting a public meeting and disorderly conduct, as well as two summary counts of harassment. Magisterial District Judge Donald L. Whittaker arraigned Granteed on the charges and set bail at $25,000, which court records show Granteed posted via a bondsman. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for April 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3609" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/TexasFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Texas:</strong> U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez has ruled that the state of Texas&#8217; I</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/21/texas-mail-ballot-voting-identification-requirement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">D requirements for mail ballot applications are unconstitutional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Rodriguez  found that the provisions in the state&#8217;s 2021 voter security law SB1 discriminate against voters with disabilities. Mail-in voters are principally people over the age of 65 and people with disabilities. Since the law was enacted, many voters reported having their ballots rejected because they didn’t provide an ID number, or the number they provided did not match the one the state had on file. The ruling ordered the Texas secretary of state to remove the requirements from mail-in ballot applications. However, the ruling came just weeks before Texas&#8217; municipal elections, so they will remain in effect through May 3. Rodriguez also struck down provisions of SB1 that require those who assist voters to swear an oath under penalty of perjury. The state of Texas was expected to appeal.</span></p>
