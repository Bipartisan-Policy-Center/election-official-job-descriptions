														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Voting should fit your life, not disrupt it</strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palm Beach County launches early voting appointment program</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They say that the waiting is the hardest part and in </span><a href="https://www.votepalmbeach.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palm Beach County, Florida</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where voting lines can reach a 3-hour wait time–in all sorts of weather–it can be particularly hard. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_12938" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12938" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-12938" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-05-at-11.06.09 AM-300x170.png" alt="" width="300" height="170" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-05-at-11.06.09 AM-300x170.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-05-at-11.06.09 AM-768x436.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-05-at-11.06.09 AM.png 938w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-12938" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Photo courtesy of WPTV.</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But thanks to an innovative early voting appointment program, voters in Palm Beach County don&#8217;t have to wait at all to cast their early ballots anymore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022 the county launched a first-in-the-nation early voting appointment program using </span><a href="https://www.nowaitinside.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Wait Inside</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology that became popular during the height of the pandemic. No Wait Inside is a virtual waiting room Cloud application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program allowed voters to make an appointment during a time window and at a location convenient for them, schedule an appointment online up to 30 days in advance, cancel the appointment at any time, receive text notifications about their upcoming appointment, and skip the line during their appointment window to vote quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program was made available to all voters regardless of their access to the internet, technology, or a mobile device. Voters can book an appointment via the county website but also over the phone with staff, in-person at any of the county elections offices, or at an Early Voting location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12939" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PBC1-268x300.png" alt="" width="268" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PBC1-268x300.png 268w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PBC1.png 740w" sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" />Appointments are 15-minute time windows where the voter can arrive at the polling location, skip the line, and vote at the time most convenient to them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During its first roll-out in 2022, more than 21,000 early voters utilized the system.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2022, we learned that appointment voting benefited a broad cross-section of voters — professionals, seniors, and those with mobility or time constraints,” explained Supervisor of Elections Wendy Sartory Link. “That insight shaped how we communicated the program’s value in 2024, focusing on how it meets real-life needs with flexibility and convenience.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usage nearly quintupled in 2024 compared to 2022. Several locations reached full appointment capacity during peak days. According to Sartory Link, voters embraced the opportunity to vote on their schedule, avoid lines, and skip unpredictable weather — especially during Florida’s  storm season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our appointment-based early voting system remained a standout success in 2024,” Sartory Link said. “We focused on expanding awareness and access, resulting in over 100,000 appointments made by voters across the county. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of the program include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduces long wait times;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minimizes voter scheduling conflicts;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitigates weather-related disruptions (critical during hurricane season);</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provides text reminders &amp; flexible scheduling for voter convenience;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengthens public trust and confidence in the voting process;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enables seamless mobile technology integration using QR codes &amp; online scheduling; and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voter data is secure; deleted after completion of appointment</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost depends on the number of locations and days of early voting. Key expenses include licensing fees, minimal hardware, and staffing. Each site needs a designated poll worker to oversee appointment check-ins, and all staff require brief training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The cost is modest relative to the gains realized from improved efficiencies and voter experience,” Sartory Link said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12940" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PBC2-300x177.png" alt="" width="300" height="177" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PBC2-300x177.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PBC2-1024x603.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PBC2-768x452.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PBC2.png 1104w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For those jurisdictions looking to implement their own appointment system, Sartory Link said they should assess their needs and explore available appointment-based tools — there are several vendors offering customizable options and Palm Beach moved to a new vendor after the launch. The key is finding a solution that integrates well with your workflow, is mobile-friendly, and doesn’t exclude voters without internet access. The Palm Beach system supports phone, in-person, and online scheduling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This program is more than just a tech upgrade — it builds voter confidence, reduces wait times, and supports a smoother, more predictable voting experience,” Sartory Link said. “For us, it’s another way of saying: voting should fit your life, not disrupt it.” </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Palm Beach County’s Revolutionizing Early Voting with Appointments received the 2024 Democracy Award for Best Practices from the Election Center.

														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-9614" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ElectionsOffice-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Federal Update</strong>: The fiscal 2026 budget proposal President Donald Trump unveiled last week would make deep cuts to the </span><a href="https://cyberscoop.com/trump-budget-proposal-would-slash-more-than-1000-cisa-jobs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CISA) workforce, with a goal of eliminating 1,083 positions and chopping its budget by $495 million, to $2.4 billion. The budget proposal includes the elimination of 14 election security positions. While there has been no official announcement, it appears that Maureen Riordan will be the new chief of the voting section at the </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/doj-top-voting-lawyer-worked-for-anti-voting-firm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She is currently serving in that role on an interim basis. Riordan previously spent nearly 17 years as a lawyer at the voting section, according to her LinkedIn bio. But from 2021 until this month, she served as litigation counsel at the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF). The Republican National Committee (RNC) </span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/rnc-intervenes-to-back-trump-anti-voting-order-claims-greater-voter-access-hurts-their-candidates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a motion this week to intervene in ongoing federal litigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Trump’s executive order  on voting. The motion places the RNC alongside the Trump administration in defending measures that would roll back mail-in voting, impose proof-of-citizenship requirements for voter registration and penalize states that don’t comply. “The RNC intervenes as a defendant in this case to vindicate its own rights and in a representational capacity to vindicate the rights of its members, affiliated voters, and candidates,” Michael Ambrosini, the RNC’s Chief of Staff, stated in a sworn declaration submitted with the motion. Ambrosini argued that expanded mail-in ballot access and insufficient voter roll maintenance harm Republican electoral prospects and drain critical party resources. One of its central claims is that mail ballots received after Election Day give Democrats a competitive edge. “Late-arriving ballots that skew heavily in favor of one party undermine confidence in the integrity of the election, dilute the timely votes of Republican voters, and harm the RNC,” the filing states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-9829" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/VanderburgCoIN-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Missing Ballot Update</strong>: Remember those </span><a href="https://www.courierpress.com/story/news/local/2025/06/02/missing-ballots-saga-in-vanderburgh-county-was-based-on-false-data/83918974007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 550 Vanderburgh County, Indiana mail-in absentee ballots that never showed up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after last year&#8217;s election? Turns out it was only 296, according to newly uncovered state data. With the same Statewide Voter Registration System data also showing 164 fewer ballots being mailed out than originally thought, the overall effect is to put the county&#8217;s return rate for mailed absentee ballots in 2024 at 95% — which is actually higher than 2016&#8217;s 94% and just behind 2020&#8217;s 96%. The new disclosures have forced a change in thinking about Vanderburgh County&#8217;s 2024 election among elections officials and rendered moot a mystery that only a week ago attracted the attention of a United States senator. In mid-November 2024, then-County Clerk Marsha Abell Barnhart told the Vanderburgh County Election Board that hundreds of mail-in absentee ballots were never returned. Barnhart said the notion that hundreds of people would request the ballots and then opt not to complete and return them was preposterous and she turned her suspicions on the U.S. Postal Service.  When current Clerk Dottie Thomas, pulled a new report from the SVRS in order to investigate further, she discovered an issue with the data. Thomas called SVRS, which explained that the earlier numbers cited by the county — and consequently by Banks — were based on hand-counts performed by Vanderburgh County Elections Office workers. Those counts were subject to human error and were compiled using methodology different from that used by SVRS. &#8220;Our tracking will be done differently,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I will be more in line with pulling SVRS data every day and to compare it to our data going in. That way, if there&#8217;s a discrepancy we can catch it from the beginning.&#8221;</span></p>

Upon completion, county officials said the building will double the county&#8217;s tabulation capacity, triple its warehouse space and improve the speed of getting election results. The facility will include centers to support in-person voting, observation viewing areas, a space for the media to conduct election coverage and an area to train election workers. The project will cost about $18 million. Officials say the </span><a href="https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2025/06/objections-to-elections-board-move-persist/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahoning County, Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Board of Elections needs a new home. Youngstown residents want to be certain it remains within the city limits. In November, Commissioners Carol Rimedio-Righetti and David Ditzler voted to buy the former Infocision building on Patriot Boulevard in Austintown for $2.5 million, to centralize some county offices that already operate outside the city. The Board of Elections, which many say needs to be moved out of Oak Hill Renaissance Place, is one being considered for the new building. But activists are concerned about moving the elections office out of Youngstown.

							<h2>Ballot Measures, Legislation & Rulemaking</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-6164" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Juneau-300x207.jpg" alt="" width="190" height="131" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Juneau-300x207.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Juneau.jpg 500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 190px) 100vw, 190px" />Juneau, Alaska</strong>: The Juneau Assembly is mulling over a plan to </span><a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2025/06/03/juneau-assembly-considers-ranked-choice-voting-system-for-local-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implement a ranked choice voting system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for local elections beginning next year. At a Committee of the Whole meeting this week, members unanimously forwarded</span><a href="https://mccmeetingspublic.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/juneauak-meet-07cc09b6d7d04ee1af21e7538ca32eb6/ITEM-Attachment-001-a1d446f0531043efac6dc8920cd191e4.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an ordinance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for public testimony and a vote on whether to implement the system.  Assembly member Ella Adkison proposed the ordinance. During a previous meeting, she said she thinks voters will support the change.  “I think that ranked choice voting, in this case, makes it a lot easier to build consensus in our community to fully express the nuances of every Juneauite’s vote,” she said. Assembly member Alicia Hughes-Skandijs said during Monday’s meeting that she supports the change, but wants to make sure there is enough opportunity for the public to weigh in. The city plans to do more public outreach before the Assembly’s final vote in late July.  “I love that we do ranked choice voting at the state. I love that we voted to keep it,” she said. “I don’t have a problem saying, ‘Yep, and this is how the state of Alaska votes, and this is how we vote locally, too.’”</span></p>

The legislation, which was approved by the Assembly and has headed to the state Senate, would also allow nonvoters to serve on paid recount boards. That has led some Republican legislators to say this would allow noncitizens to be hired to count votes.  While the bill would make counts more costly, it could also make them easier. Recount requesters would have the option to select the batch order in which the ballots are recounted, which could make it easier to ascertain whether the cost of the recount is worth sustaining. Assembly Bill 930, authored by Assemblyman Chris Ward, D-San Diego, would require the individuals or groups requesting the state’s rare recounts to pay each morning for each day of staffing the recount boards that count the votes. The legislation also removes the requirement that the recount boards, staffed by individuals appointed by the local elections official, have to be voters. According to an analysis of the bill by the Assembly Elections Committee, “This change appears to be consistent with other recent changes to the state’s elections laws that allowed non-voters (including individuals who are legal permanent residents and students who are not yet old enough to register to vote) to serve as elections workers at polling places and vote centers.” </span></p>

One measure would reform the entire Denver election system by adopting ranked-choice voting, a second measure would change how the city elects at-large council members. The two measures are being proposed by different council members, and could conflict with one another as written. Both would amend the city’s charter, which would require voter approval during the November election. Proponents of both measures argue they would give voters more choice and influence, though ranked-choice voting has been criticized as complex and confusing.  Both ideas were discussed at the city council’s Budget and Policy Committee this week. No actions were taken, but the sponsoring council members hope to pass the measures through council next month, in time to put the proposals on the November ballot.</span></p>

The bill gives the secretary of state’s office the ability to contract with federal and state agencies, and with private entities, for voter roll verification and maintenance, in addition to setting up a process for setting a voter’s registration status as “unconfirmed” when the state or county officials have received information from a “reliable source” that the person is not qualified to vote. The bill gives tools to election officials for voter eligibility verification before Election Day, but also allows registered voters to be challenged over their citizenship status at the polls. A challenged voter would have to present precinct election officials with evidence they are qualified to vote to cast a regular ballot. If the challenge is not withdrawn, they would cast a provisional ballot. The second measure,</span><a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.legis.iowa.gov%2Flegislation%2FBillBook%3Fba=HF928%26ga=91%26utm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/1/01000197317bb923-76d81af2-ba27-483a-9c10-9941ca065acc-000000/mpLGYdEabH1UhU3Rksq5Rq8vMtBID1Mh3k_zM69dNmU=407"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House File 928</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, makes changes to Iowa’s system for election recounts, including setting new limits on who can request recounts. For statewide and federal races, the election results would have to have a 0.15% difference in votes between candidates for a candidate to request a recount. For state legislative and local races, a difference of 1% or 50 votes would be required. This would stop recounts in future elections similar to those requested in recent elections, like the 2024 election recount for the race between U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Christina Bohannan, that was within 0.2%. The measure would also make changes to election recount boards. Under the previous system, each candidate in a recount designates one person to serve on the board, alongside a third person agreed upon by both candidates. The new law has county auditors lead election recount boards with their staff and hired election workers, adding the requirement that boards must have an equal numbers of workers from each political party. Candidates can choose up to five people to observe the recount process in each county.</span></p>

James DeSana (R-Carleton) called for the House to</span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2025/06/03/michigan-gop-house-members-call-for-impeachment-articles-against-secretary-of-state/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issue articles of impeachment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson – who is also a Democratic Party frontrunner for the 2026 gubernatorial primary. In calling for the impeachment, DeSana cited what he called unlawful election directives, a failure to preserve critical election records and supposed conduct that has undermined the public trust. Benson in a statement called the effort a “clown show.” The articles accuse Benson of exceeding her authority during her tenure by allegedly ignoring procedural requirements imposed by the Michigan Legislature through statute, her alleged donations to a political action committee in support of Michigan Supreme Court Justice Kyra Harris Bolden when she sought to retain her seat last year – allegedly just before her department’s attorneys argued before the high court in an election inspector challenge – and Benson’s office’s banning of firearms at polling locations. DeSana also said Benson’s office’s handling of absentee ballots during the 2020 presidential election was part of his calculus to call for her impeachment. In response, Benson said that she believes in oversight and transparency, but “this isn’t it.” “This is Republican lawmakers abusing their authority to access sensitive election information that would allow them – or any conspiracy theorists they share it with – to tamper with election equipment, interfere with the chain of custody of ballots, or impersonate a clerk on Election Day,” Benson said. “I continue to call on Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall and his caucus to work with us and a judicial mediator to help us reach a resolution to this matter.”</span></p>

Joe Lombardo to resurrect a vetoed effort to increase the number of ballot drop boxes in the days leading up to an election. The</span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25957595/ab499-r1-3114-v1-mockup-bigpdf.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, obtained by The Nevada Independent, is set to be introduced as an amendment to</span><a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/83rd2025/Bill/12768/Overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AB499</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an otherwise innocuous election bill related to the publication of a voter services portal on county clerks&#8217; websites. The prospective deal follows initial conversations between Democrats and the governor’s office and would mark a significant shift in Democrats’ stance on voter ID. The party previously argued that these requirements could disenfranchise low-income voters and even unsuccessfully sued to block a ballot question last year that more than 70 percent of voters later approved in the 2024 election. The language for the measure is based on feedback from local clerks and election officials, the operative said, adding that it’s designed to enable them to successfully implement identification and verification requirements. However, Douglas County Clerk Amy Burgans said in an email on Friday that county clerks did not learn of the amendment until after The Indy’s article was published, and that there are concerns with specific elements of the proposal. In a statement, Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, who has previously opposed voter ID requirements, said “voters made their voices heard at the ballot box supporting similar changes” and that he is “committed to ensuring that new laws are implemented without any unforeseen consequences that would limit the constitutional right to vote for our citizens.”</span></p>

The move came as the bill&#8217;s opponents organized a protest at the hearing, and as election law experts questioned whether the proposal would conflict with federal law. House Bill 127 would make it a crime for anyone except an election board employee or Division of Motor Vehicles employee to give someone a voter registration form. It would essentially ban voter registration drives by individuals or private groups, which could only hand out sample forms with instructions on where to find and fill out the real thing. Voter registration forms could only be accessed via elections offices or the state DMV. The measure was scheduled for a hearing in House Elections June 3 morning. But late June 2, as voting-rights groups organized a protest at the hearing, the committee meeting was cancelled. Committee leaders didn&#8217;t immediately respond to questions about the reason for the cancellation.</span></p>

That development in the waning days of the regular 2025 legislative session ending June 1 comes two years after the House voted to impeach Paxton on misconduct allegations that included bribery and abuse of office. The Senate later acquitted Paxton. </span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=HB5138"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 5138</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was filed by state Rep. Matt Shaheen, a Republican from North Texas. The Senate passed a version that would have given the attorney general’s office the power to unilaterally prosecute local election crimes when a county fails to do so. The House had previously agreed to grant Paxton’s office more powers to prosecute such cases, but only after local prosecutors considered the case. Shaheen filed the bill after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state’s highest criminal court, found Paxton’s office does not have authority to independently prosecute criminal election cases in trial courts without the request of a local prosecutor. Under the Senate’s version, local law enforcement would be required to send a report to the attorney general’s office if it believes there is probable cause to suspect that an election crime has been committed. The attorney general’s office would then have the authority to prosecute. Local prosecutors and law enforcement would be required to turn over any information they have about election crime investigations to the attorney general’s office. Under the House’s version of the bill, law enforcement agencies would be required to notify the attorney general’s office when reporting a potential election crime to local prosecutors. The attorney general could investigate only if the local prosecutor took no action on those reports for six months. And under the bill, local prosecutors could challenge the attorney general’s assertion of jurisdiction to investigate.</span></p>

To do that, the legislation would tweak state law by specifying that people who appeal WEC decisions in court will be considered to have standing, “regardless of whether the complainant has suffered an injury to a legally recognized interest.” State Rep. Robert Wittke, R-Caledonia, told WPR it’s an election integrity bill aimed at making those who file complaints with the elections commission “feel like they have had their complaint addressed.” He said while some may conclude it might create a situation where election complaints are appealed regardless of why the commission dismisses them, “maybe it will put both parties on equal footing.” “And maybe there will be a better chance that it’ll get resolved at that (commission) level rather than having to go to court,” Witke said.</span></p>

However, under the Wisconsin Elections Commission decision, those communities and all other Wisconsin towns, villages and cities must still comply with federal law and provide at least one electronic voting machine at a polling location to accommodate voters with disabilities. The commission’s decision came in reaction to a complaint against the northwestern Wisconsin town of Thornapple, population about 700, over its decision to hand count ballots in the April 2024 presidential primary or the August state primary. The decision also comes as a federal lawsuit over Thornapple’s decision not to have an accessible voting machine continues. A federal judge in October sided with the U.S. Department of Justice and ruled Thornapple was violating 2002’s Help America Vote Act, or HAVA. The judge ordered the town to offer disabled people accessible voting machines. An appeal by the town is pending. Under the commission’s decision, communities with fewer than 7,500 people can choose to have no other electronic vote-casting or tabulating machines other than one for disabled voters.</span></p>

The case involves the county’s May 2023 all-mail election on a proposed tax to fund construction of a new jail. The Arizona Court of Appeals found last year that the county erred by not sending ballots to its 11,000 inactive voters. Because of that error, the county supervisors’ plan to redo the election is reasonable and legal, Latham ruled May 22. Latham’s ruling did not directly void the results of the election, in which voters approved the jail tax by 750 votes out of 25,032 ballots cast. But it will effectively do so, by allowing county supervisors to move forward with a proposed settlement with the residents who challenged the result. In that settlement, the county agrees to stop collecting the tax, at least until a new election can be held. “The Court of Appeals already ruled that the election was fatally flawed due to the disenfranchisement of approximately 11,000 voters,” Latham wrote, finding that the settlement calling for a new election was a reasonable way for the parties to resolve that issue.</span></p>

Gould contends that Mayes constitutes a &#8220;real threat&#8221; to his powers and duties to certify elections simply because he believes that supervisors should be able to order a full hand count. But so far he has been unable to make his arguments after a trial judge last year tossed out his lawsuit, saying he has not shown any imminent threat of prosecution. Gould is asking the state Court of Appeals to issue a ruling declaring he does have a legal right to pursue the case and directing Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Bradley Astrowsky to let him present his evidence. The new bid is getting a fight from Assistant Attorney General Alexander Samuels. He is telling the appellate court that Gould&#8217;s claims are &#8220;speculative,&#8221; especially as he has &#8220;not articulated a concrete plan to violate the law&#8221; in the future. Samuels pointed out that state law requires the use of electronic tabulation of ballots, not the kind of hand count that Gould has pushed for in the past and may be seeking in the future. And he noted that Gould is not challenging the legality of that law but simply wants a declaration that he can&#8217;t be prosecuted for breaking it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton </span><a href="https://www.kjzz.org/politics/2025-06-03/judge-wont-toss-ruling-that-voided-law-designed-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-in-federal-races"><span style="font-weight: 400;">isn&#8217;t reversing her ruling </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that voided provisions of a 2022 law designed to require proof of citizenship to vote on federal races. In a new order, Bolton acknowledged that the federal government no longer wants any part of the lawsuit it filed against the state when Joe Biden was president to protect the rights of voters. She actually had issued a ruling finding some of what is in that law illegal, though there are still other legal issues to be resolved. But Bolton rejected a bid by the attorneys for the Department of Justice, now under President Donald Trump, to say she should vacate that judgment, at least as far the federal government is concerned, a move that would pave the way to dismiss all of the claims originally made against the state by the Biden administration. The problem with all that, the judge said, is the feds were just one of seven civil and voting rights groups who all challenged the laws. More to the point, those cases were consolidated. And her ruling finding the sections of the 2022 law illegal applied to that entire case. &#8220;Striking the listing of one of the seven cases listed as consolidated &#8230; would delete a fact not vacate a judgment,&#8221; Bolton wrote. &#8220;The United States improperly seeks to delete its lawsuit from the factual listing of the cases that were consolidated.&#8221; All of that means is that the judgment that the provisions of the 2022 are illegal remains valid. And that ruling also has been upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</span></p>

The Attorney General’s Office has been critical of the charter amendment since it was proposed. Approved by voters, the ordinance allows the city to require voters to present their identification at polling places in city elections as early as 2026. The notice of appeal filed moves the case forward to a state appeals court that will be fully briefed and consider arguments. “California’s elections are fair, safe and secure,” Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. “We respectfully ask the California Fourth District Court of Appeal to reverse the lower court’s decision and overturn Huntington Beach’s unlawful voter ID policy. State law supersedes local law when it comes to constitutional matters like the right to vote — and we will continue to fight to safeguard this fundamental right in court.” Voters approved Measure A in early 2024, and the city since has been defending it from a lawsuit brought by the state office.</span></p>

Crews said the penalty for such “keyboard terrorism” needed to be serious enough to deter others, particularly because threats against public officials are on the rise. People need to work out differences through the democratic process, not violence, Crews said. “The public must not accept this as the norm,” he said in handing down the sentence. Brockbank pleaded guilty in October to making threats between September 2021 and August 2022 against Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold and former Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who is now governor. He also threatened a Colorado judge overseeing his DUI case and threatened to kill any federal agents who came to his house. Before announcing the sentence, Crews read some of Brockbank’s threats, including descriptions of how officials should be killed. Crews said he believed Brockbank’s remorse was genuine and urged him to follow through with his decision to turn away from hate even though he was going to prison. </span></p>

Organizers of two separate campaigns had urged Walker to block implementation of parts of the law, arguing that the new requirements violate their First Amendment rights. But in an order issued this week, Walker granted a narrow injunction, barring state officials from enforcing one section of the law criminalizing ballot petition fraud against one campaign staffer. The order means that at least for now, the campaigns will largely have to operate under the new restrictions as they try to gather enough signatures to qualify for the 2026 ballot. Under Florida’s new law, an individual could be charged with a felony if they collect more than 25 signed ballot petitions, other than their own or those of immediate family members, and don’t register with the state as a petition circulator. The law signed last month by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis also gives campaigns just 10 days instead of the previous 30 to return signed petition forms to local elections officials. Petitioners could also face stiff fines if they don’t return the petitions on time, or send them to the wrong county. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacqueline Dianne Wallace, 52, a native of Jamaica, is facing a number of federal charges, including </span><a href="https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/bay-county/jamaican-woman-charged-with-voter-fraud-in-bay-county/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voter fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Bay County. Wallace was allegedly living in Panama City Beach in January 2024 when she registered online to vote. Authorities say she then voted in the August 2024 Presidential Primary. Bay County Sheriff’s deputies arrested Wallace on May 1. She was booked into the Bay County Jail with a hold for ICE. Jail officials say she’s no longer there. In a press release, Bay County Supervisor of Elections Nina Ward told News 13, “My office is fully committed to providing access to eligible voters however it is equally important to ensure the integrity of the voter rolls by removing those who are not eligible. We have fully cooperated with the Department of Homeland Security during this investigation and will continue to be vigilant in identifying and stopping voter fraud.”</span></p>

Republicans have been trying to end that practice − adopted by many states − through lawsuits and a March executive order from President Donald Trump that is being litigated. They argue that states are illegally extending the election beyond the date set by federal law. But when Rep. Michael Bost, R-Illinois, and two presidential electors tried to make that case, lower courts said they hadn’t been sufficiently harmed by the policy so they couldn’t sue. The Supreme Court on June 2 said it will decide if the lawsuit can move forward. The Chicago-based 7</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2024 dismissed Bost’s argument that he has to spend campaign funds to contest any objectionable ballots that come in after Election Day. Judge John Lee called it “speculative at best” that later ballots could cause him to lose an election, noting he won by 75% in the 2022 election. One of the three appeals court judges who ruled on the lawsuit said he would have let it proceed.</span></p>

Smith, 67, an attorney from Peoria, </span><a href="https://www.centralillinoisproud.com/news/local-news/peoria-man-voting-fraud-indicted/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">faces up to five years in prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after being indicted this week for voting more than once. A no-bond, no-extradition warrant was issued for Smith. He’s accused of voting more than once in the April 1 general election. He allegedly “after having voted once, knowingly accepted another ballot.” According to Anna Perales of the State’s Attorney’s office, Smith voted using a mail-in ballot and on April 1, when he arrived at his polling place, an election judge’s computer indicated he had already gotten mail-in ballot. “Despite this, Smith signed a form stating that he had not previously voted and proceeded to submit a second provisional ballot,” Perales said. “Processes in place through the Election Commission noted this second illegal ballot, and it was not counted in the final certified election results.”</span></p>

Gao admitted during the conversation with the school that he registered to vote and did cast a vote at a polling location on campus on Oct. 27. He was charged by the state on Oct. 30 with one count each of unauthorized elector attempting to vote and making a false affidavit for the purpose of securing voter registration, court records show. During Gao&#8217;s arraignment, a judge ordered him to surrender his Chinese passport and not to leave Michigan, according to the criminal complaint. The passport handed in had a serial number ending in &#8220;1332.&#8221; A warrant for Gao was later issued after he missed court hearings on March 6 and April 24. The FBI said in the filing that Gao&#8217;s passport was in the possession of school safety officials during a court hearing. However, according to prosecutors, Gao boarded a Delta flight from Detroit International Airport to Shanghai, China, on Jan. 19 using a Chinese passport in his name with a serial number ending in &#8220;7137.&#8221;</span></p>

In 2024, a trial court in Strafford County ruled against Dover and Rochester, agreeing with the state and Scanlan that creating maps where every city, town, or ward with the necessary population had their own districts would be impossible to accomplish. It also ruled previous case law determined that presumptive violations of the one-person-one-vote requirement may be justified by efforts to make districts compact, respect municipal boundaries, preserve the cores of prior districts, and avoid contests between incumbent representatives. Dover, Rochester, and the rest of the plaintiffs promptly appealed the ruling and the state Supreme Court considered the case. On June 4, the Supreme Court ruled that because they did not sufficiently show that the Legislature had “no rational or legitimate basis” to enact the map, they denied the appeal.</span></p>

These cases were identified through an ongoing review of Ohio’s voter registration database by the secretary’s Election Integrity Unit, which uses state and federal data to flag potential violations. The cases flagged Tuesday include 11 potential instances of double-voting across multiple states, and 30 potential noncitizen voter registrations in Ohio, according to LaRose’s office. LaRose’s office has previously referred hundreds of potential voter fraud cases, though conviction rates have remained very low.

And it called for the withholding of federal election funds from the state. In a letter released this week by the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, officials charged that the Wisconsin Elections Commission “has refused to provide any administrative complaint process or hearing regarding HAVA complaints against the Commission.” A complaint process would likely make it easier for activists or officials to pressure the state to enforce stricter rules around the information voters must provide when registering to vote. The DOJ emphasized that compliance with HAVA is mandatory and that the receipt of federal funds under the act is conditioned on such compliance. “Your actions justify a bar against the Wisconsin Elections Commission receiving any future funding from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission,” the letter states. Wisconsin received more than $77 million in HAVA-related support to date, according to the letter.  “We have made it our highest priority to identify jurisdictions that fail to follow our elections laws and vigorously enforce the law by all means available,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said in a statement. </span></p>
