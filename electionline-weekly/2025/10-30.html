														<p><strong>National Conference highlights proposals for innovative funding solutions for U.S. election</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By </span><a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/directory/mitchell-brown"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell Brown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Auburn University and<br />
</span><a href="https://bush.tamu.edu/soren-jordan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soren Jordan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Texas A&amp;M University</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of years of controversy over adequate funding of U.S. elections, Auburn University hosted their biennial symposium October 26</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – 28</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to highlight innovative funding proposals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13662" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Symposium2025-234x300.png" alt="" width="234" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Symposium2025-234x300.png 234w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Symposium2025.png 589w" sizes="(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px" />For three days, the </span><a href="https://www.au-elections.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Election Administration Research &amp; Practice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a collaboration of Auburn University and the </span><a href="https://electioncenter.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Center </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(National Association of Election Officials), highlighted innovative funding solution proposals based on the contest challenge they ran over the summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge was designed to encourage creative thinking and collaboration in developing new approaches to election funding. Proposals were reviewed and scored on the basis of clear identification of the problem they were trying to solve, development of a creative or innovative solution that reflects the legal and practical realities of US election administration, sophistication of understanding of the connection between the problem and solution, analysis of financial impact, practical and political feasibility of the solutions, and generalizability of the solution for diffusion. Proposals were accepted that focused on local solutions, state solutions, and national solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference featured keynote presentations by </span><a href="https://sos.ga.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://azsos.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, presentations of the top ten proposals from the contest, and discussion of other novel ideas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary Raffensperger focused his comments on building trust back into elections and the importance of funding, integrity, and training. He noted the importance of investing in election administration and office infrastructure and people in order to be able to ensure integrity in the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary Fontes also focused his remarks on building back trust and cycles of trust and distrust in the system, noting that we have had other low points in implementing democracy across our nation’s history. He also noted the importance of election officials needing to push and lead in their counties to bolster their IT and security infrastructures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference was structured around the presentation of the top ten ideas from the contest. These included (in order of presentation) creating special districts; utilizing unclaimed funds; developing endowments; federal funding for all jurisdictions by charging for ballot real estate for federal races; raising funds with special license plates; using ballot qualification fees; using a portion of the federal </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/highwaytrustfund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highway Trust Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for state DMV and registration systems; using a portion of the federal telecommunications access funds to support cybersecurity and infrastructure; creating an election infrastructure checkoff program to fund infrastructure improvements; tying mandatory community service requirements for college student recipients of state grant aid; adding photo ID fees to support local election offices; and creating an election advertising tax to support election administration.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A panel of national experts ranked the presentations, and contest winners included:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expert panelists included Cathy Darling Allen, Karen Brinson-Bell, Mitchell Brown, Donetta Davidson, Bob Fincher, John Fortier, Matt Germer, Adam Hinds, Pete Lichtenheld, Paul Lopez, Justin Marlowe, John Merrill, Don Palmer, Justin Ross, David Stafford, Charles Stewart, Keely Varvel, Matt Weil, Tom Wilkey, and Kim Wyman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the presentations, meeting attendees participated in facilitated small group discussions about how to move from ideas to implementation. Discussions focused on creating pilot programs for proof of concept, the need for cost data for better advocacy, shared messaging and storytelling, aligning incentives of and coordinating across stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Wilkey, chair of the Election Center board of directors and former executive director of the </span><a href="https://www.eac.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, noted about the symposium that “it is cutting edge events like this that set the Election Center apart from other election organizations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On behalf of the Institute, we express our deep appreciation for the important collaboration between Auburn and the Election Center, as well as to the </span><a href="https://www.electioninitiative.org/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election Trust Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which funded this event. Not least, we thank all of the participants in the contest for their time and careful attention to developing thoughtful proposals, and their consideration of the underlying issues critical to the success of American democracy. And perhaps most importantly, a highlight of the event was student engagement in the contest, supporting the program, and attending and participating in the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next year, Auburn and the Election Center will be rolling out a series of toolkits, resources, and presentations that bring these innovations home to local communities and offices. They will also collaborate with organizations across the election administration space to help further disseminate and further develop these ideas. In December, the full version of each proposal will be published alongside comments from members of the expert panel in a special issue of the Journal of Election Administration Research &amp; Practice.

Under the proposal, the federal government would both verify voter identity and check citizenship against a system run by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security before making the applications available to states. The proposal — discussed on recent calls between the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, federal officials working to design the new tool, and state officials — would for the first time allow the federal voter registration form to be filed online. Notes summarizing an October 17 call for members of the National Association of State Election Directors said association members “representing states of both parties expressed serious concerns with this project not complying with state law” and also that “the developers do not seem to want to spend the time to understand election official concerns.” Camden Kelliher, the EAC’s general counsel, told attendees on the Oct. 17 call that the online form, which would require the additional verification steps, would not replace the existing paper version, according to notes summarizing the call, but would provide voters a new way to fill it out. Schletz noted that the online tool would need disclaimer language about those steps “as well as to accommodate usage of SAVE.”  The federal government’s goal is to modernize the form and make it easier to use, said Akash Bobba, the federal developer who spoke on an October 23 call organized by the National Association of Secretaries of State, according to the recording. Election officials who heard the proposal for the online voter registration form asked numerous questions about how it would align with state laws, according to the recording and notes. They also pressed for details about the new tool, many of which Bobba and EAC officials said they couldn’t immediately provide, according to the recording and notes</span></p>

Dhillon of the Civil Rights Division said in a </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-monitor-polling-sites-california-new-jersey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Transparent election processes and election monitoring are critical tools for safeguarding our elections and ensuring public trust in the integrity of our elections.” The department&#8217;s announcement</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/doj-election-monitors-new-jersey-california-voting-30d355a9ced990218772eeff1b6642b3"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came after Republican party officials in both states asked for help </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitoring the elections. While the Department routinely monitors elections, leaders in California and New Jersey decried the decision. &#8220;He wants to suppress the vote,&#8221; California Gov. GavinNewsom posted on social media. &#8220;And when we win, he will falsely lay claim to fraud. We will not be intimidated. California will defend free and fair elections.&#8221; New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin, a Democrat, said in a </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/24/department-of-justice-monitoring-elections-california-new-jersey/86888783007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement to USA TODAY </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that the Justice Department&#8217;s monitoring of Passaic County&#8217;s election is &#8220;highly inappropriate.&#8221; &#8220;Our State is committed to ensuring a free, fair, and secure election, and we will not allow anyone to interfere with or disrupt our elections,&#8221; Platkin said. &#8220;DOJ has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions. The Constitution gives states, not the federal government, the primary responsibility for running elections, and our state’s hardworking elections officials have been preparing for months to run a safe and secure election. We are committed to ensuring that every eligible voter is able to cast their ballot and make their voices heard, and we are considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13645" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/KnoxCoOHVOTER-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Rapid Response</strong>: Last week, the Knox County Board of Elections launched</span><a href="https://www.knoxpages.com/2025/10/27/knox-county-launches-ohios-first-mobile-rapid-response-election-support-vehicle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ohio’s first mobile command-and-support unit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to maintain uninterrupted operations on Election Day. The V.O.T.E.R (Voter Onsite Tech Emergency Response) vehicle carries essential tools and systems to support polling sites in crisis. “This is something new and something really special for our county,” Board of Elections Director James Blazer told the Knox Pages. “It’s the only one of its kind in the state of Ohio. We’ve informed the Secretary of State. He’s very excited about it and what it will enable us to do.” The VOTER vehicle is a partnership between the BOE and the Knox County Veterans Service Office. “They purchased a van earlier in the year which has a generator on board. It’s a mobile office for when they go to the fair or they go to different events,” Blazer explained. “We’re using that, and repurposing it and rebranding it for Election Day. The idea is that we will put some of our equipment on the van and be prepared in case a precinct goes down.” The VOTER vehicle carries voting equipment, emergency communication devices, backup power, logistical supplies, and technical troubleshooting capabilities. It is set up to handle ballots across all precincts. “So if a precinct goes down for a gas leak or whatever the case may be, loss of electricity, we will be able to take this and bring it out. It has generators on board, and we can just set up another precinct no matter where we need it to be set up,” Blazer said. On Monday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he would bring in </span><a href="https://sfist.com/2025/10/27/now-california-will-bring-in-state-election-monitors-to-monitor-trumps-federal-election-monitors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state election monitors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to monitor the federal election monitors. “They’re not going to be allowed to interfere in ways that the law prohibits,” Bonta said during a news conference. “We cannot be naive. The Republican Party asked for the US DOJ to come in.” </span></p>

Votebeat’s Hayley Harding </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/2025/10/27/athens-county-board-of-elections-pumpkin-cat-ohio-university/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">checked in with the Athens County, Ohio board of elections to see how Pumpkin, the office cat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since 2012, is doing. Now about 14½, Pumpkin spends less time in the front window and more time under office desks, but he’s still keeping a watchful eye over things in Athens County. We first wrote about Pumpkin all the way back in </span><a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2017/10-26/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We also reached out to former director Debbie Quivey when she announced her retirement to see if Pumpkin would be retiring with her. “Pumpkin will be staying at the office,” she wrote. “That has been his home since 2012. I would love to take him but I have an inside Lab that I’m positive Pumpkin would not like. The staff there will take good care of him. I will visit him.” According to Harding, who got to know Pumpkin as a college student in Athens, his visage appears on T-shirts and posters encouraging people to vote. The university has even used pictures of Pumpkin to encourage students to “take the Bobcat voter pledge.” People regularly stop by the office to ask about him and occasionally make art dedicated to him. “There’s a lot of people that will ask us to use his likeness and things like that. We don’t limit his likeness or anything,” Tony Brooks, director of the Athens County Board of Elections, told Harding. The board even took a vote against limiting the use of his likeness or seeking to profit from it. Brooks told Harding that having, what we all believe to be the only cat supervising elections in Ohio for sure, the country maybe, is no extra pressure, although people are sometimes disappointed when they come in to meet him during a busy election season and instead have to come back when his caretakers are less occupied with the business of democracy.</span></p>

The recognition ceremony celebrated the creativity, leadership, and civic spirit of the young artists, participants in the Girl Goals summer program, a civic engagement initiative for Paterson girls in kindergarten through eighth grade. “It is my honor to welcome you to this very special recognition ceremony,” Shona Mack-Pollock, Superintendent of Elections, said. “Tonight, we gather to celebrate the creativity, talent, and civic spirit of an exceptional group of students whose designs were chosen for our county’s new ‘I Voted’ stickers.” This past summer, 35 girls from Paterson participated in educational workshops hosted by the Superintendent of Elections’ office, where they learned about voting and the election process before creating their own sticker designs. Afterward, the designs were narrowed down to finalists across three age groups. The participants then cast their votes using real voting machines to choose the winning artwork. “When the girls were done, my staff and I were completely blown away by their artwork,” Mack-Pollock said. “It was such an enriching day, and we were truly honored to provide the girls with their first experience in the lifelong journey of civic engagement.”</span></p>

She was 83. According to Rodger McDaniel, a friend and political colleague of 50 years, Karpan had been battling cancer for months and lived longer than doctors expected. “But that would be Kathy,” he said. “Tough as nails.” Karpan served two terms as Wyoming Secretary of State from 1987 &#8211; 1995. “I think people should know how committed she was to Wyoming,” said McDaniel. “She was involved politically in so many ways to try to make a difference. And (she was) one of the brightest people I’ve ever met.” Former Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan, also a Democrat, was elected and re-elected to office at the same time as Karpan and they served eight years together. Sullivan told Cowboy State Daily that it was his privilege to serve with her. &#8220;Kathy was a force,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;She loved the State and its people and worked tirelessly on their behalf. Kathy was a true daughter of Wyoming with her feet solidly planted in politics.&#8221;  Karpan was born Sept. 1, 1942, in Rock Springs. Karpan served as the editor of the University of Wyoming’s student paper, The Branding Iron, then graduated with a degree in journalism. She landed her first journalism job at the Cody Enterprise, and a later job at a newspaper in Canberra, Australia. Karpan earned her master’s degree in American Studies, then a law degree from the University of Oregon in 1978. She served as acting deputy legal counsel in the Economic Development Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce. Karpan later landed a job in the Wyoming Attorney General’s Office, then directed the Wyoming Department of Health. She ran successfully for the Wyoming secretary of state’s seat in 1986. When she ran again in 1990, she carried every county against her Republican opponent.</span></p>

							<h2>Ballot Measures, Legislation & Rulemaking</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8836" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ShastaCoCA-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Shasta County, California Ballot Measure</strong>: An election ballot measure proposed by five Shasta County residents </span><a href="https://www.redding.com/story/news/2025/10/27/same-day-voting-other-changes-now-up-to-shasta-county-voters/86876729007/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to change voting rules has gotten enough verified signatures </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and will be placed on the ballot. The proposed measure calls for elections to take place only on Election Day with limited absentee voting, to have lottery-selected volunteers hand count all ballots at the precincts, to require people to present voter identification in order to vote and calls for the creation of a new voter roll. Shasta County Clerk and Registrar of Voters Clint Curtis said Friday, Oct. 24 that enough signatures were found to be valid through a statistical sampling method to place the item before voters. When the proposed measure will be on the ballot is up to the Shasta County Board of Supervisors, said Curtis. He said the earliest the new measure could be included on the Shasta County ballot would be the June 2, 2026 statewide primary. The board could approve calling a special election on the question to be held before then. Shasta County Counsel Joseph Larmour had said the changes in the proposed ballot measure would violate the state and federal constitutions and other state and federal legislation. In March, the county reiterated with a statement saying such a proposal &#8220;raised concerns that the measure conflicts with state and federal laws, including the California Constitution, the California Elections Code, the Help America Vote Act, and the National Voter Registration Act.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4121" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Louisiana-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Louisiana</strong>: Lawmakers convened this week for a special session to a</span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2025/10/23/louisiana-election-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">djust the state’s 2026 election calendar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Republicans want to account for a pending U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a case that could reshape Louisiana’s six congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections. The front-running proposals from the Republican-run legislature – House Bill 1 and identical Senate Bill 1 – push next year’s primary schedule back by roughly one month. The Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee advanced the Senate Bill 1 to the floor in an 5-3 party-line vote. The start of the three-day qualifying period for the election gets shifted from Jan. 14 to Feb. 11 in the bills Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, R-Port Allen, and Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, have co-authored. Both lead their respective chamber’s legislative committees that handle election proposals. Procedural efforts from Democrats in both chambers failed to keep the bills from being moved to their committees. The panel also approved Senate Bill 2, which moves the election date for five constitutional amendments from the April 18 ballot to May 16. The </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2025/10/29/louisiana-election-dates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">date changes lawmakers approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a 73-29 vote move next year’s primary election schedule back roughly one month. Instead of an April 18 party primary for Louisiana’s congressional races and some municipal elections, the new date would be May 16. Primary runoffs would be moved from May 30 to June 2.  The qualifying period for the election would be adjusted from Jan. 14-16 to Feb. 11-13. A separate measure lawmakers approved moves five state constitutional amendments and local propositions on the March ballot to the new April date.  The Secretary of State would need the legislature to provide a new congressional district map by Jan. 13 in order for her office to hold the qualifying period a month later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13351" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Annapolis-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Annapolis, Maryland:</strong> The Annapolis City Council will not consider switching to </span><a href="https://www.capitalgazette.com/2025/10/27/annapolis-city-council-tables-ranked-choice-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked choice voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its final meeting ahead of November’s city elections, adding to a list of controversial items tabled in the last few weeks of the mayor and council term. The ranked choice voting plan, introduced by Ward 1 Alderman Harry Huntley, would have switched the city’s local election system as of the 2029 primaries for city alderman and mayor. Huntley confirmed to the Capital Gazette that he would be tabling the agenda item during October 27th’s City Council meeting. He said he wanted to give more opportunity for the city’s Board of Supervisors of Elections and the city’s Rules and Government Committee to provide input on the legislation. “Unfortunately, it was too ambitious to try to significantly change our elections while our election staff and volunteers—not to mention the council—were all busy with running elections. We have been working for many months on getting the details of this right, and the clock is just going to run out,” Huntley wrote in his newsletter. Huntley said he plans to reintroduce a more streamlined version of the legislation early in the next council term if reelected, a position that was lauded by a proponent group. The bill drew vocal support and opposition at a recent meeting, where most attendees argued that the change would give voters more choice in city elections, but a smaller contingent of critics said it could be confusing to some voters.</span></p>

Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), the Senate majority floor leader, plans to introduce legislation within two weeks to</span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/michigan/2025/10/29/change-primary-elections-august-february-school-boards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> move Michigan’s August primary to May</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with some May races potentially shifting to February. The changes would take effect in 2027, Singh said, potentially eliminating concerns Republicans in the House expressed about disrupting the 2026 election cycle. Because many campaigns are “up and running,” Singh told Votebeat in an interview last week, making changes in the middle of a cycle “was a significant concern.” If the proposal becomes law, the general-election period would effectively be stretched out by three months each year. Meanwhile, clerks around the state would see a big shift in their election calendar — but it’s not the one they want. Clerks say they want just two elections a year: one in May or June and one in November. The Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks’ official stance is that Michigan doesn’t need three elections each year. Keeping all three, regardless of the timing, is expensive for local governments, said Michael Siegrist, the Canton Township clerk and first vice president of the local clerks association. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly two dozen House Republicans have signed on to a resolution calling for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/michigan/2025/10/28/house-resolution-voter-roll-benson-gop-joe-fox-justice-department/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">share the state’s complete voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Trump administration, without redactions of potentially sensitive identifying information. The GOP-backed resolution, which was debated at a hearing in the House Election Integrity Committee, calls for the secretary of state to share an unredacted copy of Michigan’s computerized statewide voter registration list, also known as the qualified voter file, with federal officials. “It is inconceivable, in fact unconscionable, that the chief election officer in Michigan refuses to comply with our nation’s top law enforcement official,” Rep. Joe Fox, a Republican from Fremont and the sponsor of the resolution, said at the hearing. “Who does she think she is?” When questioned by Rep. Stephen Wooden, D-Grand Rapids, Fox appeared unaware that the state had already submitted a redacted voter roll to the Justice Department, saying he was “maybe one of the most confused.” After Wooden provided the date that the file was submitted, Fox said he’d look into it. The committee approved the resolution 6-3 along party lines.</span></p>

Kelly Ayotte’s veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a bill that would have expanded the prohibition on electioneering by public employees. In vetoing</span><a href="https://gc.nh.gov/bill_status/legacy/bs2016/billText.aspx?sy=2025&amp;id=1070&amp;txtFormat=html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Bill 213</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ayotte said she would be interested in working on strengthening the anti-electioneering law, but pointed to an unrelated section in the bill focused on absentee voting that clashes with a different bill signed into law this year. The Senate unanimously voted to sustain the veto. SB 213 would have built upon the current ban on electioneering by laying out specific activities that public employees cannot do, as well as those that they can. Current law defines electioneering as a public employee acting “in any way specifically designed to influence the vote of a voter on any question or office” while in the performance of their official duties, but it does not specify those activities.  The bill states that the prohibition on electioneering includes a public employee distributing or displaying campaign materials, making public statements for or against a candidate, organizing surveys, forums, or events that are political, and using their authority to influence or interfere with a voter’s decision. “I am vetoing this legislation as it conflicts with other bills I have recently signed into law regarding absentee ballots,” Ayotte wrote in her veto message Aug. 1. “Additionally, I intend to work with the bill sponsors on the issue of electioneering to ensure that public employees can engage in public discourse without misusing their official positions for political purposes.” SB 213 is the only Senate bill vetoed by Ayotte this year. Under the state constitution, all vetoed bills return first to the legislative chamber in which they originated, and if that chamber votes by a two-thirds majority to overturn the veto, the other chamber also takes it up for a vote. </span></p>

According to the Oklahoma Voice, at least three county election boards – Oklahoma, Tulsa and Cleveland – plan to open additional locations, the legislative panel was told. Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, oversaw an interim study on the issue. Interim studies often help lawmakers craft legislation for the upcoming session. Boren said knew of two instances during the 2024 presidential election in which some Cleveland County voters were told early voting had closed when time still remained to cast ballots. County election officials did the best with the hand they were dealt, State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax said. Ziriax said he doesn’t want people to wait in long lines, but it comes down to resources, time, money, people and locations. While some of the resources can come from the Legislature, a lot has to come from the county government, he said.</span></p>

Supporters are aiming to get the measure on the November 2026 ballot, said A.J. Griffin, a former Republican state senator who is volunteering. If approved by voters, all candidates for an office would appear on a single primary ballot. Every voter, regardless of party registration, could participate. The top two finishers, regardless of partisan affiliation, would advance to the general election. Critics have said the measure forces political parties to unwillingly associate with political candidates in violation of the First Amendment. Oklahoma law allows recognized political parties the option to open their primaries to independent voters. Currently, Democrats have opened their primaries to independent voters, but Republicans and Libertarians have not.

Two new initiatives recently filed would let voters consider whether to amend the state law and the state’s constitution and open primaries to all voters. </span><a href="https://egov.sos.state.or.us/elec/web_irr_search.record_detail?p_reference=20260055..LSCYYY."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initiative 55</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would amend the state constitution to get rid of partisan primaries.

The same three people are backing both initiatives and are calling the two the “Voters Fairness Act.” To qualify for the November 2026 ballot, petitioners will need to collect 156,000 signatures to amend the constitution to enact a top two primary system and 117,000 to change the state law to open up party primaries. Former Democratic Gov. Ted Kulongoski is one of the chief petitioners, along with former state Rep. Cheri Helt, R-Bend, and Andrew Kaza, who is the co-chair of the state Independent Party of Oregon. “When this is on the ballot, half of the people in the state will be neither Democrats or Republican registered. And I think that the party should have to make an appeal to those independents as to why they think their candidate is the best one,” Kulongoski said.</span></p>

According to Votebeat, the amendment wouldn’t have much practical effect, as it essentially restates what’s already in state law. But it would “make it crystal clear under the state constitution that if you’re not a U.S. citizen you’re not allowed to vote in Texas,” Gov. Greg Abbott said. An effort to require all Texas to show proof of citizenship to register to vote failed to pass in the legislature this year. Constitutional amendments are the only state measures voters in Texas will see on their ballot this year. They will appear at the top of the ballot and above any local races or measures. It was introduced as</span><a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/billtext/html/SJ00037S.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate Joint Resolution 37</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and written by Sen. Brian Birdwell, a Republican from North Texas. The Legislature approved its addition to the ballot during the regular session. It says, “the constitutional amendment clarifying that a voter must be a United States citizen.” It would amend Article 6 of the Texas Constitution, which lists groups that aren’t allowed to vote in Texas. Article 6 currently prohibits voting by people under 18 years old; anyone who has been deemed incompetent by a court; and anyone who has been convicted of a felony. The proposed amendment would add to that list “persons who are not citizens of the United States.”</span></p>

The 3–4 vote followed concerns about creating another elected position, increasing government size and cost, and the risk of electing an unqualified auditor, despite Woytek’s assurances that the change would improve efficiency at little or no added expense. Woytek, who has served as clerk-auditor since 2022, said the growing size and complexity of county government has made the dual role difficult to manage. He said the separation would help strengthen oversight and make both offices more effective. In a written response to The Times-Independent, Woytek said many clerk-auditors across Utah face similar pressures balancing financial oversight and elections, and that despite the commission’s decision, he remains committed to the work. If approved, the offices would have separated in January 2027, following the 2026 election cycle. Woytek said he intended to run for clerk, leaving the auditor seat open. The change, he argued, would let each office focus on its core duties — elections and record-keeping for the clerk, and budgeting and financial oversight for the auditor — while keeping both accountable to voters. </span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates This Week</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Arizona</strong>: The Arizona Court of Appeals has ruled that</span><a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/appeals-court-says-the-government-cant-sue-people-for-requesting-public-records/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preemptive lawsuits against public records requesters </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">are not the way to solve questions about whether documents are legally public records. The case originated in 2022, after Audit USA requested several primary election records from Santa Cruz County, including its cast vote record, the electronic documentation of each ballot cast in an election and all the votes on those ballots.  Maricopa, Pima and Santa Cruz counties had previously released their cast vote records — which contain huge amounts of data that would be difficult for laypeople to parse — to election data analysts. But the counties later ended that practice after a huge increase in requests for the cast vote record following unfounded claims of voter fraud in 2020 and 2022, saying that releasing the cast vote record violated voter privacy laws. While the record includes every vote cast on every ballot in the election, it does not identify individual voters or how they voted. Santa Cruz County’s lawsuit, filed weeks after the county agreed to provide the cast vote record to Audit USA, attempted to force the courts to decide on the county’s behalf whether the cast vote record was legally a public record. The lack of clarity in the law has been a source of debate for years, but in July a Maricopa County judge ruled that public records laws do not require counties to release the cast vote record. That decision was appealed in September but is still awaiting a hearing.  Judge Peter Eckerstrom said that if the courts allowed government entities to sue people or groups simply because they requested public records, that could have a chilling effect on requesters who don’t have the means to defend themselves in court. In the unanimous Oct. 20 decision, Eckerstrom wrote that lawsuits like the one brought by Santa Cruz County must focus on “specific adverse claims, based upon present rather than future or speculative facts.”</span></p>

Sarah Huckabee Sanders to set an earlier date for the Senate District 26 special election, following a successful lawsuit by Franklin County resident Colt Shelby. Shelby, who lives in the Cecil community, sued the governor and secretary of state to ensure an election date is set before lawmakers return to Little Rock for the fiscal session. The Franklin County clerk told 40/29 News that her office can accommodate any election day as long as they have at least 60 days to prepare, but the governor is currently appealing the latest court ruling.</span></p>

In his ruling, Chapman said granting the TRO would require him to rule on the underlying case that DuPage County Clerk Jean Kaczmarek brought against the county. In that case, Kaczmarek argues the county cannot prevent her from procuring services or equipment needed to run her office. “TROs are not designed to address the merits in the underlying case,” Chapman said. Chapman’s ruling comes two months after a decision directing the county clerk’s office to comply with the county’s accounting procedures on budget line-item transfers for bill payments. The two bills in question prompted the DuPage County state’s attorney’s office to request a special prosecutor to conduct an investigation to determine if the clerk’s office violated the state’s competitive bidding laws and if any criminal charges, including official misconduct, are warranted. The Illinois attorney general’s office was appointed to investigate, but has not yet released a ruling.</span></p>

The lawsuit, which was filed October 23, accuses Missouri lawmakers of trying to trick voters by writing an intentionally deceptive summary that includes so-called “ballot candy” — three provisions vowing to enact things that are already part of state law, such as a ban on foreign campaign contributions.  The first three bullet points of the summary make no mention of the proposal’s main purpose, which is to require constitutional amendments put on the ballot by voters to obtain both a simple majority statewide and a majority in all eight congressional districts to pass. Currently, constitutional amendments only require a simple majority statewide.  “The General Assembly elected to include these provisions in bullet points one, two, and three to conceal the central purpose,” the lawsuit states, “which is to limit citizens’ ability to approve citizen-led initiative petitions to amend the constitution.”</span></p>

Moorhead was ordered to pay a $310 penalty, and under the state constitution, his right to vote in New Hampshire is terminated unless it is restored by the state Supreme Court. The Election Law Unit led the investigation into the missing political signs, along with the Northfield Police Department. </span></p>

The complaint focuses on an Open Public Records Act request for video footage of a Moorestown ballot drop box for a 10-day period in June. It also seeks chain-of-custody logs and ballot storage container opening logs. The RNC says the Burlington County Board of Elections delayed providing the documents and denied having video footage of the Moorestown ballot drop box, according to the complaint. “The RNC’s party members, and any member of the public, have the right to know the information contained on the chain of custody logs,” the complaint states. “No known state interest outweighs the right of the RNC to obtain this basic-level due diligence information.” “The timing of this complaint seems intended to garner headlines and impact voter participation rather than improve election transparency,” Dave Levinsky, spokesperson for Burlington County, said in a statement. “As the pleadings show, this complaint relates to an OPRA request from the primary election and completely ignores the independent special counsel’s review and report and the significant measures Burlington County election offices have taken to ensure election integrity and unfettered, equal access for all voters.”</span></p>

She’s accused of </span><a href="https://kfor.com/news/oklahoma-legislature/oklahoma-woman-faces-felony-charge-for-voter-fraud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">casting multiple ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the November 2024 general election. According to the Oklahoma State Election Board, Vincenza Dill allegedly voted in person in Oklahoma County while also submitting an absentee ballot in Payne County on the same day.  “The integrity of our elections is fundamental to ensuring every vote counts,” said Attorney General Gentner Drummond. “Every illegal vote cancels out a legitimate voter’s voice and undermines public confidence in our elections. My office will continue to investigate voter fraud and hold accountable those who violate Oklahoma’s election laws.”  If convicted, Dill faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and/or a fine of up to $50,000. ]</span></p>

The charges stem from a voter registration drive leading up to the 2024 election, in which a state coordinator offered illegal financial incentives to canvassers who then fabricated voter information to meet quotas. “We are confident that the motive behind these crimes was personal financial gain, and not a conspiracy or organized effort to tip any election for any one candidate or party,” Attorney General Dave Sunday said in a press release.  The attorney general’s office, as well as commissioners for Berks, Lancaster, Lehigh, Monroe and York counties, said last year that inaccurate or deceptive voter registration forms were not accepted, and therefore did not lead to falsified voter registrations or votes cast. All of the criminal charges announced Friday relate back to a single canvassing firm called Field+Media Corps, according to the state’s criminal complaint and Monroe County District Attorney. </span></p>

Knapp, 40, was booked into the Richland County jail in the early morning hours Friday, according to jail records. Police also arrested Knapp’s former deputy, Paige Salonich. Knapp faces 11 charges total. They include eight counts of using his official position or office for financial gain — one for each month he’s accused of using state vehicles for personal travel and a public credit card to fuel up. He’s also charged with embezzlement of public funds valued at less than $10,000 (for the fuel), misconduct in office, and accessory to a felony after the fact, according to Richland County court records. Salonich, 41, faces a single wiretapping charge. The accessory and wiretapping charges involve a recording device left in a closed-door meeting of the election agency’s governing board. According to arrest warrants provided by State Law Enforcement Division, Knapp is accused of driving — or letting his wife drive — a pair of state-owned vehicles for personal use between June 2023 and January 2024 and using a state credit card to purchase fuel for those off-duty trips to the tune of about $5,480.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5228" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virginia-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Virginia:</strong> U.S. District Judge John Gibney ruled in favor of a pair of </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-sides-with-disenfranchised-voters-in-challenge-to-virginias-felony-voting-laws/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disenfranchised voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who argued Virginia’s felony voting law violates a 150-year-old federal statute. Gibney ruled from the bench to grant summary judgment. He also certified a class that includes all Virginians who are currently or will be disqualified from voting due to convictions for crimes that were not considered felonies at common law in 1870. “We’re very optimistic about the judge’s comments at the end of the hearing,” attorney Brittany Amadi, partner at Wilmer Cutler, representing the plaintiffs, said in an interview. “Our plaintiffs have been waiting for some, some of them years and years to get their voting rights back, and so we’re very excited about the opportunity for those plaintiffs to restore their rights.” The plaintiffs, Tati King and Toni Johnson, who the state disenfranchised after drug- and child-neglect-related felonies,</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/king-v-youngkin-motion-for-summary-judgment.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> claim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Virginia’s felony disenfranchisement scheme violates the Virginia Readmission Act of 1870, which restored federal representation for the Confederate commonwealth after the Civil War. The 1870 law prohibited Virginia from amending the constitution to increase voting disenfranchisement, which was a political tool Southern states used during Reconstruction to strangle the nascent voting power of the formerly enslaved. The plaintiffs argued that under the act, the state can only disenfranchise those convicted of crimes considered to be common law felonies in 1870, including murder, arson, sodomy, robbery and larceny. Professor Carissa Byrne Hessick of the University of North Carolina School of Law identified 1,096 modern Virginia statutory felonies that were not felonies at common law in 1870 in her expert report, including offenses related to drug possession and distribution. Gibney said that although he believed the constitution’s changes violated the act, he wants further briefing on how best to issue an injunction. “It looks to me the statute is pretty wrong,&#8221; the Barack Obama appointee said. “But someone needs to provide guidance to those in the field.” Gibney said he was concerned about how local registrars would determine who to reenfranchise. Gibney asked both parties to compile a list of felonies that no longer require disenfranchisement.</span></p>
