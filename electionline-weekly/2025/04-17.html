														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Ballot Verifier </strong><br />
</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new standard in transparency</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electionline.org</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the 2020 election, </span><a href="https://adacounty.id.gov/elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ada County, Idaho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like most elections offices around the country, saw an unprecedented increase in the public interest in the voting process. Included in this interest was an exponential uptick in public records requests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Ada County, many of the requests related to both Cast Vote Records (“CVR” or “CVRs”) and inspection of ballots or ballot images.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, the elections office set the audacious goal of posting all ballot images and corresponding CVRs after every election in a user-friendly, public database that is easily accessible to all citizens, free of charge–a site that eventually became known as </span><a href="https://ballotverifier.adacounty.id.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ballot Verifier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12766" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdaCo04.17.25A-300x131.png" alt="" width="300" height="131" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdaCo04.17.25A-300x131.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdaCo04.17.25A-1024x447.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdaCo04.17.25A-768x335.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdaCo04.17.25A-1536x670.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdaCo04.17.25A-2048x893.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The county partnered with </span><a href="https://civera.com/ballot-verifier/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civera</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a civic technology company that had already worked with the secretary of state’s office in Idaho.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county and Civera began discussion in September of 2022 regarding the feasibility of such a platform and the initial stages included a discovery phase of the data and reports available through the county’s voting system, </span><a href="https://www.hartintercivic.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hart Intercivic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The county had already begun exploring the capture of ballot images and CVRs in November of 2021 and had full data sets beginning in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to finding a company to partner with, the county had to ensure that their idea fell within all existing Idaho laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had to ensure Idaho Constitution’s requirement for a secret ballot was maintained,” said Nicole Newby, public information officer. “We took this legal requirement very seriously during development and testing and have ballot masking in place if there is any question as to how to maintain confidentiality.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After much exploration, the Ada team and Civera team determined that it was technically feasible to pair all ballot images and CVRs for every election. Accordingly, Ada County and Civera went under contract in the winter of 2023 to fully develop the Ballot Verifier, which would leverage Civera’s ElectionStats platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following months of work, they began to beta test the product internally, spending weeks identifying and overcoming issues relating to accurate pairing of ballots and CVRs, design and ease of use, and accuracy and confidentiality in all data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12767" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdaCo04.17.25B-300x212.png" alt="" width="300" height="212" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdaCo04.17.25B-300x212.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdaCo04.17.25B-1024x724.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdaCo04.17.25B-768x543.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AdaCo04.17.25B.png 1066w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />After the initial testing, they expanded the scope and brought in partners with the </span><a href="https://sos.idaho.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho Secretary of State’s Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as local Idaho election integrity advocates who are inherently skeptical of election systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we were in the testing phase of this project, we brought in some of our toughest critics and gave them the opportunity to use the tool before it was released and give us their feedback,” Newby explained. “After digging around in the tool for an hour, they told us how great it was to have this unfiltered view into elections. They said it is very beneficial to be able to see exactly what the ballot looks like after it has been marked and submitted alongside its corresponding Cast Vote Record and it provides a new window of transparency into the election process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballot Verifier <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/04/25/ada-county-elections-office-unveils-online-ballot-verifier-tool/">publicly launched</a> one month before the May 2024 primary and immediately drew the attention of not only the public, but also </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ballot-verifier-idaho-new-tech-election-deniers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The public had a very positive reaction to the Ballot Verifier,” Newby said. “There were questions from the public, relating to voter privacy, marking of ballots, etc., Overall, the public seemed to appreciate the transparency and have enjoyed having the tool available on our website.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Newby, the county IT department tracks the traffic that the site gets and the site typically sees spikes in people visiting the webpage after an election and after the ballot images and CVR’s are posted. Civera, the software company also tracks their own analytics on the site and looks more in depth as to what users are clicking on and looking for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It cost the county about $40,000 to create the initial system in partnership with Civera and Newby said the system has been an extremely beneficial tool for the office and county and provides great insight into election processes and voter behavior.</span></p>

Not only the president’s elections executive order and </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/15/cybersecurity-chris-krebs-trump-probe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presidential memoranda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but also Congress’ passage of the SAVE Act. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat, said the </span><a href="https://statescoop.com/save-act-chaos-state-local-election-offices/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SAVE Act would “cause a lot of chaos in our election system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from top to bottom.” And criminal penalties, he said, would create a “cloud of intimidation” for election offices, many of which are underpaid and understaffed. Simon said the chaos would particularly impact elections’ technical processes, such as same-day voter registration and online voter registration, the latter of which is allowed in 42 states. Utah&#8217;s top elections official doesn&#8217;t like the</span><a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51286392/house-to-consider-sen-mike-lees-bill-requiring-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SAVE Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, either. Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson told KSL in a statement this week the bill is &#8220;problematic and impractical on almost all points except its talking points.&#8221; Numerous media outlets also looked into the impacts the SAVE Act may have, especially on </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/13/g-s1-59684/save-act-married-women-vote-rights-explained"><span style="font-weight: 400;">married women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

According to The Post, if put into effect, his recent executive order attempting to transform elections could make it impossible for some states to use voting machines, election experts said. No voting systems are commercially available that meet the standards the president put forward in his executive order. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan, </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/federal-judge-calls-trumps-order-targeting-prominent-law-firm-shocking-rcna200961"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blocked a new executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> punishing a prominent law firm that successfully sued Fox News for promoting false claims of election fraud. Speaking from the bench in her Washington, D.C., courtroom this week, AliKhan said Trump’s order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey was part of a “personal vendetta.” “The framers of our Constitution would see this as a shocking abuse of power,” AliKhan said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to presidential rulemaking and legislation, NPR had a story this week about Antonio Gracias, one of Elon Musk&#8217;s Department of Government Efficiency lieutenants working in the Social Security Administration who has been </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/11/nx-s1-5352470/doge-musk-social-security-voting"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushing claims about noncitizens voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, apparently using access to data that court records suggest DOGE isn&#8217;t supposed to have. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also this week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/16/state-department-shutters-gec-foreign-disinformation-00292982"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closure of the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the State Department, formerly known as the Global Engagement Center. In a statement, Rubio claimed the office “spent millions of dollars to actively silence and censor the voices of Americans they were supposed to be serving.” According to Rubio, the relatively modest federal office expended “more than $50 million per year.” Funding for the center was stripped out of the final government funding deal signed into law by President Joe Biden in December, when its congressional authorization was set to expire. Previously, the center exposed a major Russian disinformation campaign in Africa, and last year put together an international agreement — now removed from the State Department’s website —to counter foreign disinformation that had the backing of around two dozen other nations.</span></p>

The report found that a total of </span><a href="https://www.nj.com/burlington/2025/04/nj-countys-election-chaos-caused-by-new-voting-machines-poor-training.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13% fewer people voted in the 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> election in Burlington County than in 2016 due to long lines caused in part by a lack of communication and coordination with the county’s election offices, a late rollout of new voting machines, and troublesome polling locations. The report outlines findings of “a culture of territorialism,” “partisan tension,” and “personality conflicts” among countywide election offices. The report also cited poll workers who refused to accept delivery of a new voting machine that would have alleviated delays; poorly trained poll workers who did not understand the voting process; and election officials who would “not work together at all,” among other problems. he findings are part of a preliminary accounting of events that presages a final report, the date of which has not been determined.

The report includes recommendations meant to “substantially mitigate, if not eliminate, many of the problems that occurred on Election Day in November 2024” across many of the county’s 40 municipalities. Burlington County Commissioner Director Felicia Hopson acknowledged in a statement that “there were failures all around and the report makes that clear.” She added that the law firm “has done exactly what we asked,” with the interim report outlining “preliminary factual findings and assessments about what caused the unacceptable long lines and delays on Election Day, and it makes recommendations about what actions our county should take to prevent the problems from occurring again.”</span></p>

As an added precaution, I’m directing the boards of elections who use this specific style of pollbook to use paper pollbooks for the May election. This action will have little to no impact on voters, as we anticipate turnout to be relatively low, and I’ve always required boards of elections to have paper pollbook backups ready to go as a contingency.” The switch to paper pollbooks, which is a return to how many Ohioans checked in at the polls in the past, will be easier to manage on May 6 than it might have been during some other elections, said Brian Mead, director of the Licking County Board of Elections “We don’t expect delays because we don’t expect a big turnout,” he said.

She was 76. Kale-Pesta spent 33 years working for the county board of elections as a director, deputy director and clerk. After her retirement in November 2021, Kale-Pesta was appointed to serve as a board of elections member, holding that position until her death. Kale-Pesta was also the county Democratic Party’s vice chairwoman, the state Democratic Party central committeewoman representing the 33rd District and secretary of the Ohio Association of Election Officials at the time of her death. She served as the county Democratic Party’s chairwoman from May 2019 to June 2022, the only woman to lead the local party. Mahoning County Republican Party Chairman Tom McCabe, who worked 27 years with Kale-Pesta at the elections board, said, “She was a great partner. We got along great. She loved elections. She was a trailblazer.” Kale-Pesta started working for the board of elections as a clerk in December 1988. She was promoted to deputy director in 2005 and served as the board’s director from 2012 until her retirement in November 2021. Kale-Pesta was quickly appointed as a board member after her retirement and continued to serve in that capacity. Elections board Chairman David Betras said of Kale-Pesta: “It’s like losing a family member. That’s how close we were. She was iconic when it comes to Mahoning County politics and voting. I’m devastated. It’s a void that I don’t think can be filled by anyone.”</span></p>

Nearly all Democrats lined up against the bill and warned that it risks disenfranchising millions of Americans who do not have ready access to the proper documents. The </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/congress-save-act-citizenship-republicans-women-0c0ba9fd8e6a01cf144736490c71df21"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SAVE Act would require</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all applicants using the federal voter registration form to provide documentary proof of citizenship in person at their local election office. Among the acceptable documents are a valid U.S. passport and a government-issued photo ID card presented alongside a certified birth certificate. The SAVE Act compels states to reject any voter registration application in which the applicant has not presented “documentary proof of United States citizenship.” Among the acceptable documents for demonstrating proof of citizenship are: A REAL ID-compliant driver’s license that “indicates the applicant is a citizen.”; A valid U.S. passport; A military ID card with a military record of service that lists the applicant’s birthplace as in the U.S.; A valid government-issued photo ID that shows the applicant’s birthplace was in the U.S.; or A valid government-issued photo ID presented with a document such as a certified birth certificate that shows the birthplace was in the U.S. The SAVE Act directs states, in consultation with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, to ensure that “reasonable accommodations” are made to allow individuals with disabilities who submit the form to provide proof of citizenship to their election official. The legislation also considers that some states permit same-day voter registration and says, in those cases, voters must present proof of citizenship at their polling location “not later than the date of the election.” That would mean that people who do not have such proof with them would have to return with their documents before polls close to be registered and have their ballot counted. The legislation says anyone registering through a state motor vehicle agency also is required to provide proof of citizenship. It directs the Election Assistance Commission to issue guidance to state election officials about implementing the law’s requirements. “This legislation would immediately disenfranchise the 69 million women who have changed their names after marriage or divorce,” said Rep. Deborah Ross, a Democrat from North Carolina. Rep. Laurel Lee, a Republican from Florida, said the bill “contemplates this exact situation” of married women whose names have changed, saying it “explicitly directs states to establish a process for them to register to vote.” Morelle countered by saying, “Why not write it in the bill? Why are we making the potential for 50 different standards to be set? &#8230; How much paperwork do Republicans expect Americans to drown in?”</span></p>

The Juneau Assembly made by-mail voting the default in 2023. Last year, a group of residents tried unsuccessfully to repeal that ordinance. The new petition filed this year seeks to amend the language in that same ordinance to make elections poll-based again instead of by-mail. The group cites increased cost to conduct elections and slower results as the reason behind the initiative, according to documents submitted to the city clerk’s office. By-mail voting has been used by the city since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In-person voting is still available at city vote centers. The city’s law department and the city clerk still need to review the three petitions. If they are approved, the Affordable Juneau Coalition has 30 days to gather just over 2,700 signatures for each petition to secure a spot on the ballot this October.</span></p>

Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, would require the state’s Board of Pardons and Paroles to develop new procedures to make the restoration process easier. The bill passed the Senate 27-0. Under existing Alabama law, individuals can lose their right to vote following a conviction in state or federal court. They may have that right restored by the Board of Pardons and Paroles if they meet certain requirements, such as paying fines, fees and court costs and having completed their sentence. The bill seeks to make the restoration process more transparent and accessible. It requires the Board of Pardons and Paroles and the Secretary of State to develop and make available on their websites a specific form and instructions for applying for a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote. This applies to individuals who met the eligibility criteria outlined in the state code before Oct. 1, 2025. Applicants would submit this form to the board for review. The board would be required to provide the secretary of state with the individual’s address and the date their voting rights were restored. Once the information is received, the secretary of state would then notify both the individual and the board of registrars in the county where the individual resides about the restoration date. The county board of registrars would be required to add the individual’s name back to the poll list and inform the person of their eligibility date, unless the individual had never been registered to vote prior to their conviction.</span></p>

This type of identification is currently not included on the Alabama Secretary of State&#8217;s list of forms of valid photo identification that can be used to vote. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency can issue this form of identification to people who are in the United States legally but are not citizens. The identification is distinguished by an &#8220;FN&#8221; and labeled as not a form of federal ID. &#8220;My understanding is that there&#8217;s been some confusion at the polling places, my understanding and what I&#8217;ve been told, they&#8217;ve been used. If they have or haven&#8217;t been used, this bill simply says they cannot be used,&#8221; said Rep. Allen Treadaway, R-Morris. </span></p>

The bill is designed to make sure that people living in larger cities in Arkansas have </span><a href="https://katv.com/news/arkansas-house-bill-1878-mandates-early-voting-sites-in-cities-over-15000-population-voters-locations-government-solution-politics-election-boards-primary-general-county-officials"><span style="font-weight: 400;">better access to early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The bill would require county election officials to offer early voting in certain cities, and allow them to offer even more early voting locations if they choose. HB 1878 would require county election boards to provide early voting locations for primary and general elections in any city that has more than 15,000 people and where the county clerk is not already providing early voting. “This bill is a good government solution that would ensure every Arkansas population center will have at least one early voting location,” says McGruder. “It would protect our elections from bad actors, and it would protect Arkansas voters.“</span></p>

It allows exceptions for provisional ballots and mail-in ballots that have issues such as a missing or mismatched voter signature. Voters would still have time to “cure” those ballots, or rectify any mistake to ensure their vote is counted. Berman’s bill would also allow counties to request an extension from the Secretary of State. The San Mateo County Democrat acknowledged California’s drawn-out vote counting “can be confusing to voters (and) frustrating for candidates.” He said the bill may still undergo tweaks as he works with county election officials to refine the language. The bill would not change official election certification timelines. Counties must certify their election within 30 days of the election. The Secretary of State certifies all results 38 days after the election. Elections officials have said that above speed, they prize accuracy and rules that give voters ample time to correct issues with mail-in ballots. “It’s about getting it right, not rushing it,” said Assemblymember Gail Pellerin, D-Santa Cruz, a former county elections chief. Pellerin endorsed Berman’s bill earlier this week, saying it strikes a balance that will not “compromise the accuracy, security and integrity of the election.” The bill passed its first hurdle in the Assembly Elections Committee on Wednesday and will next be heard in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.</span></p>

Ranked choice voting proponents wanted the idea to gain momentum at a meeting of the county Finance and Government Operations Committee meeting. But Supervisors Betty Duong and Susan Ellenberg, who sit on the committee, opted to delay bringing the proposal to the full Board of Supervisors until sometime after Sept. 30. “It’s not about the issue philosophically,” Duong said at the meeting. “It’s about the existential crisis of what this county will look like and how this county will operate.” Implementing ranked choice voting — a system where voters rank a candidate from first choice, second, third and so on — would cost about $4 million in the first year if applied only to countywide elected offices such as supervisor, sheriff, district attorney and assessor, according to estimates by county election officials. That includes nearly $3 million in one-time costs to educate residents about ranked choice voting. Sept. 30 marks the end of the current federal fiscal year, by which point county officials should know more about the extent of the federal funding losses they’re looking at. County officials said it doesn’t make sense to implement the new system, if approved, until 2028. Numerous decisions would still need to be made if supervisors approve the idea in general. They’ll have to decide how many county offices it will apply to, and whether to implement the system at the primary or maintain a runoff election. County lawyers will also have to draft policy that would come back for full board approval, unless county supervisors choose to put the question before voters again — nearly 30 years after receiving early voter support for the system in 1998.</span></p>

After the Indiana House of Representatives passed an amended form of Senate Bill 10 on April 2, the bill was shipped back to the State Senate, where it passed 39-9 along party lines in the Republican-supermajority chamber. Previously, acceptable forms of photo ID included student IDs from public universities, Indiana driver’s licenses, military ID cards, Indiana photo ID cards and U.S. passports. SB 10 removes student IDs from that list. The ban may create an extra obstacle for out-of-state students who wish to vote using their university residence. Students will have to change to an Indiana driver’s license or pay $165 to obtain a passport if they don’t already have one.</span></p>

In races for local offices and the Iowa Legislature, there would need to be difference of 1% or 50 votes between the candidates — whichever is less — for a candidate to request a recount. For statewide and federal races, the bill would require a 0.15% difference. Election recount boards would change from their current make-up of a person designated by each candidate, alongside one other individual agreed upon by both candidates. The new system would have county auditors lead the board with their staff and hired election workers, with a requirement that boards must have equal numbers of workers from each political party. Candidates could also be able to choose up to five people to observe the recount in each county. The bill would also implement an earlier deadline for requesting a recount, requiring requests be submitted by the end of the day of the second Wednesday after an election. The current deadline is the second Friday after an election. Recounts would be requested through the Secretary of State’s office for legislative, statewide and federal races, a change from the current system where campaigns make requests to each county auditor. Another portion of the bill requires recounts to be conducted using vote tabulators, whereas current law allows hand-counting in some areas. Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Oskaloosa, said these changes put Iowa’s recount process in line with other states, and addresses existing problems with potential conflicts of interest that exist in allowing campaigns to oversee the recount process.</span></p>

The bill passed with support from 42 Democrats and 43 Republicans, the Missourian reports, although most House Republicans voted against it. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Rudy Veit, R-Wardsville, would bring back state-run presidential primaries. In 2022, Missouri lawmakers eliminated the primaries as part of a sweeping elections bill backed by then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft. At the time, supporters said it would save the state money. The estimated cost to the state for conducting the primaries is $8 million, according to Missourian reporting.</span></p>

The legislation requires the Secretary of State to allow any registered voter to use an approved electronic transmission system to apply for and cast a ballot if they cannot access their mail ballot or are unable to go to the polls due to illness or disability. This system was previously limited to military, overseas voters, and certain disabled or tribal voters. </span><a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/83rd2025/Bill/11881/Overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 74</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also removes restrictions on candidacy for those who have changed voter registration information in another state and sets forth a new form for independent candidates&#8217; declarations of candidacy. Additionally, it allows candidate filing fees to be paid by credit card and mandates that election notices include candidate names and party affiliations. County and city clerks are authorized to notify the public about these changes, and the bill clarifies that pupils can be appointed as election board trainees regardless of political affiliation. It also revises the process for declaring candidates elected in primary elections and updates standards for counting votes. The legislation introduces &#8220;election accuracy audits&#8221; and allows for inspection of election materials for audit purposes. It also requires voter registration agencies to inform voters registering after the mail deadline that they must register online or in person to vote in upcoming elections. Furthermore, the bill mandates the Secretary of State to adopt a cyber-incident response plan and allows certain elderly dependents to request confidentiality of personal information. It aligns the withdrawal of candidacy deadlines for city office candidates with those for other candidates and clarifies campaign contribution limits for special elections. The bill repeals certain provisions related to vote counting and voter registration transmission, aiming to streamline and modernize Nevada&#8217;s election processes.</span></p>

The legislation received wide support in both the House and Senate. “Now more than ever, we need a consistent, efficient and easy-to-understand voter experience across our entire state to maintain trust in our election system,” Armstrong said in a statement Wednesday. </span><a href="https://ndlegis.gov/assembly/69-2025/regular/bill-index/bi1297.html?bill_year=2025&amp;bill_number=1297"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“House Bill 1297</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ensures a uniform system of secure elections at all levels of government in North Dakota. This is one more in a series of proactive, common-sense steps our Secretary of State and Legislature have taken to support election integrity,” he said. Approval voting allows each voter to vote for all candidates of whom they approve instead of choosing one. This method is used for city elections in Fargo — the first city in the nation to use approval voting. Fargo voted to use approval voting through an initiated ballot measure in 2018, with 64% of voters casting ballots in favor of the new system. It was used during the 2020, 2022 and 2024 mayoral and City Commission elections. Cities, counties and any political subdivision statewide are now barred from using either system to elect or nominate a candidate to any local, state or federal office.</span></p>

The proof-of-citizenship requirements trigger when voters register or update their existing registration. So, registered voters won’t notice any changes until they update information to reflect changes like a new name or address. If everything goes smoothly, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles will already have citizenship documentation on file. But if not, county boards of elections will start sending notices, and pretty soon prosecutors could get involved. If a voter doesn’t respond to a pair of notices sent over the course of four weeks, the secretary of state must cancel their registration and refer the case to the attorney general. The same goes for voters who proactively cancel their registration after receiving the notice. Ditto if they vote provisionally and then fail to provide citizenship documents within four days of the election. Similarly, if a county board receives a registration form from someone who’s ineligible — even in error — the board must refer the case to the county prosecutor. In the name of security, the measure also eliminates ballot drop boxes and codifies an attestation form requirement for anyone dropping off another person’s ballot.</span></p>

Frank Burns is proposing new legislation that would require </span><a href="https://wjactv.com/news/local/proposed-legislation-would-required-pre-election-day-testing-all-pa-voting-machines-pennsylvania-elections-bill-voters"><span style="font-weight: 400;">standardized testing of voting machines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in all of Pennsylvania. The proposal comes after ballots in Cambria County were not able to be electronically tabulated in the last general election. The proposed bill would require the testing of voting machine equipment before Election Day by using the actual ballots printed for that upcoming election. The Department of State would also be required to post the certifications of accuracy on its website after the testing, under the proposed bill. In a statement to WTAJ, the Solicitor for the Commissioner’s Office noted that the Pennsylvania Department of State already sets a standardization for logic and accuracy testing each year. The county argued that it already follows the standards set in place and did so leading up to and for the 2024 election.</span></p>

The resolution against the proposed legislation was approved this week.. Potter County Judge Nancy Tanner emphasized the importance of convenience for voters. &#8220;The convenience of going to work, stopping on the way to work, stopping on the way home. We have so many of them out there, I do the same thing every time there&#8217;s an election. On the way to work, I&#8217;ll stop and vote there,&#8221; she said. If the legislation is enacted, it could lead to increased costs for taxpayers. Potter County Elections Administrator Christy Benge explained that additional resources would be necessary. &#8220;So, if we went to 24 locations, we would have to increase our staffing. For the November presidential election, we probably had 185 people that we used between early voting and election day,&#8221; Benge said. While the county has not provided an estimate of the potential costs, officials noted that voters appreciate the current system.</span></p>

The last time voters in Randall County were required to do so was 13 years ago. Shannon Lackey, Randall County Elections Administrator, expressed concerns about the financial impact on taxpayers. &#8220;We would have to double our polling place locations on election day,&#8221; Lackey said. &#8220;That means we would need more voting equipment, more poll workers, more outreach for the voters, and voters would be turned away on election day if they were at the wrong location.&#8221; The proposed change would also necessitate redrawing voting precincts after each census, adding to potential confusion. Currently, 96 counties in Texas, representing more than 80 percent of registered voters, hold county-wide elections. The last election, a presidential race, saw record-breaking voter turnout in Randall and Potter counties.</span></p>

The GOP-backed measure,</span><a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Text_HTML/2025_SESSIONS/RS/bills/hb3016%20sub1%20eng.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Bill 3016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is meant to address voter fraud and bolster secure elections. In a state with abysmal voter turnout, opponents of the bill worry it would make it harder for West Virginia residents, particularly older residents, to vote on Election Day. The bill would require a photo ID — typically a driver’s license, passport or a resident identification card — to vote in-person. It would eliminate several current options accepted at polling places that can validate identity, including a Medicaid card and utility bill. It passed the Senate with a vote of 32-2. The measure permits voters 65 and older to use an expired ID, including an expired driver’s license, as long as it was valid on their 65th birthday. Additionally, poll workers may allow a voter, whom the poll worker has known for at least six months, to vote without presenting a valid ID. West Virginia residents can request a voter registration card with a photo free of charge from a county clerk’s office. The House of Delegates approved the legislation on March 28.</span></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5218" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AlabamaFlag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Alabama:</strong> The Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Madison County Commission this week. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of two Black voters in Madison County and the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, </span><a href="https://www.waff.com/2025/04/15/legal-defense-fund-sues-madison-county-commission-over-alleged-voting-rights-violations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleges voting rights violations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to a press release. The lawsuit alleges that the current voting system denies Black people an equal opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. “This is an important case that challenges a discriminatory method of conducting county elections, which makes Black residents more vulnerable to discriminatory education, employment, and health outcomes,” said Brittany Carter, Assistant Counsel at the Legal Defense Fund. “LDF will continue to defend the voting rights of Black people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Arizona:</strong> The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is </span><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/arizona/2025/04/10/trump-administration-withdraws-from-arizona-voter-citizenship-challenge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asking to withdraw from a longstanding court case </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenging Arizona’s voter citizenship laws. DOJ filed a motion April 8 seeking to voluntarily dismiss its claims against Arizona in regards to two Republican-backed voter citizenship laws that the Biden administration had argued violated federal law. The request, in the Mi Familia Vota v. Fontes case, does not affect the pending outcome of the case, which will still continue under several plaintiffs even if the request is granted. But it is the latest example of how the Trump administration’s priorities are reshaping the Justice Department’s approach to voting rights cases to no longer challenge state laws the Biden administration saw as illegally restricting voting. It is also aligned with his recent executive order on elections, which would require documented proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections. Danielle Lang, senior director of voting rights for Campaign Legal Center, which is representing many of the groups that sued, including Living United for Change in Arizona and the League of United Latin American Citizens, said that while DOJ’s withdrawal has no practical impact, it demonstrates the new administration’s “complete abandonment of even the most basic voting rights protections.”</span></p>

In March, the DOJ voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit, but not before two Black Houston County residents, Courtney Driver and Mike Jones, joined the case as Plaintiff-Intervenors. Court documents listed the county, its current Board of Commissioners, Board of Elections and its chair, Pamela Morgan, as defendants. In a new legal battle, Houston County&#8217;s attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the Plaintiff-Intervenors&#8217; case, arguing they need a &#8220;private right of action&#8221; without the backing of the DOJ. &#8220;Without a private right of action, this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff-Intervenors’ claim and their Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety,&#8221; the filing states. They also argued that Houston County and the Board of Commissioners should be removed from the case because they do not control how elections are administered. According to court records, U.S. Middle District Court of Georgia Judge Marc T. Treadwell granted the order and terminated Houston County&#8217;s attorney&#8217;s motion to dismiss the case entirely on April 7. However, Judge Treadwell did not specify why he disagreed with the former defendant&#8217;s arguments for a private right of action. The case now leaves Driver and Jones as sole plaintiffs and the Houston County Board of Elections and its chair, Pamela Morgan, as defendants in the voting rights violation lawsuit.</span></p>

The panel ordered the state to redraw 10 Senate voting districts and five House districts in response to a 2022 NAACP lawsuit that alleged voting power for the black voting age population (BVAP) was diluted in Mississippi due to gerrymandered district lines. The panel of judges accepted the redrawn House Districts 16, 22, 36, 39, and 41 in Chickasaw County, but upheld the plaintiffs’ appeal that the new map in DeSoto County, redrawing Senate Districts 1, 2, 10, 11, and 19, was not satisfactory.  In previous hearings, the panel cited a lack of precedent for what exactly delineates equal opportunity for Black voters. Republican lawmakers decried the line of decisions, specifically in DeSoto County, arguing that districts should not be drawn to guarantee the election of Black Democrats, but rather that maps should provide equal opportunity.   But for the new DeSoto County voting map, the panel sided with the Mississippi NAACP’s argument that even though the changed districts became majority Black when they previously weren’t, “effective opportunity” that took socioeconomic, voting history, and prior election result factors into account was not established.  The State Board of Election Commissioners was given seven days to propose a new map for the districts in DeSoto County that are more favorable for Black voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5224" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/North-Carolina-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />North Carolina</strong>: In a 4-2 decision, the</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/north-carolina-supreme-court-orders-60000-ballots-to-be-upheld-in-disputed-court-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> North Carolina Supreme Court issued an order </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">upholding the validity of over 60,00 ballots cast in its associate justice race, requiring thousands of others to be cured and discarding almost 300 ballots. North Carolina Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin has challenged over 65,000 ballots after trailing behind his opponent, Associate Justice Allison Riggs, in the election over a seat on the state’s highest court. He claims that over 60,000 ballots cast by voters who have data missing in the state’s voter roll database should be removed or cured and that the state should also require ballots cast by overseas and military voters to be cured, as it did not require them to provide photo ID to vote. Furthermore, Griffin has pushed that several hundred ballots cast by U.S. citizens residing abroad who have never resided in the United States — dubbed “never residents” — should be invalidated in his race. Many of these voters could potentially be ineligible to vote, Griffin has said, although he has not been able to prove any ballots were falsely cast.  The most recent</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/griffin-riggs-supreme-court-60k-ballots-order.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the state’s highest court found that voters with missing data in the database — over 60,000 — do not need to cure their ballots. They had previously been given 15 business days to cure their ballots for their vote to be counted in Griffin’s race. The justices noted that it would be a different case if North Carolina’s voter ID law were not in effect, as all voters were required to present photo ID at the polls or fill out a photo exemption form. These voters are impacted by the state election board’s “inattention and failure to dutifully confirm its conduct to the law’s requirements,” Associate Justice Trey Allen</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/griffin-riggs-supreme-court-60k-ballots-order.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the order, calling the incomplete registrations the board’s responsibility, not that of voters. “Under this court’s longstanding precedent, mistakes made by negligent election officials in registering citizens who are otherwise eligible to vote &#8216;will not deprive the [citizens] of [their] right to vote or render [their] vote[s] void after [they have] been cast,’” Allen wrote. “Because the responsibility for the technical defects in the voters’ registrations rests with the board and not the voters, the wholesale voiding of ballots cast by individuals who subsequently proved their identity to the board by complying with the voter identification law would undermine the principle that ‘this is a government of the people, in which the will of the people the majority legally expressed, must govern,’” the justice said. The court ordered that military and overseas voters will be required to cure their ballots but given a longer deadline: 30 business days after the notices are mailed, instead of the Court of Appeals’ 15 business days. Thousands of voters abroad may be impacted. So-called never residents, of which there are 267, will not have their ballots counted, as the court denied review of the Court of Appeals’ decision to discard them. The justices also dissolved a stay they issued earlier this week, halting the curing process, and sent the case back down to the Court of Appeals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Military spouses and overseas voters filed a </span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/military-spouses-overseas-voters-sue-over-north-carolina-ballot-curing-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">class action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> April 14, hoping to block post-election voter verification processes implemented by the North Carolina Supreme Court that would require their ballots to be cured or removed.  “The U.S. Constitution prohibits North Carolina from retroactively applying novel election rules articulated months after the 2024 election to arbitrarily disenfranchise eligible, qualified voters like plaintiffs,” the League of Women Voters of North Carolina and a group of U.S. citizens voting abroad say in their</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/conley-hirsch-griffin-ballot-complaint.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against members of the state board of elections. The plaintiffs argue that they were not required to provide photo ID to vote, and were prohibited from doing so when they cast their ballots. They could not have possibly complied with a requirement that did not exist at the time of the election, they said. According to the plaintiffs, Griffin did not contact any of them informing them that their ballot was being challenged and that they may be required to act for their vote to be counted in the Supreme Court associate justice race.  “Voters relied on election officials to maintain and enforce lawful election rules, and they relied on election officials’ assurances that they had fulfilled all applicable requirements to register and to vote in the Seat Six election. Articulating new rules months after the votes were counted, and then retroactively applying those rules to overturn the democratic choice of the voters, deprives plaintiffs of their fundamental rights to vote and to due process, which ‘protects the right of qualified citizens to vote and to have their votes counted as cast,’” the plaintiffs say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superior Court Judges Edwin Wilson, Andrew Womble and Lori Hamilton heard arguments this week from attorneys for Republican legislative leaders who insist their latest method to attempt to </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-elections-board-hearing-governor-auditor-8dac6c2e22bf1304f7b11aa17ef1e6a8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrest control of the State Board of Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a Democratic governor is lawful — this time giving the job of appointing members to the GOP state auditor. But lawyers for Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who sued to stop the changes approved late last year by the General Assembly and begin in earnest next month, contend the alteration suffers constitutional flaws similar to those that caused courts to strike down previous GOP attempts. “The General Assembly is on a mission to both enact and execute the state’s elections,” Stein attorney Jim Phillips said while urging Wilson, Womble and Hamilton to strike down the latest law. The judges didn’t immediately rule after a 2 1/2-hour hearing but have signaled they would act before the chief change starts May 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5225" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Oklahoma-Flag-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Oklahoma:</strong> A legal fight is underway over the </span><a href="https://www.news9.com/story/67fd134130d5045107639581/oklahoma-primary-elections-lawsuit-sq836"><span style="font-weight: 400;">future of primary elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Oklahoma. The state’s Republican Party is asking the Oklahoma Supreme Court to block State Question 836, a proposed ballot initiative that would open up primary elections to all voters, regardless of party affiliation. Supporters of the measure say it could expand voter access and increase turnout. But Republican leaders argue it infringes on the constitutional rights of political parties. The proposed initiative would allow registered voters in Oklahoma to vote in any primary election, even if they’re not affiliated with the party hosting that primary. Currently, political parties in Oklahoma can choose whether to open their primaries to independents. Only registered Republicans can vote in Republican primaries, while registered Democrats and registered Independents can vote in Democrat primaries. SQ 836 would change that, allowing all registered voters to participate regardless of party rules. The Oklahoma Republican Party filed a lawsuit with the state’s highest court, claiming SQ 836 violates their First Amendment rights. They argue that political parties are private associations with the constitutional right to determine who participates in their candidate selection process. Forcing them to accept votes from outside the party, they say, is unconstitutional.</span></p>
