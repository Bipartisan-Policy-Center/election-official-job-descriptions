							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>The Elections Group publishes storytelling guide for election officials</strong><br />
<em>Seeks input on upcoming communications work</em></p>
<p>By Chris Piper, chief operating officer<br />
The Elections Group</p>
<p>In 2021, Virginia was one of two states to hold Gubernatorial elections, and as the state’s chief election official, I knew all eyes were going to be focused on us. Following 2020 and the many lessons learned from it, we decided to attack the communications issue head on to reassure the public of the security and trustworthiness of our elections.</p>
<p>Virginia election administrators authored<a href="https://richmond.com/opinion/columnists/chris-piper-column-virginias-defenders-of-democracy-ensure-free-fair-and-secure-elections/article_a78e928d-031a-575c-bcd2-c4d7445d6ebd.html"> op-eds</a> in local publications touting the integrity of the election system. We produced radio ads and<a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/defend-democracy/"> commercials</a>. Across the country, many election offices would like to engage in similar efforts but do not have the resources. Election officials need communications support.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8389" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ElectionsGroupComms-231x300.png" alt="" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ElectionsGroupComms-231x300.png 231w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ElectionsGroupComms.png 380w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" />I am excited to announce that The Elections Group is releasing the first in a series of elections communications related materials for an ongoing communication support project.<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/telling-our-story-guide"> Telling Our Story: An Elections Communication Guide</a>, written by former National Public Radio (NPR) correspondent Pam Fessler, is now available.</p>
<p>With more than 20 years of experience reporting on voting and elections, Pam brings an unmatched level of expertise in telling the stories that listeners can relate to, a strategy from which elections officials can benefit.</p>
<p>The guide provides simple and proven methods for <strong>countering misinformation</strong>; <strong>educating voters</strong>; <strong>working with the media</strong>; and – perhaps most important of all – <strong>increasing Americans’ overall trust, respect and enthusiasm</strong> for our election system and the tens of thousands of people who make it work. Examples include work being done by election administrators  that have been effective without big investments of time or money, both of which are in short supply.</p>
<p>Some strategies  include writing op-eds or articles, meeting directly with concerned citizens, and proactively reaching out to media in your area covering voting and elections. These are simple – yet effective – strategies to engage voters to reinvigorate their trust in elections.</p>
<p>Election administrators strive to ensure processes and documentation are transparent and accessible to candidates, political parties and other observers. They also hoped not to be the story, believing that they did their job well if no one talked about the process or the people administering it.</p>
<p>But following 2020, election administrators can no longer be silent &#8211; they must tell their story.</p>
<p><em>Telling Our Story</em> is the first offering in a series of communications products The Elections Group is producing. Be on the lookout this summer for items such as customizable printed posters, infographics and public-facing handouts; an election video series; scripts and presentation material for community and stakeholder engagement; and guidance on producing professional-looking videos of election processes.</p>
<p>Our team would love to hear from you on what your office needs to help tell your story. We’ve set up a form to get your feedback:<a href="https://airtable.com/shr9hTBFgARXldrW0"> https://airtable.com/shr9hTBFgARXldrW0</a>.</p>
<p><em>Chris Piper is the chief operating officer of The Elections Group. He previously served as the commissioner of the Virginia Department of Elections.</em></p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Voters in five states cast ballots in 2022 primaries</strong><br />
<em>Isolated issues in each state, but no major statewide problems</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>Five states  — Idaho, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania — held their primaries this week. Overall, there were not that many issues although counties in Oregon and Pennsylvania both suffered ballot printing issues.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief look at how Tuesday went in each state.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7304" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IDWelcome-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IDWelcome-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IDWelcome-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IDWelcome.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Idaho</strong>: It was a pretty normal Election Day in the Gem State. There were some issues though. IN<a href="https://bonnercountydailybee.com/news/2022/may/18/signs-supporters-near-polling-sites-prompt-complai/"> Bonner County</a>, campaigning and signs near a number of polling places prompted complaints to the county clerk’s office. At some precincts in<a href="https://www.idahopress.com/eyeonboise/long-lines-reported-at-some-canyon-county-polling-places-not-in-ada-which-added-50/article_1b0c2190-ccc0-5240-81c8-f8e1ac44b7cd.html"> Canyon County</a>, wait times on Election Day stretched on for more than 45 minutes. At least one losing candidate complained about<a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/politics/elections/debunking-2022-idaho-primary-election-misinformation/277-fb1a0d76-65d9-44b9-9b6a-d4d5423430b4"> election shenanigans</a>. The complaint involved the impact Democrats switching to the Republican party in order to vote in the primary may have had, not any malfeasance on behalf of elections officials. A polling places in schools in<a href="https://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/polling-location-school-placed-on-temporary-lockdown/article_940dd399-3f7b-52a1-b07a-66e0f87948b7.html"> Blaine County</a> were temporarily put on lockdown when there were reports of shots fired at another school.<a href="https://www.kivitv.com/ksaw/local-officials-work-to-make-voting-secure"> Twin Falls County</a> saw a smooth election day.<a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2022/05/17/csi-students-get-involved-election-day/"> Political science students</a> at the College of Southern Idaho served as poll workers on Tuesday and learned a thing or two about who comes out to vote. One student says this is his second time working the polls. He says it is eye-opening as to what types of people show up to the polls. “It’s the older people,” said Taylor Carnell, one of the poll workers. “And I think what’s really nice is when we get those younger people in here to vote. We’re college students, we come in and we work the elections, I think that’s what’s really important is every demographic participating in these processes.” And Ada County Clerk<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-donald-trump-presidential-brad-little-f565f6e9c0d978b0d4e3fb2bbf0110d8"> Phil McGrane</a> won the Republican nomination for secretary of state. He will face Democrat Shawn Keenan, who ran unopposed,  in November.</p>

But nothing systemic,&#8221; explained Secretary of State Michael Adams. In<a href="https://www.paducahsun.com/news/consolidation-of-precincts-contributed-to-voter-confusion/article_0ad41d33-7ab6-54a9-9780-9d5d37e1d37c.html"> McCracken County</a>, some voters were confused by redistricting, despite getting postcards with the new information in advance of the election. In<a href="https://www.wtvq.com/71-ballots-incorrectly-given-out-at-lansdowne-elementary-polling-location-tuesday/"> Fayette County</a>, 71 ballots were given out incorrectly at one polling location. The Kentucky Attorney General’s election hotline received complaints about electioneering in<a href="https://www.richmondregister.com/news/electioneering-hotline-receives-complaints-in-madison-county/article_d612821e-d607-11ec-b4d5-cf5c22497377.html"> Madison County</a>. It was relatively smooth sailing in<a href="https://www.wave3.com/2022/05/17/few-issues-jefferson-co-polling-locations-during-primary-election/"> Jefferson County</a> although adjustments had to be made when some poll workers failed to show up. There were few problems reported in<a href="https://www.wkdzradio.com/2022/05/17/few-problems-reported-in-christian-county-primary-election/news-edge/"> Christian</a> and<a href="https://www.wkdzradio.com/2022/05/17/primary-election-day-off-to-a-smooth-start-in-trigg-county/news-edge/"> Trigg</a> Counties. Issues with a voting machine in one Boone County precinct forced voters to use paper ballots and the county to take extra steps to process those ballots. &#8220;Transparency, election integrity is the most important thing for any election,&#8221;<a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/boone-county/election-integrity-is-the-most-important-thing-officials-count-votes-after-machine-breaks-in-boone-county"> Boone County</a> Clerk Justin Crigler said. &#8220;We need the citizens of being coming to the elections are fair, honest and secure. So we took numerous steps, there&#8217;ll be no questions whatsoever.” This was also the first election that voters could<a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/ky-secretary-of-state-hopes-no-excuse-in-person-early-voting-will-increase-turnout-in/article_d7a838b0-d6e0-11ec-8e35-1b77cefd7712.html"> cast a ballot early without an excuse</a>. Approximately 116,000 Kentuckians took advantage of it. Adams says he hopes to see those numbers go up in future elections. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a long needed improvement, &#8220;Adams said. &#8220;Other states, including our neighboring states, long ago made voting easier and we were stuck in a model from 1891.&#8221;</p>

North Carolina State Board of Elections Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell said that the day had<a href="https://abc11.com/nc-politics-primary-election-board-of-elections-voting/11861310/"> gone smoothly</a> and that officials did all they could to provide a secure and accurate election. &#8220;What we want to make sure is voters know the story behind what happens in elections to increase our transparency. That&#8217;s why North Carolinians will find the most robust data available for public consumption on our state website of any state elections office is my understanding,&#8221; Bell said.<a href="https://carolinapublicpress.org/53866/1-4m-nc-voters-cast-ballots-in-smooth-running-primary/"> Surry County</a> officials had been concerned about potential conflicts due to months of harassment at county board meetings, but fortunately that did not pan out on primary day. “It has been fantastic,” said Michella Huff, Surry County’s elections director. “We’ve had no real incidents, no threats, no anything.” <a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/mecklenburg-county-website-experiences-issues-local-election-results-slow-release/2UDO2QDACNE3HEJ5DT2NQCWAKA/">Mecklenburg County’s</a> website went down around 9:45pm and the county had to refer people to the state site for results.</p>

And while that remained the case for most of Oregon’s 36 counties, there were a few issues. A U.S. Postal Service mail collection box was stolen in Southeast Portland earlier this month and<a href="https://katu.com/news/local/usps-mailbox-stolen-in-se-portland-county-asks-voters-to-check-ballot-status"> Multnomah County</a> Elections officials are urged voters to contact them immediately if they used it. At least two people reached out to the county when they didn’t receive any notifications about the status of their ballots from the county’s ballot tracking system. While elections officials had worried about low turnout in the weeks leading up to the primary according to the secretary of state’s office<a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2022/05/18/turnout-surged-in-final-days-as-oregon-voters-continued-trend-of-voting-late/"> turnout surged</a> in the final two days of voting.<a href="https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/18/2022-primary-election-results-marion-clackamas-county/65356416007/"> Marion County</a> experienced problems reporting election results to the state Tuesday night. Marion County Clerk Bill Burgess said county officials missed a step in posting a file to the Secretary of State&#8217;s website. While county election results were posted on its own website soon after 8 p.m., those results were not included as part of the larger state tallies until later Tuesday night. And in<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/05/18/clackamas-county-votes-delay-ballot-counting-primary-election-2022/"> Clackamas County</a>, a printing error on ballot barcodes will have the county processing and counting ballots well into next week. “We are talking about working this weekend, and I plan to do that, but we need enough staff to do that,” County Clerk Sherry Hall said. “I’m not sure if I can force them to work or if they have to be willing.” The county chair is<a href="https://katu.com/news/local/clackamas-county-elections-oregon-getting-help-to-address-unacceptable-delay-in-counting-blurry-barcode-ballots-duplicating-primary-election"> diverting 200 county employees</a> who volunteered to help process the ballots. They&#8217;ll be working from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day, each taking six-hour shifts until the job is done. Additionally, state officials have reached out to Yamhill and Washington counties about bringing in elections workers who are trained to use the same system as Clackamas County. The county has until certification day, June 13, to fully reprocess the misprinted ballots and close out the election results.</p>

We&#8217;re good at it,&#8221; said Miller. A number of polling places in<a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/multiple-polling-places-reporting-shortage-republican-ballots-voters-turned-away/GCVUMMEOQ5C75I7GBEO5K3KQOM/"> Allegheny County</a> reported ballot shortages.

With all the rhetoric leading up to the election, there was fortunately only one reported incident of violence towards elections officials. In a polling place in<a href="https://triblive.com/local/castle-shannon-man-accused-of-harassing-intimidating-poll-workers/"> Castle Shannon</a>, a man was arrested for harassing and intimidating poll workers. According to police reports, David Huff, 57, was yelling at and filming voters, police said. Voting temporarily stopped because of Huff’s erratic behavior, the complaint states. As happens somewhere every election day, a locked door in<a href="https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/lehighvalley/locked-building-delays-start-of-voting-in-whitehall/article_7d4c8044-d5da-11ec-8997-bb7799fd30fb.html"> Lehigh County</a>, caused a polling place to open late when no one could access the building.<a href="https://www.butlereagle.com/20220517/new-polling-places-dont-deter-county-voters/"> Butler County</a> elections officials reported no problems with new polling places following redistricting.  <a href="https://www.wtae.com/article/versailles-poll-worker-final-election/40038225">Allegheny County</a> poll worker Sara Coban has worked her last election after serving at the polls for 68 years. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be 94 years old in June, and I think it&#8217;s high time that I hang it up and start living our life,&#8221; Coban said. Elections are serious business but that doesn’t’ mean you can’t have some fun and that’s exactly what Amy Michalic, a judge of elections has done at her<a href="https://observer-reporter.com/news/localnews/monongahela-polling-place-brings-fun-to-election-day/article_274f5d30-d5ec-11ec-b90d-43515b41d7c5.html"> Monongahela County</a> polling place. Each election she chooses a theme—this week it was the tropics—and poll workers can dress accordingly and the polling place is decorated to fit the theme. “It makes voting a cheerful event again with the way the world has become,” Michalic said. “We had to bring some fun back. How can you be in a bad mood when you come in and you see these smiling faces?”</p>

Since then, the federal government has been called on to help state and local election officials shoulder some of the financial burdens of conducting elections, but until now, the federal government has served as a reactive insurer of last resort. Marshaling the resources needed to conduct the 2020 election brought this question to the fore: Is it time for the federal government to change this approach to supporting elections by partnering with state and local governments to ensure that elections are accessible and secure for all?</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8388" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DuPageCoIL2022-300x114.png" alt="" width="300" height="114" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DuPageCoIL2022-300x114.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DuPageCoIL2022-1024x389.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DuPageCoIL2022-768x292.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DuPageCoIL2022-1536x584.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DuPageCoIL2022.png 1578w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Move to Vote Centers:</strong> DuPage County will become the<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/naperville-sun/ct-nvs-dupage-vote-anywhere-st-0513-20220512-e2ujyiwkhnarbalgjzguc7ucwi-story.html"> first county in Illinois to implement vote centers</a>. The county will allow voters to cast their ballots at any of the 263 polling places open on Election Day. Clerk Jean Kaczmarek told the Chicago Tribune that DuPage voters may cast their primary ballot on June 28 at any polling location, whether it’s in their home precinct, near their job or school, or anywhere else, because new equipment allows individualized ballots to be printed on demand. From talking with election judges and poll watchers, Kaczmarek said voters often show up at the wrong location, in part because a handful of polling places change each election.  That was especially true during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when some locations declined to serve as polling places, she said. “DuPage voters will no longer be turned away on Election Day for being in the wrong polling place in the county,” Kaczmarek said. The only residents not able to take advantage of this are those in Naperville who live in Will County. Kaczmarek said she’s gratified the county is able to offer so many ways to vote. “I want the people of DuPage County to have so many voting options that they’re practically tripping over them,” she said.</p>

Early Voting drew the 5 post position which is in the middle of the 9-horse field. The Preakness is the shortest of the Triple Crown races at only 1 3/16 miles and some expect Early Voting will take an early lead, but just like early voting turnout, what that means for the entire race is anyone’s guess.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) introduced a bill to<a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/3493562-klobuchar-warren-introduce-bill-to-provide-20-billion-for-election-administration/"> provide $20 billion in federal fundin</a>g to help states and localities to administer elections, train poll workers and eliminate barriers to voting. The legislation, which is co-sponsored by nine other Senate Democrats, would secure election infrastructure by upgrading voting equipment and registration systems, help recruit and train nonpartisan election officials and poll workers, protect election officials from threats and increase ballot access for minorities, voters with disabilities and those who live overseas or on Indian lands. “Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, but in recent years we have seen a barrage of threats seeking to undermine our elections,” said Klobuchar. “It is critical that we respond to these threats head-on by ensuring that state and local governments have the resources needed to strengthen the administration of our elections, protect election officials on the frontlines, and provide all eligible voters with the opportunity to make their voices heard,” she said.</p>

The measures approved, which have all already passed the Senate, make changes to election procedures. One would raise the threshold for triggering an<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/05/17/arizona-would-likely-see-recounts-after-every-election-under-popular-bill/"> automatic recount</a> in close elections. Another would require the Game and Fish Department to hand out voter registration links or forms when people sign up for hunting and fishing licenses. A third bill aims to requires court clerks to report new felony convictions monthly so voter registrations can be canceled. And a fifth directs county election officials to count and publicly report the number of uncounted early ballots on election night, if practical.  Meanwhile, lawmakers voted down a handful of bills that were universally opposed by Democrats, in part because there weren’t enough Republican lawmakers on hand to pass bills without Democratic votes. One failed bill would allow people to carry their mail ballot to a polling place, show identification and have their ballot tabulated on the spot as if they had voted in person. Democrats said not all counties have the technology to do that, so the bill risks creating disparate procedures across the state.  Another failed bill would make it a felony to forward a mail ballot to someone known to be registered to vote in another state.</p>

The requirement, part of a larger elections bill, passed the House on a party-line 97-47 vote. In addition to requiring photo ID, the bill allows Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a Republican, to review the list of registered voters in any jurisdiction. Electronic voting machines will be banned after 2024, except in cases where a voter with a disability cannot use a paper ballot. Those machines, however, would be required to have a paper trail for a potential election review. In addition, local election authorities can no longer accept funding from outside organizations. Missouri lawmakers also stripped all of the state’s provisions that made it easier for individuals to vote during the early days of the pandemic. Democrats were able to secure some of their election-related priorities, including a two-week window for no-reason absentee voting.</p>

Chris Sununu. The GOP-led State Senate endorsed the House’s version of SB 418 along party lines. Under the bill, new voters in the state who register without proper identification would use a marked provisional ballot. If those voters failed to then provide proof of identity to the New Hampshire Secretary of State’s office within 7 days, their ballots would be scrubbed and final vote tallies updated. Warren Sen. Bob Giuda, a sponsor of the bill, predicted its effect will be minimal. Sununu had initially signaled opposition to the bill, in part because affidavit ballots could delay final election results by more than a week in a close race. He recently told reporters he is now comfortable with the plan, which has been narrowed to apply only to people who are registering to vote in New Hampshire for the first time. The measure has the support of Sec. of State Dave Scanlan, but has faced criticism from some local election officials and voter advocacy groups as unnecessary. If signed into law, the measure could face a legal challenge.</p>

The legislation includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A3822 which requires county boards of elections to release a online list of the number of ballots received, the number of ballots counted, and the number of ballots left to be counted, a tabulation which would be updated daily. The Secretary of State’s office would aggregate those numbers and list them on its own website – a significant advancement for a state that has long delegated its election reporting to county governments. Additionally county boards of election would be permitted to begin processing and counting mail-in ballots five days before the election, potentially allowing for a much more efficient counting process. And second, postmarked mail-in ballots would have to be received within three days after Election Day, rather than six. Another shift made by the bill would be to move the deadline for printing mail-in ballots from 50 days before the election to 45 days, which some testifiers noted could conflict with federal law about mailing ballots to overseas voters. Finally, the bill would remove the ability of voters to change their partisan registration at the Motor Vehicle Commission, which has some voter registration systems in place through automatic voter registration, and would allow county boards of election to establish schedules for picking up mail-in ballots from ballot drop boxes.</li>
<li>A3819 under a voter on the permanent vote-by-mail lists who does not vote in four consecutive general elections would be removed from the permanent list and be notified by mail of their removal. (Importantly, the voter would remain on the voter rolls, just not on the mail-in list.) Additionally, if a voter indicates they want their vote-by-mail ballot to be delivered to a secondary address – common among college students, for example – but two mail-in ballots in a row are returned or undeliverable, future mail-in ballots will be sent to the voter’s primary address instead, again with a notification by mail of the change. The bill also includes a $10 million education campaign to inform voters of the new rules.</li>
<li>A3817 would require early and absentee votes to be counted by election district, rather than just by municipality. Currently, all Election Day votes are broken out into highly detailed district-level detail but other votes are lumped together at the municipality level, making it impossible to precisely determine detailed election results in elections with high rates of early and absentee voting.</li>
<li>A3820 would require independent voters wishing to vote in closed primaries to to send a separate request for a partisan ballot or go to the polls in-person and cast a provisional ballot. Also included in the bill are provisions to send notifications to those unaffiliated voters informing them of how to affiliate with a party and to require that absentee ballot envelopes be designed so that partisan registration is not visible from the outside.</li>
<li>A3821 would increase the accessibility of early voting and ballot drop box locations. Each county would be required to place at least 50% of its early voting locations and ballot drop boxes in municipalities that had low voter turnout rates, and at least 50% in locations accessible via public transportation.</li>
<li>A3823 would require that municipalities notify statewide voter registration authorities of death records every two weeks in the two months leading up to a statewide election, something designed to increase the security of voter rolls but that several testifiers argued could lead to valid voters being inadvertently purged. The bill would also enter the state into the Electronic Registration Information Center.</li>
<li>A1696 would expand the hours which 16- and 17-year olds are allowed to work at the polls to 5:30am to 9:30pm on Election Day only.</li>

Lewis Voting Rights Act of New York</a> (NYVRA), moved for the first time last week since it was introduced in 2020. The legislation cleared the Senate elections committee and is expected to be heard next in the Senate finance committee – a sign that it may make it to the floor of the State Senate, where it would be virtually assured to pass. But the bill still faces an uphill battle in the Assembly, where supporters are less hopeful. Both chambers are led by Democratic supermajorities. The NYVRA is intended to fill gaps in the federal Voting Rights Act, which the U.S. Supreme Court has largely dismantled over the last decade. The bill would give the New York Attorney General &#8220;preclearance&#8221; authority over any proposed changes to voting in parts of the state with a history of disenfranchisement (the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan had previously been covered under the federal VRA). That authority could apply to anything from the placement of poll-sites to the provision of interpreters. The legislation would also make it easier to file lawsuits against the state or counties for violating the voting rights of protected racial, ethnic, or linguistic groups. And it contains provisions to discourage voter intimidation, require language access, and track potential rights violations.</p>
<p>Better training for elections workers, allowing the distribution of snacks for voters waiting in line and blocking elections commissioners from holding elected office are among the changes Democratic lawmakers in the state Senate are seeking to the administration of elections in New York state.  And key to the package of measures is a plan to overhaul the<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/binghamton/ny-state-of-politics/2022/05/17/new-york-senate-seeks-changes-at-boards-of-elections"> New York City Board of Elections</a> by reducing its size and giving more power to an executive director chosen through a nationwide search.  The measures, approved in the state Senate, are meant to make improvements to local boards of election in New York that have, at times, been criticized as patronage mills for local officials. New York lawmakers in recent years have sought changes to election administration, but have to run into institutional headwinds opposed to the changes. The package of measures includes having the statewide Board of Elections develop a mandatory training plan for election commissioners and key staff at local boards. Elections commissioners would also be barred from holding elected office. Pay raises would also be approved for elections inspectors from $25 to $50.</p>

Michael Skindell (D-Lakewood) recently introduced<a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA134-HB-641"> House Bill 641</a> which would create a<a href="https://www.publicnewsservice.org/2022-05-16/civic-engagement/measure-aims-to-streamline-absentee-voting-in-ohio/a79096-1"> permanent absentee voter list</a>. To vote absentee under current law, voters must fill out an absentee-ballot request and send it to the board of election before each election. They will then receive a mail-in ballot that must be returned. Skindell said the list would streamline the process, which would increase voter participation. &#8220;Instead of having to remember the election and mailing in an application to get a ballot,&#8221; said Skindell, &#8220;you can be placed on a list and the board of election will send you out a ballot application before every election.&#8221; Skindell said a voter would be removed from the permanent absentee list if their registration is canceled, or if they submit a written request to be removed. And he expects any possible opposition to center around false notions that it would weaken election security.</p>

The legislation was approved largely along party lines 52 to 13. The House bill and the matching version in the Senate were born out of Rhode Island&#8217;s 2020 mid-pandemic attempt to make voting easier for COVID-leery voters.</p>

McMaster signed legislation into law that was passed by the General Assembly which<a href="https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article261331187.html"> establishes early voting</a> in South Carolina. In-person absentee voting has now been replaced with a two-week early voting period. Any voter can visit an early-voting location in their county and vote like they would at their polling place on Election Day. Additionally, the bill would establish a set number of early voting sites in each county and authorize election officials to begin examining and tabulating absentee votes prior to Election Day. The bill was approved after Senators dropped that demand, settling instead for confirmation of the state election director and a process for removing the elections board or its executive director if they fail to enforce and defend or publicly discredit state elections laws. The legislation establishes qualifications for the five commissioners, permits their removal by the governor or through a legal action filed by the House or Senate, and prohibits them from establishing emergency election regulations, like those contemplated during the 2020 election. In addition to appointing a commission chairman, the governor also would appoint a vice chairman who would be ready to take the helm should the chairman be removed, Campsen said. Both the board chairman and vice chairman would serve two-year terms. The bill also sets eligibility requirements for the executive director and limits the director’s term to four years, although a director may be reappointed with approval of the Senate.</p>

Moses, in a 136-page decision, rejected various arguments to throw out the lawsuit filed by Eric Coomer, who was security director at the Colorado-based Dominion Voting Systems. Coomer said he faced death threats after he was baselessly accused of trying to rig the 2020 presidential election in favor of President Joe Biden. Moses<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_8hXF8uBzRaA4eQRE0C6fd7u1KzWgOwO/view?usp=sharing"> wrote</a> that “there is overwhelming evidence that an injunction would serve the public interest because the public is harmed by the spread of defamatory information.”</p>

Ron DeSantis, this week ordered that the ruling remain in effect while the state pursues an appeal. The state had appealed Smith’s temporary-injunction ruling to the 1st District Court of Appeal. That triggered an automatic stay, which put the ruling on hold. But Smith held a hearing Monday and sided with voting-rights groups that requested he lift the stay. With elections supervisors preparing for the Aug. 23 primary elections, Smith pointed to the possibility that an appeal would not be resolved quickly. If the stay were not vacated, that could result in supervisors using the DeSantis-backed map that Smith said violated part of the state Constitution. “It’s crunch time now, and this involves fundamental constitutional rights,” Smith said.

David Perdue’s request to inspect ballots</a> from the November 2020 election, saying his evidence of voting fraud amounts to “conjecture and paranoia.” Perdue’s lawsuit claimed fraud had cost him a chance to defeat Democrat Jon Ossoff in November 2020. Perdue filed the lawsuit against Fulton County officials in December — more than a year after the election and four days after he launched his campaign to unseat Gov. Brian Kemp in the May 24 Republican primary. He has made false election fraud claims a centerpiece of his campaign. McBurney dismissed the lawsuit and Perdue’s request for a “forensic inspection” of absentee ballots. The judge said Perdue’s claims consisted of “speculation, conjecture and paranoia — sufficient fodder for talk shows, op-ed pieces and social media platforms, but far short of what would legally justify a court taking such action.” McBurney ruled that Perdue had failed to state a proper claim for relief. The judge noted that Perdue could have filed a proper election challenge following the vote in November 2020, but he did not. Judges rejected several election challenges filed by Trump and his supporters.</p>

The order is in response to the state’s attempt to dismiss the case after a month of testimony. Jones had been considering the state’s request that he throw out the case. Attorneys for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger argued that the plaintiffs, which include voting rights groups and churches, failed to prove their allegations that the state’s voting policies disenfranchise voters. The trial is scheduled to last into June, and then Jones could issue a judgment later this summer.</p>

Giddings petitioned the judge for an ex parte motion, essentially an emergency ruling that would allow her volunteers to begin showing up at early voting locations and ballot collection sites immediately, before allowing those named in the suit a legal chance to respond. &#8220;After reviewing the petition and the motion, the Court is unpersuaded that there is any substantial reason to proceed on an ex parte basis, especially not when counsel for Respondents (Idaho Secretary of State Lawerence) Denney and (Chief Deputy Chad) Houck is in place and wishes to participate,&#8221; Scott wrote. The judge did not make a determination on whether Giddings or Denney made the correct interpretation of the Idaho statutes on poll watchers. Scott made a verbal ruling dismissing Giddings&#8217; petition, and said he would issue a &#8220;short, confirmatory written ruling in the next day or two.&#8221;</p>

State law allows a recount if there is a difference of less than 1% in the vote between candidates. Financial adviser Josh DeTar was the closest with 2,339 votes to Evans’ count of 2,326. DeTar received 20.16% of the vote while Evans received 20.03%, which put the difference at less than 1%.

In a 4-1 decision, the court reversed an injunction granted in April by a district court judge who had ruled in favor of the Democratic Party, Native American organizations and a coalition of youth advocacy groups that are suing to overturn several laws enacted by Republicans in 2021. As a result, voters must now be registered to vote by noon on June 6, the day before the upcoming primary election. And voters casting their ballots in person can’t do so by relying solely on their student ID, as was the case before the laws were passed in 2021. Stand-alone forms of ID that will allow Montanans to vote in person include: Montana driver’s licenses, Montana state ID, a military ID, tribal photo ID, U.S. passport or a Montana concealed carry permit. The order was signed by justices Dirk Sandefur, Jim Shea, Beth Baker and Jim Rice. Chief Justice Mike McGrath &#8220;would deny the motion,&#8221; the order states. The plaintiffs have argued that the new laws are unconstitutional because they disproportionately burden voters from certain groups, including college students, Native Americans, elderly and disabled voters. Jacobsen, a Republican, has sought to uphold the new laws, arguing that they were designed to bolster the state’s election security and were within the Legislature’s authority to determine the state’s election processes. One of the plaintiffs in the case, Montana Youth Action, argued that reversing the injunction would create more confusion for voters, as it would effectively be the third time the rules have changed. “However, we place greater weight on the fact that elections have actually been conducted under the statutes as enacted … elections that a large portion of Montana voters participated in,” the justices wrote. They added that &#8220;the purpose of equitable injunctive relief is to preserve the status quo and minimize the harm to all parties pending final resolution on the merits,” the justices wrote, defining the “status quo” as the “last actual, peaceable, noncontested condition which proceeded” the lawsuit.</p>

The VoteRef.com website does not list details of how people voted regarding candidates or initiatives. Eddie Greim, an attorney for Voter Reference Foundation, urged a federal judge to intervene and ensure voter rolls can be published online to provide direct accountability and allow people to vet the accuracy of most registration records submitted by others. New Mexico election regulators say the unprecedented efforts flouts state statutes that limit the acquisition and sharing of voter registration rolls to governmental activities and political campaigns. An attorney representing the secretary of state&#8217;s office warned that many residents will be reluctant or unwilling to register to vote if they know that required personal information is distributed openly. “People will simply not register if they think we will sell their data or make it available to the world,” said Olga Serafimova, an attorney for the state attorney general and secretary of state. “The system will unravel.” She said election regulators in several states see flaws in the foundation&#8217;s methodology for highlighting “discrepancies” between voting tallies on Election Day and registration records that are updated continually.</p>

The ACLU of Pennsylvania had sued the county after the drop box was removed saying the decision to remove it was made at a meeting that was not open to the public and therefore the county was in violation of Sunshine laws. In his preliminary injunction, Brown stated the commissioners&#8217; decision was an official action, and therefore needed to comply with the Sunshine Act, which states that a government agency needs to provide the public with at least 24 hours’ notice of any official action by posting its agenda on its website. He also rejected the argument from the county that removing the drop box was a &#8220;de minimis&#8221; action. &#8220;The number of public comments related to the drop box and the amount of time the Board itself spent discussing the issue establishes to the satisfaction of the court that the removal of a ballot drop box is not &#8216;so minor as to merit disregard&#8217; and accordingly is not de minimis,&#8221; Brown wrote in his ruling. &#8220;Notably, Board Member D’Agostino suggested at the April 13, 2022 meeting that the matter of the drop box be addressed at a Board meeting the following week, which would have likely satisfied the (state law); however, Board Member Parsons suggested that a consensus existed, and the matter was finalized without a vote.&#8221;</p>

Defendants argue the Sioux tribal plaintiffs and the voting rights organization failed to state a claim for relief and moved for dismissal. “The language of this provision is clear in that ‘all offices in the state that provide public assistance’ must provide the voter registration services described in the NVRA,” Piersol wrote. “Plaintiffs have alleged the Department of Labor and Regulation provides such services and there is evidence to support the allegation.”</p>

The lawsuit, filed by a group of Latino voters and civil rights organizations, alleges violations of the federal Voting Rights Act and an intentional dilution of Latino voters’ influence. It is one of two lawsuits filed over redistricting in the Yakima Valley’s state legislative District 15. The state’s participation in the voting rights lawsuit is necessary to ensure the court could provide relief if needed, U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik said in his May 6 order. The UCLA Voting Rights Project, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Campaign Legal Center, plaintiffs in the voting rights case, have requested that the court prohibit defendants from using the map and order the use of a new plan that does not dilute the strength of area Latino voters in the Yakima Valley.</p>

The Wisconsin Elections Commission in December rejected that complaint, and this lawsuit is an appeal of that decision. Four nearly identical lawsuits are also pending in Milwaukee, Green Bay, Racine and Kenosha. The case in Madison was the first to hold arguments. Three Wisconsin courts have previously rejected similar lawsuits arguing that the grants were illegal. Similar lawsuits filed in other swing states have also been rejected. “It’s sort of a bit like whack-a-mole,” the judge said of the complaint. “This case, my concern is, it just seems like it’s endless. There’s going to be some new allegation.” The judge promised to issue a ruling by the middle of June.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/facts-time-fiction-reporting-truth-amid-lies-and-disinformation">Facts in a Time of Fiction</a>: Journalists have long been charged with sorting fact from fiction through their reporting. But what happens when readers redefine what they see as truth and what they’ll accept as fact?  New York Times writer and author Elizabeth Williamson is among journalists confronting the rampant rise and spread of conspiracy theories through her reporting and research. Her current work has focused around unraveling the targeted misinformation and lies spread after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Conn., the surviving families’ lawsuits against Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and the election disinformation fueling the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack.  In this instructional program with the National Press Club Journalism Institute, Williamson will share her reporting and research process, along with insights she gained as she connected the dots on how conspiracy theories grow. Williamson, whose critically-acclaimed book “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/624175/sandy-hook-by-elizabeth-williamson/">Sandy Hook: An American Tragedy and the Battle for Truth</a>” published this spring, will describe how she threaded together more than 400 interviews, 10,000 pages of court testimony and other records, and on-the-ground reporting to trace a line from conspiracy theories around Sandy Hook to Jan. 6, 2021. Participants will learn to: Identify how misinformation and political conspiracy theories have spread; Work with sensitivity and clarity while reporting on conspiracy theories;  Pre-bunk conspiracy theories through early reporting; Use trauma-informed reporting methods while working with people suffering tragedy; and Organize reporting and deep research to craft a long-form narrative. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> June 10, 11:30am Eastern.</p>
