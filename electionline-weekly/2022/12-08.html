														<p><strong>U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments in <em>Moore v. Harper</em></strong><em><br />
Court&#8217;s decision could upend election administration</em></p>
<p>By David Becker<br />
<a href="https://electioninnovation.org/">Center for Election Innovation and Research</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9099" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCOTUS2-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCOTUS2-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCOTUS2-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCOTUS2-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCOTUS2-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCOTUS2-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The argument in the U.S. Supreme Court in the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/07/1141384831/supreme-court-weighs-controversial-election-law-case">North Carolina redistricting case of <em>Moore v. Harper</em></a> was a veritable “lollapalooza” (as former Solicitor General Neal Katyal noted) for both Supreme Court aficionados and neophytes.</p>
<p>It featured some outstanding lawyering, and many probing and insightful questions from all nine justices, most notably including Justice Thomas, who likely asked more questions in a single hearing than he had in over a decade.</p>
<p>At issue in this case was whether the North Carolina Supreme Court overstepped its authority by invalidating the redistricting maps drawn by the North Carolina General Assembly. The legislature argued not that the North Carolina Supreme Court erred in its interpretation of state law to assess the maps, but rather that the state court was precluded by the terms of the United States Constitution’s Election Clause from restricting the state legislature’s efforts with regard to redistricting or the time, place, and manner of federal elections – <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/03/1130711272/supreme-court-independent-state-legislature-theory-elections-pinckney-plan">a theory called the Independent State Legislature theory</a>, or ISL for short.</p>
<p>Under a robust view of this theory, embraced by the North Carolina legislature, the state courts have no power to review anything that relates to the “time, place, and manner” of federal elections, including Congressional redistricting and federal election policies and procedures. While it’s probably going too far to suggest that application of such a theory would allow a legislature to throw out a popular vote for president, after the election, and award electoral votes to the loser, application of this radical theory could allow for a substantial amount of partisan mischief to affect elections and voters, without the benefit of the added layer of protection of state court review.</p>
<p>And this theory is indeed radical. As noted by Republican election lawyer Ben Ginsberg and many others, this would overturn over 230 years of precedent establishing that state courts could review state legislative decisions under state law. Further, as noted by former federal judge and gifted conservative legal scholar J. Michael Luttig, there is nothing in the textual history of the Constitution that would suggest such a novel interpretation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5632" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SCOTUS-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SCOTUS-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SCOTUS-768x432.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SCOTUS.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This is understandable. As Justice Jackson made particularly clear during the arguments, it would be hard to reconcile an interpretation of the Elections Clause that would forbid state courts from interpreting the state constitutions as necessary to restrict state legislative acts relating to elections, when those very same state constitutions created those state legislatures and defined their responsibilities. And as Justice Kagan noted, it would remove the normal checks and balances on legislative decisions from issues relating to electing the very same people making those decisions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/12/court-seems-unwilling-to-embrace-broad-version-of-independent-state-legislature-theory/">arguments yesterday</a> clearly defined the positions of the justices. There are three justices (Jackson, Kagan, Sotomayor) who appear highly skeptical of the full version of the ISL theory. There are three justices (Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas) who appear ready to give an unprecedented carve out of the system of checks and balances to legislatures acting related to federal elections. And three other justices (Chief Justice Roberts, Barrett, Kavanaugh) appear uncomfortable with this erosion of the constitutional framework of three, co-equal branches of government, but also uncomfortable with giving state courts completely free reign in this area, seeking an alternative where, if a state court acts so irrationally so as to exceed their appropriate role in reviewing legislation, that a federal court could limit their jurisdiction and/or discretion. I hesitate to make predictions, but it seems unlikely the most-extreme version of ISL has a majority on this Court, while it’s likely there’s a majority who will leave open the possibility that a state court could, in extreme cases, overstep its authority to review legislative acts in the context of elections.</p>
<p>For those who have never heard a Supreme Court argument before, and who have three free hours (it was one of the longest Supreme Court oral arguments I’ve ever heard), I highly recommend<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/audio/2022/21-1271"> listening to this one</a>. There was excellent lawyering, particularly from the United States Solicitor General, Elizabeth Prelogar, who was the last of the four attorneys to speak. A decision of the Court is likely to be released in June, 2023.</p>

According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, some voters were hindered by last-minute<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/some-georgia-voters-confused-by-polling-site-changes-lack-of-signs/YJNK6V7VONBTFFDIIZQQG55NSU/"> polling place changes</a>.

An election board member went to the accident site to retrieve the memory cards and check on the workers. &#8220;They seem to be OK to the best of my knowledge right now but we did get the results back. A board member went and picked up the results, brought them back up here for us to upload and then went back to take care of the poll workers,&#8221; Deb Cox, supervisor of elections said. While voting was extended by 20 minutes at one<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/fulton-officials-report-a-great-day-of-runoff-voting/TUNH72HZXFDBVMIJG2QPRR3ZA4/"> Fulton County</a> polling place, overall voting went well in Georgia’s largest county on Tuesday. “Voting was successful with almost no wait times,” Fulton County Interim Elections Director Nadine Williams said.</p>

Recently, the<a href="https://www.wilsonelections.com/news/1670266251/poll-officials-honored/"> Wilson County, Tennessee</a> election commission held a holiday dinner for their poll workers. There was dinner, prizes and games. “This event is a small gesture for us to say ‘thank you’ to the special men and women that make elections in Wilson County so good,” said Administrator of Elections Tammy Smith.” Their smiles, competency and commitment to fair and honest elections is inspiring. The service they provide to the voters of Wilson County is tremendous.” More than 350 Wilson County voters served as poll officials in three elections in 2022. If your county has done something extra special to thank you poll workers and seasonal election workers, let us know and we’ll feature it in the remaining weeks of the year.</p>

And every day we make decisions on their behalf,&#8221; said Councilor Julia Mejia, who co-sponsored the petition. Mostly supported by the council&#8217;s growing number of progressive members, the docket now makes its way to Mayor Michelle Wu&#8217;s desk.

Kathy Hochul (D) has signed a bill into law meant to ensure votes cast by affidavit ballot are still counted, even if the voter appears at the wrong polling place. Votes would still be eligible if the ballot was cast in the correct county and state Assembly district, addressing an issue known as &#8220;<a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ny-state-of-politics/2022/12/06/new-law-meant-to-ensure-affidavit-votes-are-counted-in-new-york">wrong church, wrong pew&#8221; voting</a>. &#8220;Access to the ballot box shouldn&#8217;t be held up by complicated and unclear voting processes,&#8221; Hochul said. &#8220;New York continues to lead the nation in taking critical steps forward to protect the fundamental right to vote. My administration is committed to empowering voters and improving the state&#8217;s electoral process, which has disenfranchised too many New Yorkers for too long.&#8221; The law will require the county and canvassing of affidavit ballots, and not have their vote automatically invalidated.</p>

Under a new version of an elections bill amended by a state Senate committee on Tuesday, mail ballots, also called absentee ballots, would have to arrive by 7:30 p.m. on Election Day in order to be counted. Under current law, absentee ballots can arrive within 10 days after Election Day and still be counted, as long as they are postmarked by the day before the election. The Senate Local Government Committee announced the proposal to end the 10-day acceptance window on Tuesday as it unveiled changes to House Bill 458, which otherwise would largely ban August special elections.</p>

The letter, drafted by Pennington County Commissioner Travis Lasseter and addressed to Gov. Kristi Noem, senators and representatives, the South Dakota Secretary of State and the State Board of Elections, proposed establishing a post-election audit, strengthening codified law language pertaining to voting equipment, and tightening residency requirements for voter registrations, among other things. The draft letter was first presented to the board of commissioners at a special meeting on Oct. 26, a meeting called at the request of evangelist and election integrity skeptic Matthew Monfore to address “elections and machines in Pennington County.” The letter’s original draft outlined five points: establishing a post-election audit committee or post-election criteria for the state, strengthening the requirements of SDCL 12-17B-2, strengthening residency requirements for voter registration, improving voter roll updates, and establishing harsh penalties when election laws are broken. The letter also proposed requiring voters to establish residency for 30 days prior when registering to vote. The letter’s fourth point proposed establishing “harsh penalties” when election laws are broken, reading “public trust will be maintained or restored when they see the law has a penalty if not followed.” The fifth point recommended reviewing the South Dakota voter registration form, to add clarity to the form’s Box 12 — an addition to the original draft letter. Box 12 includes the form’s signature box, as well as an explanation of what the voter is attesting to. The updated draft also removed language about voter roll updates.</p>

County&#8217;s Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, to rule their effort failed to qualify for the ballot. Chalfant said he issued the ruling because at the current pace, the recall committee wouldn’t be able to finish its review for another 18 months. “The Committee has the right to timely determine if the Recall Petition merits a recall election. Without a preliminary injunction, the Committee’s review is expected to take until May 2024,” Chalfant wrote. While declining to set specific access requirements, the judge said he wants the two sides to work together to ensure the recall supporters can complete their review by March 31. He did rule that the registrar must provide access to signatures on file of voters whose signatures were invalidated because of a mismatch.</p>

The signature match requirement is meant to prevent voter fraud, since mail or at-home voting takes place away from a polling site. But, the lawsuit said, fraud is extremely rare, and ballot rejections disproportionately impact diverse communities, disabled people and the youngest and oldest voters. “For the vast majority of Colorado voters who vote by mail this fundamental right is contingent on an arbitrary, deeply flawed signature matching process,” read the lawsuit. “While ostensibly deployed to verify voter identity, signature matching is election integrity theater: it disenfranchises qualified voters by the tens of thousands, all for the appearance — but not the reality — of election integrity.” The lawsuit notes that actual voter fraud is exceedingly rare. A spokesperson for Secretary of State Jena Griswold released a statement: “The Department of State is currently reviewing the lawsuit and will defend Colorado law requiring mail ballot envelopes to be signed. Colorado ensures the constitutional right to cast a ballot, including by giving voters 8 days after an election to fix any signature discrepancy.”</p>
<p>A group of voters has<a href="https://www.montrosepress.com/only-a-one-vote-change-in-montrose-county-s-cd3-recount-as-requests-to-halt/article_4e78e160-7687-11ed-9d89-8b0a0e13dc8e.html"> filed an emergency petition</a> with the Colorado Supreme Court over the CD3 automatic recount. The petitions, filed by attorney Gary Fielder on behalf of electors in Mesa, Garfield, Alamosa, Eagle and Pueblo counties, ask the court to determine that Secretary of State Jena Griswold exceeded her rule-making authority and violated election law concerning how pre-recount testing of machines is to take place. The petitioners argue that the logic and accuracy testing of voting devices she ordered to take place for the recount was not the correct method of pre-recount testing. Instead, they said, the law requires a comparison of actual voter-verified paper against a voting machine’s tabulation, which would either validate the machine’s accuracy, or, when there are discrepancies, create the presumption for a recount by hand. Although a recount can be conducted in the same manner as the original election if the comparison between manually counted ballots and the machine’s tabulation is identical, that’s not the case when there are discrepancies, the petitioners argued.</p>

Ron DeSantis’ elections police, the third case to fall apart since the governor announced the arrests. Stuzin reached the same conclusion as another Miami judge did in a different voter’s case, saying that statewide prosecutors didn’t have the ability to bring charges against Ronald Lee Miller. Because he was convicted of second-degree murder in 1990, Miller, 58, was ineligible to vote. But after his voter registration application was cleared by the Florida Department of State, Miami-Dade’s supervisor of elections issued him a voter ID card, and he voted in November 2020. Statewide prosecutors said Miller’s alleged crimes happened in multiple jurisdictions because he registered to vote through a third-party voter registration organization, which sent the application to Broward County’s election supervisor, which was then sent to Tallahassee. Stuzin flatly rejected that argument in a brief three-page order, writing that state law governing the statewide prosecutor “is clear on its face and unambiguous.” Miller “never physically entered” Broward or Leon counties and “never mailed or electronically transferred anything” to either of those counties, she ruled.</p>

Two absentee voters represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia sued the Cobb County Board of Elections after the department allegedly failed to send out over 3,400 absentee ballots on time for the runoff election. It’s the second time the department has been sued over the same issue — after failing to send out more than 1,000 absentee ballots in the November general election. The election board’s attorney, Daniel White, said the lawsuit is “factually incorrect” and that all the absentee ballots were sent according to the legal deadlines. “We disagree that they were untimely mailed. They’ve all been mailed,” White said. “There’s no statute that’s been violated in terms of the deadlines.” Georgia law requires issuance of absentee ballots within three business days of receiving the application during the advanced voting period. But during the runoff, thousands of ballots marked as issued on Nov. 23 still had not been received by voters in early December, according to the lawsuit.</p>

In a filing last month, the groups asked the high court to consider whether the 14th Amendment prohibits racial discrimination in redistricting when a minority group is not large enough to make up the majority of a district. “If the Kansas Supreme Court’s opinion were to stand it would make it basically impossible to raise an intentional discrimination claim under our equal protection laws,” said Sharon Brett, legal director at the ACLU of Kansas. It’s unclear if the court would take on the case or when they will make that decision.</p>

However, some legal groups say that constitutional provisions in the state must be reviewed and struck down. “Mississippi is keeping a provision of the 1890 constitution in place that everyone agrees was racially discriminatory when it was adopted,” described Deputy Director of Impact Litigation for the Mississippi Center for Justice Paloma Wu. The Mississippi Center for Justice is asking that the U.S. Supreme Court take a look at the case involving Mississippi disenfranchising crimes. Other legal groups have filed similar cases that are also still caught up in court. And two of those groups, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, signed a brief last week encouraging the justices to consider this issue. There has been a simultaneous push for lawmakers to get rid of the ban while it’s pending in the judicial system. “You would like to see us take action to do this,” noted the Director of Political Campaigns for the Southern Poverty Law Center Action Fund, Brandon Jones. “But in the absence of that, we would like to see the courts take this way, put us on the same footing that other states have with a reasonable restoration process.”</p>

Russ Barger, a candidate for the District 26 legislative seat, which represents northeast Lincoln, filed the lawsuit on Monday. His opponent, George Dungan, won by 224 votes, which is just over the margin needed to require an automatic recount. In the lawsuit, Barger said he filed a petition for a hand recount to Evnen last Friday but was denied the request. Instead, Evnen said the recount would be done by a vote-counting device on Thursday, according to court documents. Barger then filed the lawsuit, hoping a court would force the state to do a hand recount of the legislative race. Barger’s lawyer, David Begley, has asked the court to make a decision by Dec. 20. “The Secretary of State is required to certify the election results by December 20. His interpretation of the relevant statute renders many parts of the statute meaningless,” Barger said in a press release. “Clarification of the rights of candidates is important for this race and future races. An election contest lawsuit should not be necessary to secure a hand count. But that will be the only possibility for a hand count, if the court adopts the Secretary of State’s interpretation.”</p>

Trenton City Clerk Brandon Garcia had certified the results of the November 8 non-partisan municipal election based on numbers provided to him by Mercer County election officials.  But on Thursday afternoon, just two hours before a court hearing was set to begin, County Counsel Paul Adezio filed a revised certification showing that the county was able to establish the total number of voters in  the at-large race. “Per the clearest statutory command, petitioners are entitled to a runoff,” Lougy wrote in his decision.  “The delating of the runoff election affords enough time for election officials that voters across the city have fair and equal access to the right to vote.”</p>

The petitions, which were filed last month on behalf of 94 voters who alleged that voting machines were changing votes cast for Republican candidates to Democrats on the ballot, delayed the certification. The GOP claimed some voters had pressed the button for one candidate and the machine lit up another, forcing them to re-select their pick. The party sought a recount in 30 of the county&#8217;s precincts. County officials said it was possible to miss the button, but they were confident nobody&#8217;s vote was changed.</p>
<p>Two voters identifying themselves as members of the conservative Lycoming County Patriots organization want the court to<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/12/lawsuit-seeks-forensic-audit-of-2020-election-results-in-pa-county.html"> order a third-party forensic audit</a> of the November 2020 election results in the county. Richard Houser and Catherine Burns in a suit filed this week in county court claim they have shown the county commissioners over the past 14 months evidence of fraud, irregularities and violations of the Election Code. Their suit names as defendants the county, its three commissioners, board of elections and elections director Forest Lehman. Houser and Burns in their suit seek a court order requiring the Elections Board to report all suspicious activity uncovered by the forensic audit to the district attorney.</p>

The suits urged the court to undo the certification of the county’s Nov. 8 election results, direct that hand recounts be conducted in certain precincts and order that all equipment used in the election be secured and analyzed by a third-party to ensure “full transparency.” Following a nearly 3-hour hearing, Weimer ruled that the lawsuits were without merit and dismissed them “with prejudice,” meaning they can’t be refiled.</p>
