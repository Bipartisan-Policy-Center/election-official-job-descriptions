							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election Center announces new leadership</strong><br />
<em>Joe Gloria and Tammy Patrick will serve as co-CEOs</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>This week,<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/index.php"> The Election Center</a> (National Association of Election Officials) announced that Joe Gloria and Tammy Patrick will serve as co-CEOs for the organization. Patrick will serve as CEO of Programs and Gloria will serve as CEO of Operations.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7370" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Election-Center-300x93.png" alt="" width="300" height="93" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Election-Center-300x93.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Election-Center-768x239.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Election-Center.png 882w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The duo will replace Tim Mattice who is retiring at the end of the year after serving as executive director since 2015, although he began working at the Election Center in 2006 [more to come on that in Exit Interview in the coming weeks].</p>
<p>“Both Tammy and Joe are respected members of the election community bringing years of election experience as well as being valued members of the Election Center. We are confident they will bring great energy and ideas to the Election Center,” said Susan Gill, chair of the Board for the Election Center.</p>
<p>Gloria and Patrick will be only the third chief executives for the organization which began back in the mid-80s.</p>
<p>According to Tom Wilkey, vice-chair of the board of directors and one of the original members of the board, a small group of election officials gathered in Washington DC in 1986 to talk about forming a national association of election officials which today is the Election Center.</p>
<p>The organization’s first director was Doug Lewis, followed by Mattice.</p>
<p>“Today we enter on a dynamic new journey in our history with the selection of Tammy Patrick and Joe Gloria as our new leadership team who will carry us into the future,” Wilkey said.</p>
<p>Wilkey noted that the selection process was a long, deliberative process over many months of painstaking review of an excellent pool of candidates.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9077" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/TPat.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/TPat.jpg 200w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/TPat-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />“After much soul searching the board of directors made a very wise decision in asking Tammy and Joe to use their many years of work in the forefront of election administration to aiding us towards a new and exciting time in the future of our organization serving election officials all across our nation,” Wilkey said.</p>
<p>Patrick, who begins work at the Election Center on December 1, most recently served as a senior advisor to the<a href="https://democracyfund.org/"> Elections Program at the Democracy Fund</a>, she also served as a commissioner on President Barack Obama’s<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/the-presidential-commission-on-election-administration/"> Presidential Commission on Election Administration</a>. Prior to that she worked in the Maricopa County, Arizona elections department.</p>
<p>“The field of election administration has changed dramatically since I began in 2003&#8211;there are more challenges now than ever before. The strength of our allegiances, of our alliances, of our associations, will guide us through,” Patrick said. “As an Election Center member for almost twenty years, I am honored to join the indominable Joe Gloria in shepherding the organization into its next chapter.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-9076" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gloria-Joseph_pic-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="223" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gloria-Joseph_pic-240x300.jpg 240w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gloria-Joseph_pic.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 178px) 100vw, 178px" />Gloria will begin at the Election Center on February 1, 2023 following a much-deserved break after shepherding<a href="https://www.clarkcountynv.gov/government/departments/elections/services/elections_and_voting.php"> Clark County, Nevada</a> through the 2022 Midterm Election. Gloria comes to the Election Center with more than 30 years in election administration, supporting more than 150 election cycles. Gloria has been the face of election administration nationally during some of the most challenging and demanding election events in our nation’s history.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to have two nationally recognized leaders from the elections field take on executive leadership roles for the Election Center at such a crucial time in our nation’s history,” said Dean Logan, board member and registrar-recorder/county clerk,<a href="https://www.lavote.gov/"> Los Angeles County</a>. “Building community and support with and for election administrators has always been the strength of the organization. Tammy and Joe are uniquely positioned to build on that foundation.”</p>
<p>The Election Center currently has more than 1,500 active members. Many of whom expressed their excitement about the new leadership at the organization.</p>
<p>“I was delighted to learn of the promotion of Tammy Patrick to Chief Executive Officer for Programs of Election Center and Joseph Gloria to Chief Executive Officer for Operations,” said Barb Byrum,<a href="https://clerk.ingham.org/departments_and_officials/county_clerk/"> Ingham County, Michigan</a> clerk. “These are two champions of democracy who have long worked to train our elections administrators and foster the next generation of leaders in this field. I am confident that Tammy and Joseph will elevate Election Center to become even more respected in the industry and I look forward to working with them to achieve our joint goals.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-9081" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Newelectionlinelogo-300x117.png" alt="" width="174" height="68" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Newelectionlinelogo-300x117.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Newelectionlinelogo.png 706w" sizes="(max-width: 174px) 100vw, 174px" />The hiring of Gloria and Patrick to lead the organization aren’t the only recent changes at the Election Center. As readers of electionlineWeekly know, the<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/10-20/"> Election Center recently acquired electionline.org</a> from The Democracy Fund. In addition, the Election Center has expanded its partnership with Auburn University to support elections research activities including the launch of the Journal of Election Administration and Practice.</p>
<p>“As the long-time partners of the Election Center in certification, training, and now research, Auburn University faculty are delighted to welcome the powerhouse combination of Tammy Patrick, Joe Gloria, and Mindy Moretti to the Election Center team. Their deep knowledge of the field and extensive expertise are invaluable as we move forward to meet new challenges,” said Kathleen Hale, board member and director of<a href="https://bulletin.auburn.edu/thegraduateschool/graduatedegreesoffered/publicadministrationandpublicpolicympaphd_major/electionadmin_cert/"> Auburn University’s election administration program</a>.</p>

							<h2>What's Next in GIS?</h2>
														<p><strong>We automated the maps to make elections better. Now what?</strong></p>
<p>By Jamie Chesser, project lead, Geo-Enabled Elections project, NSGIC</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7228" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.12.10-AM-300x87.png" alt="" width="300" height="87" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.12.10-AM-300x87.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.12.10-AM-768x222.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.12.10-AM.png 974w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />When I took the reins at NSGIC’s Geo-Enabled Elections project five years ago, I knew we had our work cut out for us. Election directors, although a dedicated and hard-working group, didn’t necessarily know the benefits of using geographic information systems (GIS) in elections. Some didn’t know their counterparts in their state’s geographic information office. Today, I’m pleased to say, we see a very different picture; many states around the country have come a long way.</p>
<p>Our project’s goal was to elevate the degree to which GIS is integrated in election operations. That may sound like a niche task, but it is not. Maps are critical for elections, and GIS is critical to the accuracy and efficiency of modern elections. In a time when most of us use maps on our phones to find a coffee shop, our country’s elections leaders deserve to have access to similar technology for automatically and correctly pinpointing voters’ and candidates’ locations.</p>
<p>In essence, we’ve facilitated the work to transition from the voter lists and physical maps that elections relied on in the past and enabled systems for effective audits and candidate verification &#8211; and promoted transparency. All to ensure every voter gets the right ballot. GIS also supports routine tasks like getting supplies to voting locations all the way through to &#8211; in exceptional circumstances &#8211; re-routing voters to new voting locations in the case of a natural disaster (Hello Hawaii, 2018!).</p>
<p>All of this work was made possible thanks to pioneer states who shared their learnings and knowledge through mentoring and in case studies, pilot projects, and ultimately in the project’s <a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/best-practices-gis-in-elections/">Best Practices Guidance document</a>.</p>
<p>Teams from those states included collaborators from both elections and GIS offices. One of the critical learnings from this project is, in fact, that collaboration between these departments is key to significant advances in election modernization.</p>
<p>NSGIC’s recent <a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/2022-state-election-director-report-available-now/">State Election Director Report</a> documents some of those advances.</p>
<p>For instance, the 28 election directors who contributed to the report highlighted increased routine audits of their voter address files and boundary maps, many of them reaching the gold standard of using external address sources like the National Address Database, or a Next Generation 911address database. More of them than in past years &#8211; 29% &#8211; now conduct spatial audits using GIS, up from just 9% four years ago. In addition, about half of all participating states and territories today complete real-time updates of voter addresses, compared to mostly daily updates four years ago.</p>
<p>However, election directors in our report also tee up one sizeable challenge for the election and GIS community: Within five years, they project that nearly 90% of states and territories queried will have a voter registration system capable of handling spatial data. Compare that to the number today: fewer than 40% &#8211; and not all of the states who have the capability today are using it.</p>
<p>Such a lift would be laudable, as it saves work effort and increases accuracy, but it is no mean feat. However, it is the right thing to do. In the words of one election director:</p>
<p>“It is a lot of work to manage two systems &#8211; GIS and VRS or election management systems. Election offices need one system that they manage.”</p>
<p>In 2019, the Geo-Enabled Elections project <a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/hava-funding-gis/">shared requests-for-proposals</a> intended to help states specify new voter registration systems that can handle GIS data.</p>
<p>We are unsure how many states took advantage of those, and are now in the process of upgrading to new voter registration systems &#8211; possibly using HAVA funds. Securing funding for election modernization can be a hurdle; some states have found that reframing the issue as one of cost savings can help. In the words of one election director in the State Election Director Report:</p>
<p>“Determine the value within your state for geo-enabled elections. Share that value with key stakeholders and decision-makers. The value likely is monetary, which translates to FTE(s) in elections that have GIS knowledge and software skills, securing the use of the technology now and into the future.”</p>
<p>Redistricting is coming up in 2031; too early? Perhaps for some &#8211; however, the fact is that advances made in election modernization today will make that process smoother and less demanding on election officials’ time.</p>
<p>Overall, election directors in our report rate their degree of current integration of GIS information with election data systems at a 5 out of 10, perhaps foreshadowing the major lift ahead.</p>
<p>What is remarkable to me and a testament to the dedication of everyone involved in elections is that despite all the turmoil and turn-over in the elections space during the project’s five-year term  &#8211; 52% of states saw a change in election leadership during 2017-2022 &#8211; there was still so much progress made on elections modernization. That progress makes me confident that a rapid increase in voter registration systems that can handle GIS information is achievable by 2027, before the 2028 presidential election.</p>
<p>How can states that are in the thick of this find resources and community? <a href="https://nsgic.memberclicks.net/2022-elections-geosummit">Join us at the Elections GeoSummit to learn more</a>.</p>
<p>On Dec 8, from noon till  2 p.m. ET, we will hear from Vermont, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Montana about their recent journeys towards geo-enabled elections; we will review the challenges ahead and the resources to get there. My prediction regarding one of the findings: commitment, collaboration, and growth will be key to unlocking success in years to come. It is also the theme for this year’s Elections GeoSummit. Join us there.</p>

In<a href="https://www.wabe.org/condensed-runoff-timeline-is-helping-fuel-georgias-daily-early-voting-records/"> Georgia</a>, the U.S. Senate runoff is seeing record-breaking early voting turnout, however it’s not necessarily a sign of voter enthusiasm. Georgia’s new voting law condensed the runoff to four weeks. The law left a short window to return an absentee ballot and fewer days for early voting than during the nine-week runoff in 2021. So more people are lining up to vote early, in-person at once, especially in metro Atlanta, where wait times have been an hour or more at some early voting locations. Georgia’s runoff voting concludes on December 6. Early voting in<a href="https://www.ktbs.com/community/early-voting-numbers-disappointing-compared-to-november-primaries/article_a7aef116-7128-11ed-9913-0f2228079294.html"> Louisiana</a> for that state’s December 10 runoff has been relatively low. &#8220;If you&#8217;re looking for the same early voting number we saw with the primary race for mayor. You&#8217;re just not gonna find it. this is a low intensity election. It&#8217;s a low profile election. It&#8217;s just not gonna attract the same kind of numbers that we saw in the primary,&#8221; KTBS political analyst Jeremy Alford said. Several jurisdictions in<a href="https://www.natchezdemocrat.com/2022/11/29/polling-places-remain-open-until-7-p-m-today-for-runoff-election-despite-weather/"> Mississippi</a> held runoff this week and even though there was severe weather in the area and county schools and other public offices closed early, polling places remained open until 7pm. Oktibbeha County Circuit Clerk Tony Rook was<a href="https://www.wcbi.com/area-circuit-clerk-says-voting-will-continue-rain-or-shine/"> ready for whatever</a> Mother Nature had to offer. “In the event that we exhaust the backup power. We are currently working with the emergency management agency director as well as volunteer fire stations to make sure they can deploy backup generators,” said Rook. Voting continues. Voting does not stop.” From coast to coast recounts are occurring in jurisdictions small and large. In<a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2022/11/oops-green-ink-stray-marks-inside-the-largest-hand-recount-in-onondaga-county-history.html"> Onondaga County, New York</a>, the largest hand recount in the history of the county began this week. The recount is expected to last into next week. In<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/michigan/2022/12/01/recount-sought-of-many-michigan-precincts-for-2-ballot-proposals/69690858007/"> Michigan</a> an Oakland County resident filed paperwork and made a deposit to recount votes on an abortion rights ballot proposal in more than 500 Michigan precincts. Additionally, the petitioner sought the recount of 47 precincts with both in person and absentee voting precincts for Proposal 2 which allows nine days of early voting among other elections-related reform.</p>

Alaskans for Honest Government, a political action committee that formed last month has announced it will attempt to do away with ranked choice voting in Alaska by ballot initiative, and former Gov. Sarah Palin was the first to sign the petition. The group hopes to gather enough signatures to put the question of reinstating the state’s former voting system to voters on the 2024 ballot. Ranked choice voting has been found to be constitutional both by the Alaska Supreme Court and in federal court. If certified by the lieutenant governor, the initiative group has a year to collect signatures from qualified registered voters. They must collect a number equal to at least 10% of those who voted in the preceding general election from places representing the majority of the state. Group leaders said they intended to gather more than 40,000 signatures and expected their effort would cost millions of dollars.</p>

The<a href="https://beverlypress.com/2022/11/democracy-square-honors-voter-registration-activist-sylvia-levin/"> Sylvia Levin Democracy Square</a> is located at Fairfax and Rosewood avenues near Canter’s Delicatessen in west Los Angeles. Between 1973 until her death at the age of 92 in 2009 — Levin registered over 47-thousand voters in the city, the county, the state of California and the entire nation. She was recognized by the Secretary of State’s office, the county Registrar-Recorder County Clerk’s Office, the U.S. House of Representatives and the LA City Council for setting registration records. Levin often set up registration tables in several locations in greater LA including the Westwood Federal Building, in front of Canter’s Deli and in Century City. &#8220;This effort has always been nonpartisan , encouraging voter participation, and has never has been more significant than now,&#8221; said Chuck Levin, Sylvia Levin&#8217;s son and a voter registrar himself. &#8221; It is a rare honor by the City Council and the City to create this type of permanent tribute to individuals , this one for democracy and my mother&#8217;s 36 year record setting contribution . It is a wonderful tribute and it means so much . Thank you to my hometown .&#8221;</p>

The<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3740934-lawmakers-advance-bill-to-make-mail-voting-more-transparent/"> Vote by Mail Tracking Act</a> requires that all mailed ballots include a U.S. Postal Service barcode that enables tracking of each individual ballot, as well as meeting other requirements for envelope design and bear an official election mail logo. “I can tell you that during the past election and in 2020 we got hundreds of phone calls from people trying to track their ballots, they wanted to make sure their ballots were cast, and recorded,” said oversight committee chair Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-New York).  “Ensuring Election Officials and voters have the resources to track the status of their ballots would create even more peace of mind and confidence and further protect the sanctity of our elections,” she said.  The bill had bipartisan support, though some Republicans on the panel were skeptical about its effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6916" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Boston-300x183.png" alt="" width="300" height="183" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Boston-300x183.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Boston-1024x626.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Boston-768x469.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Boston.png 1142w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Boston, Massachusetts</strong>: Boston City Council is set to weigh legislation that, if approved, would<a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022/11/28/boston-to-weigh-teenagers-voting-in-local-elections"> allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections</a> for mayor, City Council and city-specific ballot questions. The measure comes before the council as the issue of lowered voting age gains national steam, mostly through the efforts of progressive Democrats. The council, which has become increasingly left-leaning in recent years, is likely to pass the measure this week. But even if the council passes the measure, it has to also be approved at higher levels of government before taking effect. Back Bay Councilor Kenzie Bok is one of the local measure’s six co-sponsors. She said the proposal is meant to expand suffrage and address voter apathy. At 18, many young adults uproot their lives and move to unfamiliar communities. Allowing them to vote earlier, she said, could encourage them to become more civically engaged. The measure would need approval first from the council, then the mayor, then from the state Legislature.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3852" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/OH-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Ohio:</strong> Lawmakers have introduced two pieces of elections-related legislation during the lame duck session. One is an initiative requiring<a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/11/18/ohio-republicans-launch-effort-to-make-constitutional-amendments-harder-to-pass-for-voters/"> citizen-led constitutional amendments</a> gain a 60% supermajority at the ballot for passage, the other is a House bill aimed at rewriting the underlying infrastructure of how the state conducts elections. State Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, joined Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose to introduce their plan that singles out the citizen-led process for amending the state constitution and raises threshold for passage to 60%. The signature threshold for making the ballot would remain unchanged. LaRose argued lifting that benchmark would give the same interest groups a relative advantage. The proposal itself, of course, will need to go to voters and get just 50% plus one to alter the Ohio Constitution. It will follow a different process, too. Stewart’s resolution would make the ballot through a General Assembly vote rather than the citizen signature-gathering process.</p>
<p>Rep. Bill Seitz (R-Green Township),<a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/11/18/ohio-republicans-launch-effort-to-make-constitutional-amendments-harder-to-pass-for-voters/"> proposed sweeping changes to an already sweeping elections bill.</a> The biggest move involved nixing the automated voter registration language contained in the initial proposal. Those provisions would’ve leaned heavily on the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to help voters register or update their registration any time they interact with the agency. If voters’ registration is regularly updated, the thinking goes, there will be fewer names to purge. But Seitz said after months of negotiations, the Ohio Senate hasn’t budged. “If we’re going to get anything done,” Sietz said, “we’ve got to have an agreement between two chambers, and the Senate does not yet feel comfortable with automated voter registration, even though I am comfortable with it.” Among other changes, voters would be able to request absentee ballots online, but they’d have to submit paper requests on a specific form. The deadline for requesting one would be seven days before an election. The bill trims the deadline for absentee ballots to arrive post-election to seven days as well. Drop boxes would be available for the duration of early voting, but they’d be restricted — no more than three, all on board of elections premises and under 24/7 video surveillance. The bill eliminates the final day of early voting but distributes those hours in the week prior by extending weekday hours. Seitz also dropped a number of ID provisions from the original bill. He noted Senate legislation plans to offer free photo-ID to anyone — not just poor Ohioans as his bill envisioned.</p>
<p>A proposal to<a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/11/30/ohio-house-committee-continues-debate-on-nixing-august-special-elections/"> remove August primary elections</a> in Ohio is supported by a prominent conservative group and Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, with both pointing to low voter turnout and high costs. House Bill 458, which passed the Ohio House in 2021, seeks to get rid of August special elections except when a school district is in fiscal emergency or a special U.S. congressional election is necessary. Certain “local offices, questions or issues” can be placed on a ballot if a U.S. House of Representatives special election is required, according to the bill. At the Senate Local Government and Elections Committee, the Buckeye Institute put its support behind the bill, saying restricting the August special election would save taxpayers money and get rid of an event that historically has low turnout.</p>

Charter changes in Vermont must first be approved by city voters and then passed through the state senate and house of representatives as well as receive approval from the governor. The city will have public hearings on the three charter changes before Town Meeting Day for residents. Two of charter changes received unanimously support from the City Council. The ranked-choice voting resolution was opposed by some councilors because of the inclusion of school commissioners and ward election officers. An all-resident voting charter change would allow non-U.S. citizens who reside in Burlington to vote in municipal elections. Voters would need to be legal U.S. residents, 18 or older, have taken the Voter&#8217;s Oath and be registered to vote to participate in elections. The resolution defines a legal resident as &#8220;any non-citizen who resides in the United States on a permanent or indefinite basis in compliance with federal immigration laws.&#8221; The Council voted 7 to 3 to put the question of whether to extend ranked-choice voting to more municipal elections, including mayoral elections, on the ballot in March. If passed, another  charter change would allow City Council to determine polling locations at least 30 days before elections in consultation with the City Clerk&#8217;s Office and ward election officials. A ward&#8217;s polling place could be co-located with another ward&#8217;s polling place as long as each are separate and distinct. A polling place could also be outside ward lines as long as it is within close proximity to the ward.</p>

The changes approve include: Town officers will be elected by Australian ballot; Australian ballot will decide all budget articles and conduct all other business by Australian ballot. If unchallenged, the decisions will end the town’s long-standing tradition of holding an in-person town meeting on the first Tuesday in March where only those voters in attendance decide who is elected to various town offices, what the town budget will be for the coming year, and any other questions put forth for a vote. In order to change a town’s voting format, state law requires that a municipality hold a vote using the town meeting format in place. That’s how the in-person meeting came about.</p>

Pima County Superior Court Judge Casey McGinley signed an order withdrawing the complaint on November 17. Supervisors Tom Crosby and Peggy Judd have for weeks fought to get a full hand recount of approximately 40,000 ballots in their county, even before Election Day, saying the effort was needed to calm fears from their constituents that elections are not legitimate. But McGinley said the county has to recount ballots as required by law, and state law doesn&#8217;t allow arbitrary 100% hand recounts. The recount advocates lost an appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court, and then filed a new suit even though they hadn&#8217;t yet taken a public vote on how to pay their lawyer.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Katie Hobbs’ Office filed a lawsuit against the Cochise County Board of Supervisors for<a href="https://ktar.com/story/5367735/arizona-secretary-of-states-office-files-lawsuit-against-cochise-county/"> failing to meet the required deadline to canvass the election</a>. The complaint states the board didn’t fulfill its duty to certify the election on November 28, which could potentially disenfranchise the voters of Cochise County. Republicans on the rural county board refused to certify the election regardless of no evidence of a count being incorrect. The secretary’s office states in the filing that special action relief was granted, which compels the Cochise County board to canvass the election by Thursday to give Hobbs time to meet the Dec. 5 deadline for the statewide canvass. Failure to do so would mean all votes from the county would be dropped. “The Board of Supervisors had all of the information they needed to certify this election and failed to uphold their responsibility for Cochise voters,” Sophia Solis, a spokeswoman for Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, said in an email.</p>
<p>Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Randall Warner<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/30/judge-dismisses-hamadeh-effort-to-delay-certifying-results-in-ag-race/69683748007/"> dismissed a lawsuit</a> filed by Republican attorney general candidate Abe Hamadeh contesting the results of the Nov. 8 election, finding that the complaint was premature. While dismissed for now, Hamadeh still could file a complaint later, after the expected statewide certification of the election. &#8220;The merits of the lawsuit still stand. We will re-file the case after the statewide canvass,&#8221; said Hamadeh, who was joined in the complaint by the Republican National Committee. Dan Barr, attorney for Democrat Kris Mayes, commented after the complaint was dismissed: &#8220;Their major problem is they still don&#8217;t have any facts to support their lawsuit.&#8221; The judge&#8217;s decision comes a day after a court hearing in which Warner asked the various parties to discuss the timeliness of the lawsuit. While a lawsuit could be filed later, the scope of the complaint would be different.</p>
<p>Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake has filed a lawsuit against elections officials in Maricopa County,<a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/elections/lake-lawsuit-maricopa-county-elections-officials/75-0620bcb8-413a-4953-8440-ee38c3f40de4"> claiming election laws were violated</a> during the General Election earlier this month. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in Maricopa County Superior Court. Lake was defeated in the election by Democrat Katie Hobbs, with Hobbs taking 50.3% of the vote while Lake received 49.7%. The suit is asking the county to produce records regarding the administration of Nov. 8th’s General Election. It cites urgency in requesting prompt disclosure regarding the requested information due to the amount of time remaining to “determine whether the county has violated their (Lake’s) rights or the law and to seek relief.” Listed as defendants in the Lake’s suit are Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, Maricopa County Director of Elections for Election Services and Early Voting Rey Valenzuela, Maricopa County Director of Elections for Election Day and Emergency Voting Scott Jarrett, members of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Bill Gates, Clint Hickman, Jack Sellers, Thomas Galvin, and Steve Gallardo. Complaints listed in the suit include allegations of misprinted ballots that were not readable by voting machines, the mixing of counted and uncounted ballots, long lines at polling locations that discouraged voters from casting ballots, along with other conditions.</p>

During his initial news conference Dist. Atty. George Gascón did not mention that his office’s investigation was sparked by a conversation with one of the founders of True the Vote, a Texas-based nonprofit that has fomented conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. According to the Los Angeles Times, The extent of True the Vote’s involvement in the investigation remains unclear. Co-founder Gregg Phillips initially claimed that he played a “small role” in the probe. Gascón did not acknowledge True the Vote’s involvement in the case at his initial news conference but days later issued a statement confirming that a “report” from Phillips had sparked the probe. In sworn testimony in the Texas defamation case, Phillips said he was first contacted by Neff in July. Phillips said a district attorney’s office investigator was present at an August event hosted by True the Vote.</p>

Brown is one of two employees accused of helping Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters allow a copy of a hard drive to be made during an update of election equipment last year in search of proof of the false conspiracy theories spun by former President Donald Trump. Brown, 45, pleaded guilty to attempting to influence a public servant, a felony, and official misconduct, a misdemeanor, but will not be sentenced until right after she testifies at Peters&#8217; trial next year so her performance on the witness stand can be considered. &#8220;There were things going on that I should have questioned and I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Brown told Judge Matthew Barrett. Brown&#8217;s deal, which Barrett will not decide whether to accept until sentencing, would allow her to serve up to 30 days in jail for the misdemeanor. It would allow the felony conviction to be erased after two years if she complies with conditions he sets, such as requiring community service, for those two years. If Barrett rejects the plea deal, Brown could withdraw her guilty pleas.</p>

On election day, the County Clerk deemed the return envelopes of more than 800 mail in ballots deficient. The County Clerk may deem a return identification envelope deficient if such an envelope is returned unsigned, the affirmation signature does not match the reference signature image or the envelope contains other conditions that would not allow the counting of the ballot. According to the complaint, voters are given five business days after the election to cure deficiencies, but the complaint alleges that the County Clerk did not mail out notices to the affected voters until four days after election day.</p>
<p>The Hawaii Republican Party is suing Chief Elections Officer Scott Nago over claims that the elections office<a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/beat/hawaii-gop-sues-elections-office-over-vote-auditing/"> did not properly audit the tally of votes</a> cast during the November general election. Attorney William Dean, who is representing the Hawaii GOP, said the lawsuit is limited to auditing procedures and that it’s “not intended to be used as a vehicle to overturn the results of the election.” The lawsuit relies on statements from election observers who say that “hand tallies” and other auditing procedures were not followed during a recent audit of the election results. The state has not yet filed a response to the lawsuit.</p>

The ruling came as November 22 marked the final day ballots sent on or before Election Day on Nov. 8 could be verified and counted — with a close race between GOP state Rep. Deanne Mazzochi and Democratic challenger Jenn Ladisch Douglass, both of Elmhurst, hanging in the balance. As of November 22, unofficial vote totals showed Douglass had a 365 vote lead over Mazzochi in the district, which also includes a sliver of western Cook County, 21,960 to 21,595. At issue in the case is how the late-arriving, mail-in ballots were being verified and counted in DuPage County. DuPage County Clerk Jean Kaczmarek filed for an emergency supervisory order from the Illinois Supreme Court to overturn the lower court’s ruling, contending the court could not interfere in the vote counting and that Mazzochi’s actions were premature since she would have an opportunity to contest the election once all ballots were counted. Kaczmarek’s filing warned that Orel’s action “invites political agents of any political association to file unauthorized lawsuits in the midst of counting votes in ongoing elections hoping that an Illinois court will assume the role of an election official and will order the counting of votes in the manner they deem fit.” Kaczmarek has<a href="https://www.shawlocal.com/my-suburban-life/news/dupage-county/2022/11/23/dupage-clerk-appeals-order-on-how-to-verify-disputed-signatures-on-mail-in-ballots/"> appealed</a> the ruling.</p>

The judge says the allegations listed in Carstensen’s petition to the court about voting machine irregularities and incorrect redistricting maps didn’t meet court standards and lacked required details.</p>

The man, James D. Holkeboer, went as far as inserting a thumb drive into an electronic poll book to obtain voter information and compare it to a public records request he filed. From there, he planned to look for any discrepancies, the detective told a judge Monday during a preliminary examination hearing. Holkeboer was bound over to Kent County Circuit Court for trial on charges of falsifying records/returns under election law and using a computer to commit a crime, a Grand Rapids judge ordered Nov. 28. “He’s a part of the problem of information going out that there’s election fraud,” Kent County Assistant Prosecutor Felix Tarango told District Judge Sara Smolenski during a preliminary examination hearing. A trial date was not immediately scheduled. As of Monday, Holkeboer remains free on bond.</p>

Green granted a motion by Kent County Clerk Lisa Posthumus Lyons to quash Lindell’s subpoena. The judge said Lindell’s request was unduly burdensome and ordered Lindell to cover the county’s legal costs. “It is eminently demonstrated that the breadth of the subpoena could not be greater,” Green said in an hour-long hearing at the federal courthouse in Grand Rapids.</p>

Schoeller said he wants to be open and transparent but also doesn&#8217;t want to inadvertently reveal how any individual voted. He said his understanding is that the cast vote records print out in order, so if it was known who the first person was to vote at a specific location then the cast vote records would reveal how that person voted. &#8220;It’s important that we never compromise the secrecy of a ballot,&#8221; Schoeller said. To get clarity on his legal obligations, Schoeller filed a lawsuit in September against Laurie Huddleston — one of the people who requested the voting records. Schoeller&#8217;s lawsuit is assigned to Greene County Judge Jason Brown but will likely transfer to another judge when Brown retires at the end of the year. Roland said he anticipates it taking anywhere from nine months to more than two years to resolve the case.</p>

In a notice of appeal filed November 22 with the Montana Supreme Court, Jacobsen indicated she would challenge Yellowstone County District Judge Michael Moses’ Sept. 30 order finding unconstitutional three laws passed by the GOP-dominated Legislature in 2021: imposing more restrictive voter ID requirements; moving the voter registration deadline back from Election Day to noon the day before; and outlawing paid ballot collection. The notice also appeals the judge&#8217;s previous orders in the case, including one that struck down a law barring anyone who turns 18 before Election Day from getting a ballot before their birthday. Jacobsen is the sole defendant in three separate lawsuits that challenged the four laws. They have been consolidated into a single case, with a dozen plaintiffs including the Democratic Party, Native American organizations and several groups that advocate for young Montanans. The Republican Secretary of State had not previously said definitively whether she’ll take the case to the state’s high court, but has vowed to continue fighting “to make Montana elections the most secure and accessible elections in the nation.”</p>

The one single ballot court fight stemmed from a mail-in vote cast in the November 8th election. The voter is currently registered to vote in Centre County, with the original home address listed as being a Penn State dorm, but the dorm has been closed since august, and in their latest mail-in application, the voter listed two out of county addresses. Ruest ruled against the election board in ordering that the ballot shouldn’t be counted. Meanwhile, the legal status of dozens of other ballots remains unresolved.</p>
<p>Common Pleas Court Judge Harry Smail Jr. ordered<a href="https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/judge-orders-machine-recounts-in-four-westmoreland-voting-precincts/"> machine recounts</a> of election results from four voting precincts, but in doing so rejected requests to review by hand each ballot cast this month in the race for governor and U.S. senator. Voters in five of the county’s 307 voting precincts filed court documents alleging fraud and other misconduct related to the Nov. 8 election. It was part of a statewide effort to challenge the results that saw state Sen. Doug Mastriano and Mehmet Oz, both Republicans, lose their races for governor and U.S. senator, respectively. Smail said state law and a Commonwealth Court ruling from this year prohibited the authorization of hand recounts without evidence of fraud or other potential errors.  Lawsuits asking for recounts were filed by voters in Lower Burrell, Hempfield, Ligonier Borough, Loyalhanna and Salem precincts, each alleging fraud. No evidence of impropriety was produced when they were questioned by the judge during Tuesday’s hearing. Smail refused to allow testimony based on unverified accounts relayed by third parties. The county commissioners, acting as Westmoreland’s election board, on Monday certified results from 302 of the county’s 307 voting precincts.  The county opposed the hand recount requests.</p>

Shortly after the court ruling Tuesday, Harris County commissioners certified the results just in time for the state’s canvassing deadline. The court’s ruling was a win, at least temporarily, for local leaders in a fight against Paxton’s attempt to discard thousands of midterm ballots. Harris County Attorney Christian D. Menefee said the provisional ballots cast after 7 p.m. Election Day should be counted. Those ballots were cast after a district court judge ordered Harris County polling places to remain open an extra hour because many locations had opened late that morning. “The votes that were cast during that time period pursuant to a court order are still perfectly legal. And there’s nothing in the law that prohibits them from being counted,” Menefee said. “So our perspective is that those provisional ballots are no different than any other provisional ballots — they are to be counted.” Harris County officials argued as much in a filing to the Texas Supreme Court on November 22. That came one day after Paxton petitioned the Supreme Court to toss the late-cast ballots.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Charles Eskridge kept the League of Women Voters from attending a<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/immigration/article/LWV-17589591.php"> naturalization ceremony</a> in November. The chief U.S. District Judge of the region, Lee H. Rosenthal, confirmed that for the November ceremony the voting rights group was not present. She and other judges in the Southern District of Texas said they&#8217;ve included the League of Women Voters at previous ceremonies. Eskridge said in an email to the Houston Chronicle that the situation may have been a &#8220;misunderstanding.&#8221; He emphasized that having only been appointed in 2019, months before the COVID-19 outbreak suspended in-person naturalization ceremonies, he was unfamiliar with such a tradition. He said he would &#8220;certainly consider that going forward.&#8221; While judges are not legally obligated to allow the League of Women Voters into naturalization ceremonies, granting their request for participation is considered a formality. The League has had volunteer registrars on hand at such ceremonies for over 20 years, according to Annie Johnson-Benifield, president of the League of Women Voters of Houston.</p>

In the Nov. 8 midterm alone, nearly 27,000 ballots were challenged based on signature comparisons by election workers, according to the secretary of state&#8217;s office. A new lawsuit seeks to ban such signature rejections as unconstitutional, pointing to data suggesting they&#8217;re subjective, error-plagued and disproportionately disenfranchise young people, people with disabilities and people of color. The lawsuit was filed in King County Superior Court by three nonprofit groups that work to boost voter turnout: Vet Voice Foundation, Washington Bus and El Centro de la Raza. Three King County voters whose ballots were rejected because of signature challenges also are plaintiffs. The 39-page complaint names as defendants Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, King County Elections Director Julie Wise and two members of the King County canvassing board. Washington state law requires county elections offices to scrutinize signatures on ballots and verify that they match the signature on file for the voter. The complaint notes documented cases of voter fraud are &#8220;extremely rare&#8221; in Washington and that &#8220;few, if any&#8221; such cases have been caught and prosecuted based on signature matching. &#8220;Therefore, Washington&#8217;s Signature Matching Procedure has disenfranchised tens of thousands of lawful voters for no discernible benefit,&#8221; states the complaint filed by Kevin Hamilton, a Seattle attorney and election law expert who has represented the Democratic Party in election disputes across the country, along with three other attorneys at the law firm Perkins Coie.</p>

The Republican National Committee, along with four non-Green Bay residents, filed the lawsuit Nov. 1 accusing Green Bay city clerk Celestine Jeffreys of violating the law by not allowing people to observe all public aspects of in-person absentee voting at city hall. A judge had a hearing Nov. 2, and ordered the city to make changes for the remaining days of absentee voting before the Nov. 8 election. Although the election is over, the lawsuit continues. In a<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/609560319/Green-Bay-Response-to-Lawsuit"> 10-page response</a> filed November 22, City Clerk Celestine Jeffreys asks for the case to be dismissed, in part referencing the changes made. “Plaintiffs have failed to comply with a mandatory administrative review process and have failed to exhaust administrative remedies,” the reply states. “Some or all of Plaintiffs’ claims are moot, do not present a justiciable controversy, and this Court therefore lacks competency to adjudicate such claims.” No hearings have been scheduled in the case.</p>
<p>Michael Miecielica, 38, the man accused of bringing a<a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/michael-miecielica-knife-west-bend-polling-place/42090071"> knife to a West Bend polling location</a> on Election Day appeared in court this week. Miecielica faces charges for that incident and another that happened days before. Miecielica waived his right to a preliminary hearing for both cases: one where he&#8217;s accused of sending racist and threatening flyers and emails around town and to candidates and the other for bringing a knife to a polling place. No one was physically hurt in either incident. Miecielica is held on a $50,000 cash bond. Miecielica will be arraigned on both cases in January.</p>
