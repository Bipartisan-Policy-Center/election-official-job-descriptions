														<p><strong>Changing the narrative</strong><br />
<em>How elections officials can instill faith in voting equipment</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Long before “The Big Lie,” probably around the time George Washington was on the ballot, some members of the voting public have questioned the integrity of the nation’s voting systems.</p>
<div id="attachment_7613" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7613" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-7613" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MinneapolisED-11.04-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MinneapolisED-11.04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MinneapolisED-11.04.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7613" class="wp-caption-text">(AP Photo/Christian Monterrosa)</p></div>
<p>While that’s nothing new, elections officials are now facing portions of a public — including state-level legislators — who believe, incorrectly, that voting equipment is fundamentally flawed and that nothing short of paper, pencil and an abacus are acceptable for casting and counting ballots.</p>
<p>So what can state and local elections officials do to instill faith in voting systems, especially new equipment? Write themselves back into the narrative.</p>
<p>“Voters are engaged like never before and they are thirsty for information about elections and which practices, procedures and technologies are used to ensure integrity,” said Noah Praetz,, co-founder of<a href="https://electionsgroup.com/"> The Elections Group</a>. “While any particular voting system plays no more than a supporting role in the overall story &#8212; new equipment is a sexy package around which a fresh communication package can be wrapped. Using stakeholders interest allows election officials to inform them about why.”</p>
<p>The implementation of new voting equipment these days tends to include relatively marginal changes from one version of software to the next, or from one type of ballot scanner to another, especially compared to the days following the implementation of the<a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/help-america-vote-act-2002"> Help America Vote Act</a>.</p>
<p>That being said, new equipment comes with significant risks of a relatively higher incidence rate of minor, correctable, innocent errors and misunderstandings that can expose election offices to the damaging information trident.</p>
<p>“First, there is increased risk of misinformation &#8211; incorrect info shared by good faith participants that increases confusion and raises doubt.  Then there is disinformation &#8211; incorrect info shared by bad faith participants done internationally to disrupt, diminish trust and increase confusion,” Praetz said. “Finally, malinformation &#8211; technically correct information about innocent and correctable errors, shared by bad faith participants out of context and proportion in order to damage Americans faith in elections.”</p>
<p>That “information trident” is why <a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> U.S. Election Assistance</a> Commissioner Donald Palmer [Editor&#8217;s Note, Palmer was chair of the EAC at the time of this interview, but his term chair ended today] agreed that it’s really about telling the story about how voting equipment gets to voters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2943" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/voting-booth-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />“I really think it’s about telling the story about how a machine actually ends up being offered,” Palmer said, adding that he would love someday if the EAC could make a really informative 2-5 minute video educating the public about the process, which is a system of checks and balances long before a voter casts a ballot.</p>
<p>Palmer said it’s important for elections officials to make the voting public understand that equipment isn’t purchased in a vacuum, that there are multiple layers of bureaucracy, on both sides of the aisle, that equipment must go through.</p>
<p>“Let’s accept the fact that we’re a divided country. We all have failings, but it’s hard to believe it would go through such a decentralized process and that there is a big conspiracy — it’s hard to believe there is no level a problem wouldn’t have been caught and we have to argue that,” Palmer said. “There is a level of integrigy and we have to tell that story. That has to be part of this.”</p>
<p>No matter the circumstances of voting equipment change, a new deployment provides a tremendous opportunity for election officials to re-engage all of their stakeholders, and to reset relationships with some voters that may be frayed given the current flood of confusing and outright false information.</p>
<p>“Election officials have made incredible progress since 2016 to harden their security posture, including by replacing aging and paperless voting equipment,” said Geoff Hale, director of the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/election-security"> Election Security Initiative at CISA</a>. “Through pre-election logic and accuracy tests, robust chain-of-custody and ballot accounting procedures, and post-election tabulation audits, election officials can ensure and demonstrate to others that their voting equipment is functioning as intended. CISA works with election officials to implement secure practices and to publicly communicate about those practices. An informed public is our best defense against mis-, dis-, and malinformation.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3338" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ELEC_Vot-Here-copy-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ELEC_Vot-Here-copy-201x300.jpg 201w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ELEC_Vot-Here-copy-768x1147.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ELEC_Vot-Here-copy-685x1024.jpg 685w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px" />Before joining the<a href="https://elect.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx"> Kentucky State Board of Elections</a>, Richard House was the clerk for<a href="https://www.daviessky.org/daviess-county-clerks-office/"> Daviess County</a> and went through the process of purchasing new machines right before making the move.</p>
<p>“Be as open and transparent as you can,” House advised. He said opening up the selection process to as many people as possible is key, although he did note that in 26 years of working in the clerk’s office, very few members of the public have taken him up on the offer, still he said it’s important to make sure they know about the process and can participate on some level.</p>
<p>Of the most recent purchase of voting equipment in Daviess County, House did note that the commissioner’s court—the folks footing the bill—had way more questions about the systems than they had in the past. Whether that’s because of the current environment or because the county was spending their own money, as opposed to federal funding, House wasn’t sure, but he did note that all the commissioners came to the demonstration of the equipment, something that has never really happened before.</p>
<p>“New equipment will absolutely come with more errors, more misunderstanding,” Praetz said, adding that it’s important for election officials to get ahead of stores that may come out and brace their stakeholders for types of small errors that may occur.</p>
<p>“This will help election workers recognize their part and also react quickly to unexpected occurrence, it will help candidates and campaigns calibrate their reactions to incidents, and most importantly it will help the public understand that some of this is to be expected with massive new technology rollouts,” Praetz said.</p>
<p>Here are some additional recommendations for election officials implementing new voting systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hire or appoint a project manager working for the election officials and not the vendor, to keep the project on track, and insulate staff who have to do all of their regular work to keep elections running.</li>
<li>Increase the training requirements on election workers and pay them for their extra time.  Muscle memory will be their most potent weapon.</li>
<li>Rebuild the training materials and operating documentation that election officials rely upon -ensure the materials are usable &#8211; using design techniques suggested by Center for Civic Design, for example.</li>
<li>Make materials available in numerous formats including paper, online, and video.</li>
<li>Invest significant resources towards engaging all stakeholder groups, particularly election workers, candidates &amp; campaigns, and of course voters.</li>
<li>Build incident response plans with communications prepackaged to reduce response time.</li>
<li>Review and update all chain of custody procedures to track assets both inside your facilities and when in use; and</li>
<li>Develop written standard operating procedures for staff &#8211; similar to those provided to election workers in training manuals and operating checklists.</li>
</ul>

This week,<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/02/22/election-2022-complete-ohio-primary-not-possible-may-3-without-maps/6899901001/"> Ohio</a> Secretary of State Frank LaRose said he did not see how it would be possible to have a congressional primary on May 3. &#8220;I can foresee almost no circumstance where it is possible to conduct the district races on May 3rd,&#8221; LaRose told reporters. In a letter to legislative leaders, LaRose said: “Let me be clear on this point: it is impossible to see a scenario in which these maps are favorably passed by the Redistricting Commission, challenged by litigants, reviewed by the court and given final approval within a time frame conducive to a May 3, 2022 primary election date.” That leaves Ohio with two likely options: Delay the entire primary or<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/02/09/ohio-redistricting-proposal-2-primaries-could-cost-millions/6725422001/"> hold two primaries</a> – one for statewide elections, such as governor and U.S. Senate, and another for the congressional, statehouse, state board of education and political party governing body races. While officials in Pennsylvania have two more weeks to prepare than their counterparts in Ohio, the clock is still ticking loudly and officials in<a href="https://www.dailyitem.com/news/election-leader-we-just-want-an-answer/article_b606db22-9017-11ec-94c3-d72ad0c4524d.html"> Pennsylvania</a> have the added pressure of awaiting court rulings on the state’s vote by mail law. “We just want an answer,” said Nathan Savidge, the chief registrar of the Northumberland County Board of Elections. “We can provide information but the candidates can’t circulate petitions. Without district lines, we can’t begin the process of coding (drafting) the ballot. We can’t do any testing, we don’t know which offices go in which district, which candidates go in which office, and those candidates can’t circulate petitions.” “We are continuing to prepare but there’s a lot of work that is stopped right now until some decisions are made,”<a href="https://local21news.com/news/local/counties-are-on-hold-preparing-for-elections-awaiting-state-decisions"> said</a> York County President Commissioner Julie Wheeler. In <strong>Texas</strong>, where early voting is winding down in advance of the March 1 primary, there were several issues. According to reports, <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/2022/02/23/419703/despite-hotly-contested-primaries-few-texans-have-voted-early-so-far/">turnout for early voting</a> is very low, voters continue to experience problems with <a href="https://abc13.com/election-day-voting-harris-county-vote-mail-in-ballot/11593842/">mail ballots</a> and <a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/political/severe-weather-impacts-some-polling-places-early-voting-ends-friday">winter weather</a> forced a number of early voting polling places in parts of the state to close early or shutter entirely.</p>

According to Cal Matters, Weber’s office blames limited information from the Census Bureau for the move, but did not say if it will act on the advocacy groups’ demands. “We were disappointed that the data we received from the Census Bureau did not include the level of detail we previously received in 2017,” Joe Kocurek, Weber’s press secretary, said in a statement. “We are currently exploring options to ensure that voters have the tools they need to effectively vote.” Advocates sent a letter to Weber calling on her office to act urgently to give the state’s counties time to prepare for the June primary. “The reduction of covered languages similarly creates new obstacles for limited-English proficient voters,” the letter states. “With so much at stake, California cannot backslide. We must continue to lead and take bold steps to protect voting rights and remove barriers to the ballot box for all eligible voters, including voters who are members of language minority groups.”</p>

First, congratulations to<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/reuters-wins-polk-award-series-intimidation-us-election-workers-2022-02-21/"> Reuters for receiving a George Polk Award</a> for its coverage of widespread intimidation of U.S. election workers. Polk Awards, presented by Long Island University in the United States, honor special achievement in journalism, with particular focus on investigative reporting in the public interest. Second, The Washington Post announced this week the creation of a<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/2022/02/22/post-expands-coverage-american-democracy-with-new-democracy-team/"> Democracy Desk</a>. The new Democracy Team will include three newly created reporting positions based in Georgia, Arizona and the Upper Midwest that will cover how local and state officials navigate the politicization of the election process, while also tracking legislative and legal battles over voting rules and access to the polls. These reporters will work closely with other members of the team, which will include Post reporters who have played a leading role in this coverage area. Along those lines, 1A, a syndicated program from NPR affiliate WAMU, has announced the launch of<a href="https://mail.yahoo.com/d/folders/1/messages/ABFuPJApSb2MYhUY7AFXwNyzYbA"> 1A Remaking America</a>, a major, two-year collaborative reporting project covering the threats to America’s democracy. Funded by a grant from The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), 1A Remaking America aims to examine and better understand the forces behind a growing distrust in institutions, and what’s dividing communities and families and eroding our confidence as a nation.</p>

The Ronald Reagan Award Program will recognize Kentucky businesses that encourage employees to serve as poll workers. “President Reagan said, ‘Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.’ The same is true of democracy,” Adams said. “We can’t have an election without election workers. Government can’t solve all our problems, so I’m asking the private sector to help us open the polls.” To qualify for the award, nominees must be a Kentucky business in good standing and promote poll worker recruitment by offering paid time off to volunteer as a poll worker, or other incentives such as bonuses or additional days off.   Businesses of various sizes will be honored: small businesses (1-25 employees), medium-sized businesses (26-100 employees) and large businesses (100+ employees). Businesses can<a href="https://sos.ky.gov/sos-office/Pages/Ronald-Reagan-Award.aspx"> nominate</a> themselves or be nominated by others.</p>

On Thursday, the senate committee advanced seven of those 100, including Borrelli&#8217;s bill. The team would be created under the auditor general&#8217;s office, which currently does not field an elections audit team. The auditor general, who was present, was called to speak on the bill.</p>
<p>Early voters in Arizona would be barred from putting their ballots in mailboxes and would instead be required to put them in<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/02/21/theres-no-such-thing-as-smart-ballot-drop-boxes-a-gop-proposal-would-require-their-use/"> ballot drop boxes</a> that would take a picture of every voter if under a Republican proposal that won preliminary approval last week.  Under the legislation, drop boxes would be outfitted with 24-hour photo or video cameras that can link any ballots inserted into the box to that person’s image. Each person would be allowed to deposit no more than seven ballots into a drop box, and the boxes would be required to generate a receipt showing how many ballots a person deposited. (It would also have to keep an internal copy of every receipt). And if the camera malfunctions, the box must be designed to prevent ballots from being deposited. “If we can’t get an outright ban (on drop-boxes) we need to come up with these ‘smart’ drop boxes. In the meantime — while we’re working on those — I would like to see drop-boxes in a secure location,” said Sen. Kelly Townsend, a Republican from Apache Junction and the sponsor of<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/77553?=Session525"> Senate Bill 1571</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4166" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />California:</strong> Sen. Josh Newman (D), introduced a bill that would<a href="https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2022/02/18/california-joins-handful-of-states-seeking-stronger-laws-to-protect-election-workers/"> give election workers the option of keeping their home addresses private</a>. The measure is aimed at reducing harassment by preventing the public release of personal information online or on social media platforms. The bill would allow election workers to enroll in California’s existing privacy protection programs that are available to survivors of domestic violence, judges and politicians, among others. “Once your personal information is on the internet, there’s no shortage of people that may act on that information, especially when triggered,” said Newman. “It’s got to be terrifying.”</p>
<p>East Bay Sen. Steve Glazer who chairs the Senate committee on elections  says state lawmakers are looking at<a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/lawmakers-look-to-reform-california-recall-process/"> several reforms for the state’s recall process</a>, among them requiring more signatures to have a recall. Another reform legislators are looking at is not having a second ballot of candidates to replace the person being recalled. According to KRON, look for some recall reform proposal to come out of the statehouse within the next four weeks. But anything the legislature approves, must also be approved by voters.</p>

As written, the bill would require that the D.C. Board of Elections create a secure system to allow any voter to fill out and submit a ballot from their smartphone, tablet, or computer. After being submitted, the elections board would print and count the ballots. The system would also check that a voter is actually eligible to cast a ballot, and authorize regular security audits. It remains to be seen if the council will get to the bill before the end of the current session at the end of the year, after which any measures not passed into law have to be reintroduced. Lawmakers are already working their way through a number of bills that would make changes to the city’s voting system. Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), who chairs the committee that oversees the elections board and would decide whether or not to move it forward, did not sign on to Pinto’s bill.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3751" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Florida-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Florida:</strong> An<a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/499574-amendment-striking-id-number-requirement-adding-fines-for-fraudulent-party-registration-filed-for-senate-elections-bill/"> amendment filed</a> for the Senate’s main elections bill would strike language requiring identification numbers on vote-by-mail ballots and add fines for those that fraudulently change someone’s party affiliation.<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022/524"> SB 524</a> would create a new office in the Department of State to investigate election fraud, increase penalties for election and voting-related offenses, change the vote-by-mail process and ban ranked choice voting. Sen. Travis Hutson, the bill’s sponsor, filed an amendment that would remove from the bill a section requiring the last four digits of a voter’s social security number, driver’s license or photo ID on vote-by-mail ballots. The amendment also adds a fine to organizations if a person collecting voter applications on its behalf changes someone’s party affiliation without consent. The fine is $1,000 per altered application. Hutson said the changes were largely driven by feedback from legislators during the bill’s time in the Senate Ethics and Elections committee. Several Democratic lawmakers voiced concerns that including the last four digits of a voter’s social security number in a document containing their signature could be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5199" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GACapitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Georgia:</strong> Members of the Georgia General Assembly have introduced legislation that would allow the use of instant runoff, or<a href="https://thefulcrum.us/instant-runoff-voting"> ranked-choice</a>, for local elections, potentially creating significant savings in a state that often has to hold an additional round of voting after Election Day. Versions of the legislation have been introduced in both chambers, and with both Republican and Democratic sponsors. While these bills would only impact municipal elections, successful implementation could lead to changes for federal and state elections. Last year, Georgia approved ranked-choice voting for military and overseas voters. Currently Georgia holds runoff elections when no candidate in a race earns a majority of the vote.</p>

<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5969" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IDCap-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IDCap-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IDCap-768x576.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IDCap.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Idaho:</strong> The House narrowly passed a bill that<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/02/21/idaho-house-narrowly-passes-bill-to-change-unaffiliated-voter-deadline/"> changes the deadline for unaffiliated voters</a> in Idaho, a law that would take effect immediately if it is passed by the Senate and signed into law by Gov. Brad Little.<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2022/legislation/H0439/"> House Bill 439</a> passed the House by a vote of 36-32, with 20 Republicans joining all 12 Democrats voting against it. Under existing Idaho law, voters in the state’s four recognized political parties — Republican, Democrat, Constitution and Libertarian — who want to change their party affiliation or become unaffiliated can do so by filing a request with the respective county clerk office by the candidate filing deadline before a primary election. Those who are already designated as unaffiliated voters can change their affiliation status to any of the four party categories any time, up to and including the day of the primary election. If the bill is signed into law, unaffiliated voters would be required to affiliate with a political party by the last date a candidate can declare for a partisan office before a primary election, which is March 11 in this election year.</p>
<p>The House also approved a bill making it<a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-idaho-boise-8707847d261e58b2ae96183b72fca865"> illegal to deliver a neighbor’s voting ballot</a> to the post office. The bill, from Rep. Mike Moyle, a Republican from Star, aims to prevent so-called ballot harvesting by making it a crime for someone to convey another person’s mail-in ballot unless they are a household member. Delivering 10 or more ballots to the post office on behalf of other people would be a felony under the bill; delivering fewer would be a misdemeanor.  The bill “tries to make it clear that we don’t like cheaters,” Moyle told his fellow lawmakers on the House floor. The bill passed 53-15 and now goes to the Senate.</p>
<p>A bill to allow county clerks or the Secretary of State’s Office to<a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2022/02/18/bill-allowing-close-election-appeal-advances/"> appeal a close election</a> advanced to the House floor. The bill has been called the elections replay bill and would grant an appeal in the event of a election that is too close to call. The decision over whether or not a new election would be needed would then go to the District Court.</p>
<p>A bill has been introduced to the House State Affairs Committee that would allow<a href="https://www.kmvt.com/2022/02/22/bill-allowing-list-who-died-become-public-record-introduced/"> a list of who has died</a> to become a non-exempt public record. This would allow the public to view and validate voter registration information. Currently, this information is kept by the Department of Health and Welfare and the Secretary of State. Bill sponsor Priscilla Giddings cited an instance of a deceased voter in Latah County still on the voter roll as justification for this bill.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-5802" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IN-Capitol-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Indiana:</strong> The Republican-controlled House voted 70-25 for<a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2022/bills/senate/328"> Senate Bill 328</a> to<a href="https://www.pdclarion.com/news/state/hoosier-lawmakers-agree-to-make-double-voting-in-same-election-a-felony/article_86566adc-a95f-54ea-8990-6aa1d88c6b7c.html"> close a loophole</a> that could allow a double voter to potentially avoid a criminal penalty for casting a ballot twice in the same election and make other election law changes. Specifically, it would be a level 6 felony, punishable by up to two-and-a-half years behind bars, for a person to knowingly or intentionally vote more than one ballot in the same election, unless the voter is casting a replacement ballot due to a candidate&#8217;s death or another authorized reason. The legislation now goes back to the Republican-controlled Senate for a decision on advancing it to Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb to be signed into law.</p>

<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3569" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IowaStateHouse-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IowaStateHouse-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IowaStateHouse-768x576.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IowaStateHouse.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Iowa:</strong> or the second year in a row, Iowa Republicans have their sights set on big changes for Iowa&#8217;s voting and election security systems. Identical companion bills are advancing in both chambers that would<a href="https://www.kwwl.com/news/bills-to-change-recount-process-and-absentee-voting-advance-in-both-chambers/article_30e580de-907a-11ec-ae8d-3319625012e7.html"> change how recounts are done</a>, how people vote absentee and also prevent election commissioners from accepting private donations. Currently in Iowa, a candidate requesting a recount can ask for specific precincts to be looked at, and can also request a hand or machine recount. Under the proposed SSB 3143 and HSB 719, candidates asking for a recount in one precinct would have to request a recount for the entire voting area; whether that be a city, county, or entire congressional district. The bills also require that a candidate chose hand recount or machine recount throughout the entire process. This was a point of contention in the high-profile IA-02 recount between Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Democrat Rita Hart. The proposed legislation would also make recount boards larger throughout Iowa. It proposes a system where counties with 15,000 or less people have a three-person recount board, counties between 15,000 and 50,000 have five people, and counties larger than 50,000 have a board of seven people. Also as part of these new companion bills is another security measure to absentee ballots. In addition to people putting either their driver&#8217;s license number or voter ID number on the absentee ballot request form, they&#8217;ll also have to put it on the inner envelope when they send the official ballot back.</p>

<p><a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0532?ys=2022RS">Senate Bill 532</a>, introduced by Sen. Justin D. Ready (R-Carroll), would require voters to show some form of identification before casting a ballot. Similar to a bill Ready filed last year, the legislation would allow voters to use a government-issued photo ID, bank statement, utility bill, government check, paycheck or “any other government document that shows the voter’s name and address and is dated within three months before the election,” according to the bill.</p>
<p><a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/sb0738?ys=2022RS">Senate Bill 738</a>, introduced by Simonaire, would require the State Board of Elections to conduct a full audit of mail-in ballots if a sample audit of ballots showed that a threshold number of signatures on ballot envelopes did not match voters’ recorded signatures.</p>
<p><a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb0963?ys=2022RS">House Bill 963</a>, introduced by Del. Haven N. Shoemaker Jr. (R-Carroll), would require election officials to verify signatures on all mail-in ballots. That bill would require local election boards to compare signatures on mail-in ballot envelopes with those in voter registration records and would allow them to use machines to electronically verify signatures. The bill would require election boards throw out mail-in ballots where signatures can’t be verified but would allow voters to fill out a form to verify their signatures within two days of receiving the board’s notice that their ballot has been rejected.</p>
<p><a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb0939?ys=2022RS">House Bill 939</a>, also from Shoemaker, would prohibit sending mail-in ballots to voters unless the voters requested them. Ballots were mailed to all registered primary voters in Maryland during the 2020 primary election, but for the general election, request forms were mailed and voters had to return them to get a mail-in ballot.</p>
<p>And<a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb1172?ys=2022RS"> House Bill 1172</a>, introduced by Del. William J. Wivell (R-Washington), would remove party affiliation from mail-in ballot envelopes — similar to<a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb0746?ys=2021RS"> a bill</a> that received bipartisan support last year and passed the House of Delegates, but didn’t advance in the state Senate.</p>

The Senate Elections Committee approved House Bills 4132 and 4133. The bills would allow felony charges for voter fraud using absentee ballots or ballot applications. Felony charges spelled out in House Bill 4132 include: Filling out and submitting an absentee ballot application in someone else&#8217;s name for reasons other than exceptions allowed under current law; Requesting multiple absentee ballots for the same election; and Providing false information or forging the signature on an absentee ballot application. House Bill 4133 would make each of those three charges a felony punishable by up to five years in prison with a $1,000 fine. The new bills have to pass the full Senate and Michigan House before they go to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who will decide whether to sign them into law.</p>
<p>A Republican-led committee returned<a href="https://www.michiganradio.org/politics-government/2022-02-23/gop-led-panel-asks-michigan-secretary-of-state-to-submit-new-voting-rules"> proposed voting regulations</a> to Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office and asked her agency to re-submit new rules. Republicans on the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules focused largely on absentee ballots and signature verification. “This sort of stuff causes people to lose confidence in elections, and so I’m hopeful the secretary will take our recommendations today, look through these rules and make these changes so we can strengthen people’s confidence in elections,” said Republican Representative Matt Hall, a co-chair of the joint House and Senate committee. Democrats opposed the Republican amendments, arguing they will make it more likely that absentee ballots will be rejected and voters will be disenfranchised. Benson has 30 days to respond to the request. A spokesperson for the Secretary of State says the Republicans’ proposed changes are being reviewed.</p>

Currently, around 26,000 Minnesotans are signed up for the permanent absentee ballot list, but they are sent an application prior to each election in order to receive their absentee ballot. The bill would forego the application process to make early, absentee voting more accessible. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Liz Boldon (DFL-Rochester), has no Senate companion. The bill would require that absentee ballots be mailed at least 46 days before each regularly scheduled primary or general election for federal, state, county, city or school board office; at least 46 days before each special primary or special election to fill a federal, state, county, city or school board vacancy; and at least 30 days before a town general election held in March. The bill would also expand the early voting timeline from seven days to 30 days.</p>

Voters’ initial political party affiliation would be based on their ballot choice during the 2024 presidential primary or the August 2024 primary. The bill would also note Missourians’ political party affiliation on voter identification cards.</p>

All 20 measures in Herman’s resolution, dated Feb. 16, came from suggestions made during 4½ hours of public comment at a recent county commission meeting. Among Herman&#8217;s proposed “measures to ensure accuracy, security, and purity of elections,&#8221; according to the resolution: Utiliz(e) stealth paper ballots as primary method of voting, with provision of one electronic voting kiosk for ADA qualified voters; Ensure mail ballots are sent certified receipt so only intended voter takes possession of it; Ensure there is a Nevada National Guard presence at each polling/ballot box location, as well as the central counting center; and Ensure ballots are counted by hand in order to be counted by hand in a recount.

The two versions of the legislation do the same thing, changing the word domicile to primary residence, and stipulating that only citizens of the country and state have the right to vote. But voting rights organizations like America Votes and the League of Women Voters say citizenship of New Hampshire is unclear and impossible to prove.  The Senate’s version of the legislation –<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/pdf.aspx?id=31729&amp;q=amendment"> CACR 36</a> – will be up for a vote this week, having secured the support of the majority of the committee, who recommend the legislation move forward in a 3-2 vote, which indicates it could have a good shot of passing the Senate floor. At a Senate hearing, 133 people signed in support of the bill and 154 in opposition. The House proposal came in the form of a non-germane amendment to<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/pdf.aspx?id=26251&amp;q=billVersion"> CACR 15</a> – the underlying legislation would give 17-year-olds the right to vote in a primary election provided they would turn 18 by the time of the general election.</p>

It also had provisions to give convicted felons the right to vote when they are released and streamlined voting procedures and registration. Republicans adamantly opposed the bills throughout the session but Democrats say they intend to still push ahead. “We’re ready to vote on this bill. New Mexicans are being denied expanded voting rights and increased election security.

<p>A Republican-led proposal asking voters to add a voter-ID requirement to the state constitution is moving forward. The Senate Committee on Rules advanced it to the Senate floor on a 13-0 vote.</p>
<p>Another bill similarly seeking to shield the state from changes to federal election laws passed a House committee last week. House Bill 3232 states that if the federal government makes laws that go against Oklahoma election law, those laws would be followed only during separately held federal elections. The proposal, which would cost at least $1 million to $1.5 million per election, passed on a 5-2 party-line vote with Democrats in opposition.</p>
<p>Two bills failed to make it out of committee  Democrats saw one of their legislative priorities take a hit when a House committee refused to advance a proposal to make it easier and quicker to restore voting rights to ex-felons. The proposal from Rep. Regina Goodwin, D-Tulsa, would have clarified when an individual convicted of a felony will be eligible to register to vote. She said it is needed because there has been “some controversy” on when ex-felons, who had a commuted or discharged sentence, can register. After some discussion, the House Elections and Ethics Committee rejected it on a 4-3 vote.</p>
<p>Another Democratic-led proposal didn’t advance out of the committee. A bill from Rep. Merleyn Bell, D-Norman, would required all state institutions of higher education to make at least one full-time staff member available to notarize ballots during designated absentee voting periods. Though it didn’t carry a cost, it failed to advance after no other lawmaker agreed to “second” a motion to bring it to a vote.</p>

The board, in an effort that’s believed to be the first of its kind in the state, will declare “that we believe that we must ensure that all students have access to an education that teaches and promotes the importance of civic engagement and voter registration” in a resolution widely expected to pass Thursday night. School districts are already designated voter registration agencies per state and federal law, and a voter education curriculum already exists in the city, but the resolution cements and moves to the forefront year-round efforts to both allow for eligible students to sign up to vote, and for them to understand why it matters. The district will continue to designate and pay a staffer at each high school as “Voter Champion,” the point person for providing voter registration materials to students as they become eligible. There will be an emphasis on a nonpartisan voter education and registration curriculum for 12th grade civics classes, and voter engagement assemblies for high school students.</p>

Republican Rep. Taffy Howard’s bill would require a “forensic audit” of ballots, voting equipment, and voter verification processes to verify federal office results if two presidential candidates come within 10 percentage points of each other. House Democrat Leader Rep. Jamie Smith pointed out that his caucus was reduced to just eight seats after the election, and yet he had no reason to blame fraud or irregularities. “This is partisanship,” he said. “This is not good policy for the state of South Dakota.” Other Republicans avoided alleging fraud outright, but argued that checking up on election results was a good safeguard. The bill does not stipulate how audits would be funded, but allows the State Board of Elections to contract with outside organizations “with experience in forensic audits.” The bill will next be considered in the Senate.</p>
<p>A bill that has met with approval from the House of state Representatives would give cities and school districts<a href="https://www.aberdeennews.com/story/news/local/2022/02/21/bill-seeks-move-city-school-elections-primary-general/6805554001/"> two options for an election date</a> &#8212; the June primary or the November general election. House Bill 1300 has been approved by the House State Affairs committee (10-1) and by the full House (47-19). It now goes before the Senate Local Government Committee with its first hearing on Wednesday. The bill was proposed by District 24 Rep. Will Mortenson, R-Pierre, who said the intent of the measure, which would go into effect in 2025, is to provide broader awareness of city and school candidate elections.</p>

Phil Lyman (R-Blanding), was defeated in a 3 to 7 vote after a lengthy hearing in the House Government Operations Committee. The bill was strongly opposed by Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson and county clerks who said it would restrict access to the ballot. The bill sought to return the state to primarily in-person voting. It also would have scrapped ballot drop-off boxes and drive-through voting, while requiring an independent audit of certain races after they’re over. Some limited absentee voting would have been allowed. Lyman told the House committee he didn’t have an issue with county clerks but asserted there is a “crisis of confidence” in voting. Ryan Cowley, Utah elections director, testified there are already measures in place to audit the security and reliability of elections. He also said that power should remain with the lieutenant governor, who is an elected official. Ricky Hatch, Weber County clerk/auditor who spoke on behalf of the Utah Association of Counties, added that any problems with elections are minor and are quickly addressed once they’re identified.</p>

The Senate voted 28-2 on<a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2022/S.265"> S.265</a>’s second reading. The bill would increase criminal penalties for those who threaten violence in certain settings, such as schools, government buildings and places of worship. It also would limit a legal defense against criminal threatening charges. Sen. Dick Sears, D-Bennington, told his colleagues on the floor that the genesis of the bill was a response to repeated threats to elections officials in Vermont following the 2020 general election as well as health officials during the coronavirus pandemic — threats that he called “profane,” “ugly” and “to (his) mind, threatening.” One argument against S.265 is that it could infringe on First Amendment rights to free speech. While the bill was in committee, the ACLU of Vermont warned lawmakers that an earlier version of S.265 could be applied too broadly and chill “certain forms of political hyperbole.” The bill has since been amended, but the ACLU still does not support the bill, calling it unnecessary. The bill also removes the state’s affirmative defense for those accused of criminal threatening, who say they could not or did not intend to carry out their threat. Sears said a defendant could still make that case to a court, but it would not be an affirmative defense as it is currently.</p>

In a meeting, the nine Democrats on the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee repeatedly overruled six Republicans to kill the first batch of GOP-sponsored voting bills coming over from the House of Delegates. In addition to blocking several photo ID bills, the committee defeated efforts to cut the early voting window from 45 days to 14 days, repeal the same-day voter registration system set to be implemented this year and ban absentee drop boxes. As a result of those votes, all bills to bring back photo ID, a policy priority for Gov. Glenn Youngkin, are dead for the year. Though most Virginia voters still show a photo ID before casting their ballot, Democrats changed the law in 2020 to allow voters without ID to sign a form affirming their identity.</p>

If passed, the bill would require voters to declare or change their party affiliation changes by May 12, the day the candidate filing period begins. The second bill,<a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2022/SF0096"> Senate File No. 96</a>, would prohibit what Biteman called “ballot harvesting,” or individuals and groups gathering or submitting completed absentee ballots from other voters without written and official authorization by the voters. If the bill is passed, unauthorized collection and submission of ballots could be a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison, a $10,000 fine or both.

The Supreme Court this week consolidated two lawsuits challenging the map and granted an hour for oral arguments. The case will be heard in the court’s next term, which begins in October. That means the challenged map will be in place for the 2022 mid-term elections in Alabama. A three-judge district court panel ruled in January that the congressional district map approved by the Alabama Legislature and signed by Gov. Kay Ivey in November 2021, violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The Act, in part, bars a political process that gives less opportunity to Black voters to elect representatives of their choice. The district court found that Alabama’s current map – which is similar to the map for the previous 10 years -dilutes the Black vote with the establishment of six majority-White districts and one majority-Black district. The court called for the map to be redrawn to include two Black majority or near-majority districts.  The court ordered a stay in the congressional race until a new, approved map was drawn. Alabama challenged the ruling and filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Supreme Court. Alabama argued the court was wrong in its reading of the law and the remedy suggested and it said attempting to redraw the map in an election year would cause chaos. The Alabama primary election is May 24, the absentee ballot deadline is March 30.</p>
<p>The Greater Birmingham Ministries sued Secretary of State John Merrill over a<a href="https://www.alreporter.com/2022/02/23/greater-birmingham-ministries-sues-alabama-secretary-of-state-over-records-request/"> records request</a> seeking purged voter lists and those denied the right to vote because of felony convictions.  The civil<a href="https://campaignlegal.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/1-main.pdf"> lawsuit</a> filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama by the Campaign Legal Center on behalf of Greater Birmingham Ministries asks the court to declare that Merrill is in violation of the National Voter Registration Act and to order him to provide those records without cost related to photocopying. The lawsuit alleges Merrill declined the group’s May 17, 2021, records request seeking “a list of every voter removed from the active voter rolls after the 2020 election and their contact information for every county in Alabama.”  The Greater Birmingham Ministries, which helps with voters registration and restoration of voting rights, says it needs the lists of those denied voter registration or those purged from voter rolls to identify and correct the the matter for those who can legally vote but who may be unaware.  The lawsuit states that Merrill said those records could be reviewed in person, but that it would cost the group $1,331.40 to get those records, or 1 cent per name for the 133,140 names. The suit alleges that in subsequent communications Merrill admitted those records were kept electronically, and that the National Voter Registration Act allows states to charge for such records.</p>

Justices rejected arguments by attorneys for Secretary of State John Thurston that he was immune from the lawsuit filed by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas, Arkansas United and five voters over the restrictions. The court upheld a Pulaski County judge’s decision to reject Thurston’s request for a dismissal. The measures being challenged include a change to the state’s voter ID law that removes the option for someone to sign an affidavit affirming their identity if they don’t present a photo ID at the polls. The groups are also challenging a law preventing anyone other than voters from being within 100 feet of a polling place, one requiring an absentee voter’s signature on a ballot to match the signature on their voter registration application, and another moving up the deadline for voters to return absentee ballots in person.</p>
<p>A coalition that includes the NAACP, the Arkansas Public Policy Panel and the American Civil Liberties Union will take their fight against a<a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2022/02/23/voting-rights-advocates-appeal-decision-on-arkansas-state-house-map-that-shorts-black-voters"> state legislative map</a> to the next level. They filed an appeal Wednesday in response to a U.S. district judge’s opinion that said while there is evidence to suggest Arkansas’s newly redrawn map of state House districts violates the Voting Rights Act, voters don’t have standing to sue. Only the U.S. attorney general can bring a suit over Voting Rights Act violations, Judge Lee Rudofsky said. “We had no choice but to appeal that,” Arkansas Public Policy Panel Policy Director Kymara Seals said. “This decision that the judge has made is unprecedented. No court has ever, ever, ever, in the history of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, said that we, as private citizens, can’t fight for our rights and protections.”</p>

Griswold’s office filed the lawsuit after Schroeder failed to fully answer questions posed in orders issued on Jan. 19 and Jan. 24 about the hard drive images copies, which came to light in an affidavit Schroeder signed on Jan. 7 as part of a lawsuit, which claimed the election software used by Colorado counties in 2020 was not properly certified. The lawsuit compels Schroeder to comply with the previous orders and answer questions about the locations of the hard drive copies and who has access to them.</p>
<p>Scott Gessler, the attorney for Clerk Tina Peters, has filed a<a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/gessler-files-motion-to-dismiss-peters-case/article_d5c00b14-94e0-11ec-bdd9-6fc20ea877c6.html"> motion to dismiss</a> a case against her that seeks to remove her permanently as Mesa County’s designated election official. The lawsuit, filed by Secretary of State Jena Griswold and county voter Heidi Hess, also calls for removing Deputy Clerk Belinda Knisley and Peters’ second deputy, Julie Fisher, also to be barred from overseeing elections for the rest of this year, when the clerk’s term ends. Gessler’s motion to dismiss is similar to his arguments in the last lawsuit that barred Peters from overseeing the 2021 fall election, which District Judge Valerie Robison rejected.</p>

Budzik ordered a primary held on March 15. Attorney Alexander Taubes, representing the plaintiffs, said the order followed a settlement agreement between plaintiffs and defendants. Plaintiffs in the suit against Democratic registrar Troy Mitchell represented 17 Democrats, who, along with supporting volunteers, collected 578 signatures on nominating petitions, according to documents filed with the lawsuit in Hartford Superior Court. The plaintiffs asked the court to order Mitchell to accept the petition signatures and order the town to hold a primary for Democratic Town Committee on the second Tuesday in March, one week later than the date set by law due to the delay caused by Mitchell’s allegedly illegal actions, according to the suit.</p>

Walker will weigh more than 1,600 exhibits, tens of thousands of pages of documents and testimony by dozens of witnesses in combined lawsuits that challenged a 2021 law imposing new restrictions on mail-in voting and third-party voter registration organizations. The 2021 legislation (SB 90) included restricting election supervisors’ use of drop boxes; requiring voters to request mail-in ballots more frequently, and forcing third-party groups to provide a disclaimer informing potential voters that their applications may not be turned in within a 14-day window imposed by the law. The League of Women Voters of Florida and a number of Black and Hispanic advocacy groups filed lawsuits challenging the measure, alleging that it was the state’s latest effort to restrict minority voters from accessing the ballot. Walker began a trial Jan. 31</p>

The decision paves the way for candidate filing to resume Thursday after a long delay. GOP leaders and voting rights groups—tied up for months in a legal battle over the maps—filed emergency appeals Wednesday, shortly after a panel of lower-court judges approved congressional and state legislative districts.  The trial court, which included two Republicans and one Democrat, signed off on redrawn state House and Senate boundaries that state lawmakers approved last week, but the court went with a congressional map of its own, crafted with the help of independent redistricting experts it hired known as &#8220;special masters.&#8221;</p>

Instead, they argue that Pennsylvania’s soon-to-be 17 congressional representatives should run in a statewide free-for-all, following an obscure 1941 federal law. The lawsuit, first reported by the Associated Press, was filed on Feb. 11 by five Pennsylvania voters including Republican congressional candidates Jim Bognet and Aaron Bashir, as well as Susquehanna County Commissioner Alan Hall, who also serves on that county’s board of elections. This week, the plaintiffs asked for an injunction preventing the state Supreme Court from acting further. The court heard arguments in its map case last Friday. “The state judiciary has no authority to alter or ‘suspend’ the primary-election calendar that the Legislature has enacted, and it is constitutionally prohibited from doing so,” the suit argues.</p>

The decision to reinstate this portion of the voting law means elections officials can now be prosecuted if they help citizens vote.</p>

Nine ballot boxes across the county will have barcode scanners installed on the outside that voters can use to scan their ballot when it&#8217;s dropped off, the agency said. Upon scanning their ballot, voters will receive a text message confirming it was dropped off and will then be able to track it through the ballot counting process, the Registrar of Voters said in a statement. The agency said the ballot tracking program is similar to how the medical industry tracks tissue samples and that it&#8217;s the first time it&#8217;s being used for an election. &#8220;By providing voters with enhanced visibility on the location of their ballot, I believe this will help to continue boosting voter confidence and improve overall election security,&#8221; Neal Kelley, the registrar of voters, said in a statement. Mail-in ballots will include information on where to find the specially-equipped ballot boxes, the agency said.</p>
