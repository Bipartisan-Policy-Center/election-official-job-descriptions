														<p><strong>Countdown to Election Day 2022: An October Surprise</strong><br />
<em>Electionline Moving to New Permanent Home at the Election Center</em></p>

<p>Today,<a href="https://democracyfund.org/"> Democracy Fund</a> is excited to announce that the<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/"> Election Center</a> will be the new permanent home of electionline.org. The Election Center, also known as the National Association of Election Officials, is proud to take this on as a service to the entire elections community – in addition to the ongoing services it offers to its members – and is committed to ensuring the website continues to be a public resource.</p>
<div id="attachment_8945" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8945" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-8945 size-medium" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ERIP-300x116.png" alt="" width="300" height="116" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ERIP-300x116.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ERIP-1024x397.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ERIP-768x298.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ERIP.png 1340w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8945" class="wp-caption-text"><em>The very first electionline logo.</em></p></div>
<p>While Democracy Fund has been honored to serve as electionline’s home, this is a piece of infrastructure that should be run by and for the field and not by philanthropy. As we look to the future and election officials’ growing needs, Democracy Fund’s new strategic shift will support election administration in new ways—with an emphasis on how to properly fund and staff election infrastructure, infuse a racial justice lens into election administration, and disincentivize leaders from undermining election results.</p>
<p>The Election Center has long been a critical resource for election officials, and the organization will continue electionline’s long tradition of offering politics-free news and information about the people and processes that guide our nation’s elections. This partnership between the Election Center, founded in the 1980s, and electionline – which just celebrated its 21st anniversary – is a powerful combination that will  continue supporting the election community through daily and weekly updates on current election news and bring a centralized voice to coordinate and advance the community moving forward.</p>
<div id="attachment_8948" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8948" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-8948 size-medium" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/PewLogo-300x89.png" alt="" width="300" height="89" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/PewLogo-300x89.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/PewLogo-768x228.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/PewLogo.png 948w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8948" class="wp-caption-text"><em>electionline was at times a grantee of and also a project of The Pew Center on the States from 2001 to 2014.</em></p></div>
<p>&#8220;We are so excited for this new opportunity to partner with another long-established and essential voice in the elections community,” said Susan Gill, chair of the Board of Directors of the Election Center and former Supervisor of Elections for Citrus County, Florida. “As the new permanent home for electionline, the Election Center is committed to continuing to provide this as a free service to all people interested in election administration.”</p>

<p><strong>Next Steps</strong><br />
The transfer will take place over the next few months, and the Election Center will take over full ownership of this unique election community resource in the new year, with editor and writer Mindy Moretti remaining at the helm. Our shared goal is to maintain as seamless service as possible through Election Day on November 8, but you may see some minor changes. The Election Center will share additional updates in the future.</p>

Also known as the National Association of Election Officials, the organization was founded in the 1980s as a non-profit organization designed to promote, preserve, and improve democracy, and professionalize the field of elections. Its members include government employees whose profession is to serve in voter registration and election administration (i.e., voter registrars, election supervisors, election directors, city clerk/city secretaries, county clerks, county recorders, state election directors, Secretaries of State, and state legislative staff), suppliers of election products and services, and other election stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Election Center is the profession’s premier training and certification organization and home to the Institute for Election Administration Research &amp; Practice and Journal of Election Administration Research &amp; Practice in partnership with faculty at Auburn University. Since its creation, the Election Center has acted as a catalyst for new ideas to work with difficult issues, including forming and incubating the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED) until the organization could operate on its own; developing the first Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct for voter registrars and election administrators; working with the United States Postal Service to foment the creation of the Elections Mail Logo; and creating the National Task Force on Voting Accessibility and the National Task Force on Election Reform, among others.</p>

<p><strong>electionline.org</strong><br />
Electionline.org serves as an essential stop for news and information for election administrators, advocates, and journalists—before, during, and after election cycles. We believe the site can help readers navigate a maze of information and point to trustworthy resources and ideas to improve the voting experience for the American people.</p>
<p><a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/09-29/#tab-2">Over the last 21 years</a>, Doug Chapin, founder and current editor Mindy Moretti have provided a unique place where election administrators can find news relevant to their work — apart from political horse races and partisan campaign rhetoric. Daily and weekly content illustrates the routine business of our American elections and features stories ranging from serious issues with ballots to lighthearted moments with poll workers.</p>
<p>Learn more about the history of electionline.org from past announcements in 2014<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2014/02-13/"> here</a> and 2018<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2018/10-18/"> here</a>.</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: From Adam Ambrogi and Stacey Scholl in the early days to Lindsay Daniels and Ebony West more recently—and of course Tammy Patrick throughout—I just wanted to express my gratitude to the Democracy Fund for stepping up in 2014 and taking over the funding of electionline. Not only did they keep the lights on, they also helped electionline grow while still maintaining its unique voice in the elections community. I’m looking forward to electionline being a part of the Election Center for years to come.—Mindy Moretti)</em></p>

							<h2>Bipartisan Policy Center Report</h2>
														<p><strong>New Bipartisan Policy Center Report</strong>:<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/poll-worker-policy/"> Fortifying Elections through Poll Worker Policy</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5432" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png" alt="" width="300" height="90" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01.png 638w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Partisan organizations with nefarious intent are recruiting and training temporary election workers – some with the aim of undermining free and fair elections in pursuit of partisan goals.</p>
<p>The Bipartisan Policy Center’s report released this week,<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/poll-worker-policy/"> Fortifying Elections through Poll Worker Policy</a>, unveils a 50-state and DC dataset on current temporary election worker policy, highlighting the litany of protections in place and the gaps that remain.</p>
<p>Most states provide quality training, administer oaths of office, and implement partisan parity laws to ensure transparency and accountability in temporary election workers. Many states have clearly defined policies to address the intentional disruption of voting, dereliction of duties by an election worker, and a process for removing individuals who are not fulfilling their duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, states have implemented safeguards to ensure reliable and trustworthy election workers:</p>
<ul>
<li>42 states and DC require training for temporary election workers</li>
<li>40 states and DC require election workers to take an oath before beginning their duties in an election office</li>
<li>47 states strive for partisan balance in the makeup of temporary election workers, which helps ensure bipartisan involvement in all steps of the election process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report builds on<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/poll-worker-policy/"> a statement</a> released earlier this month and endorsed by the Bipartisan Policy Center’s<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/elections-task-force/"> Task Force on Elections</a> that condemns “any effort designed with the intent of using temporary election workers to undermine the credibility of the election ecosystem.”</p>
<p>In tandem with the policies in place that safeguard elections from threats, several states have introduced policy to increase legal protections for election workers facing threats and intimidation. Colorado, Maine and Oregon have passed laws that enhance legal protection for their election workers. All states have a mechanism of protecting public servants. These laws, along with increased attention from the Department of Justice, serve as the<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/deterring-threats-to-election-workers/"> first step</a> toward deterring and safeguarding our elections from threats.</p>

							<h2>Additional Resources for the Coming Weeks</h2>
														<p><strong>Countdown to 2022: Additional Resources</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this month, electionline Weekly brought a<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/10-06/"> list of resources</a> to help elections officials get through the coming weeks. We’ve got a few more to add to that list this week:</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5970" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USDR-300x105.png" alt="" width="223" height="78" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USDR-300x105.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/USDR.png 666w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" />Digital Assistance</strong><br />
Last week, Rachel Raper, Director of Elections at Orange County, NC, reached out to<a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"> U.S. Digital Response</a> with an interesting request. Her county needed a simple public-facing wait time tracker for their 6 early voting sites. Nothing fancy, just a table on her website for voters to see how long the wait times are at each site during the early voting period. Our intrepid group of volunteers had something setup for Rachel within 2 days and you can see the end result on her<a href="https://www.orangecountync.gov/3013/Early-Voting-Wait-Time-Tracker"> website</a>. To see how this tool works, watch this<a href="https://youtu.be/Z6bSpMBDgDg"> 6 minute demo</a>. If you would like this setup for your jurisdiction or have another digital need,<a href="https://form.jotform.com/201195733501145"> let us know</a>! Now that we have the basic structure for this wait time tool, we could have you up and running in about a day.  <a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/">U.S. Digital Response</a>. We’re fast, free, and nonpartisan. (&#8211;Lynn Constable with USDR)</p>

*New* Non-Confrontational Techniques for Election Workers Training provides an overview of non-confrontational techniques to help election officials and poll workers recognize potentially escalating situations, determine if emergency response is needed, safely de-escalate, and report appropriately within their organization or to law enforcement. In addition to this training, CISA offers other no-cost trainings (available both in-person and virtually) on topics such as election security best practices to build trust, ransomware, and phishing as well as exercise services to enhance security and resilience of election infrastructure.</p>

<a href="https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/resources/deescalation-toolkit/">De-Escaltion Toolkit</a>: Planning and preparation before Election Day can help you and your staff protect the rights of voters and the public and resist efforts to disrupt your elections. This toolkit provides ideas and practical advice to help with that planning. We know that many election offices don’t have all the resources they need.

In<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/georgia-launches-text-alert-system-notify-officials-threats-polls-rcna52530"> Georgia</a>, the secretary of state’s office has created an incident reporting system for those working at the polls. Gabriel Sterling in the secretary of state’s office told NBC News he goal is to give county directors and state officials “real-time intelligence” from each of the state’s 159 counties. “We are putting this in the hands of the poll managers and the elections directors so the responsible parties can get the information to the right people at the right time,” he said. The alert system, which was activated Monday, the first day of early voting in the state, will allow poll managers in every precinct to text a special five-digit number to report any threats or concerning activities at their polling locations. The information will then be sent to county election offices and the secretary of state&#8217;s Elections Division during the early voting period and to the secretary of state’s “war room” — a command center where law enforcement and other officials gather — that will be set up on Election Day. In<a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/10/18/colorado-rolls-out-new-language-assistance-hotline-to-help-non-english-speaking-voters/"> Colorado</a>, the secretary of state’s office has launched a new hotline that allows voters to receive real time translation of their ballot content from a live interpreter. Spanish, Korean, Mandarin, Taiwanese and Vietnamese translators are available on call. Other languages are available upon request, according to a release from the office. After dialing in, users will be patched into a three-way phone conversation with a state or county election worker and a state-certified interpreter fluent in the language they request.  The hotline only provides translations of ballot content — not for the Blue Book, according to the release. Interpreters can instruct voters on how to fill in ovals or make corrections. They will also be able to explain how people should properly sign and seal their ballots.</p>

Joe Scott, the county’s supervisor of elections, said the planning of the state-of-the-art facility took into account that the general election is during hurricane season and that the public needs to be aware of what is happening inside the facility. “It was really important for us to think about these things like how do you combat misinformation how do you make sure people can see what is happening inside an elections facility,” Scott said.  The design also took into account the possibility of long lines to drop off ballots.

Both are advertising and graphic design students at Rowan-Cabarrus Community College. Open to all residents of Rowan and Cabarrus counties, the contest invited participants to create “I Voted” and “I Registered” sticker designs. The winning designs were selected anonymously by board of elections representatives in each county. “We are honored to have had such a high caliber of entries from across two counties, and we are thrilled with the designers’ support of the electoral process,” said Jenn Gardner Selby, chair of the Rowan-Cabarrus Department of Art &amp; Design. “Stickers are limited edition, so we encourage voters to get to the polls early!” In other sticker news, the<a href="https://www.news10.com/news/ulster-county-news/lawmakers-to-honor-i-voted-sticker-contest-winner/"> Ulster County, New York</a> Legislature will honor Hudson Rowan, winner of the 2022 “I Voted” sticker contest. “The Legislature is honored to recognize Hudson’s ‘I Voted’ sticker design that has struck such a deep nerve not only in Ulster County but across the country,” said Legislative Chair Tracey Bartels. “Hudson’s crazed, wild-eyed spider robot creature has genuinely tapped into what it feels like to participate in our democracy.

It went a bit viral back then with a friend even messaging me Spain inquiring as to whether I’d been at the Nats game the night before.  Then, for some reason, the photo popped up on another Twitter account this weekend where it’s garnered more than 114,000 likes and counting. I didn’t even realize it had gone viral again until someone from CISA slid into my DMs and gave me a heads up. Despite all the comments on Twitter, I actually had the t-shirt custom made (the front says VOTE). Moral of this story? Everything old is new again, and you just never know who may be sitting behind you a sporting event.</p>

Mayor Pro Tem Steve Ward, District 3 Councilmember Joe Anderson and Councilmember At-Large Rita Russell voted against it.  Cheryl Wink, Englewood&#8217;s other at-large council member, was absent. State law still empowers local officials to enforce the open carry ban and the Englewood City Attorney&#8217;s Office has asked the county clerk&#8217;s office to post signage of the ban at the county ballot box near the city&#8217;s civic center building. But without a formal alignment of city code with state law, Deputy City Attorney Victoria McDermott said “it’s possible&#8221; the city could still encounter issues around open carrying of firearms near voting sites.  &#8220;We don’t want to run into an issue where there is a question of whether or not this is in fact prohibited or not,&#8221; McDermott said. “Ultimately, we’re trying to ensure that voters aren’t intimidated at the ballot box.&#8221;  Councilmembers who voted against the ordinance did so on grounds of what they said were possible infringements of constitutional rights.</p>

Gretchen Whitmer has signed a bill into law that will make it easier for local elections officials to find<a href="https://thelivingstonpost.com/whitmer-signs-bollins-plan-to-expand-polling-place-options-into-law/"> polling places</a>. Currently, school buildings, fire stations, police stations and other publicly owned buildings must be used as polling locations. If it is not possible or convenient to use a publicly owned building, a township or city may opt to use a building owned by a nonprofit entity. House Bill 6071, sponsored by Rep. Ann Bollin, R-Brighton, expands the options for polling places beginning in 2023 to include public banquet centers or clubhouses, such as those at large apartment complexes or senior housing facilities, as long as the building is not owned by a candidate for office or someone who runs a political action committee. The reform has long been a priority for Michigan’s municipal clerks.</p>

City officials adopted the measure after a poll worker shortage during the spring primary elections. Council members voted on two measures, one with the Communications Workers of America, local 4502, and one with American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Ohio Council 8, Local 1632. It will allow the workers to help staff the polls on election day throughout the city.  “We know that other communities have done similar things across the nation we want to be progressive here in Columbus and let people know that you know we&#8217;re backing our employees for the opportunity to serve, “ said Columbus City Councilman Emmanuel Remy, who sponsored a poll worker protection act last week. He said they want to give workers an opportunity to help alleviate the poll worker shortages. “We certainly encourage people to do so I mean it is a great opportunity and we&#8217;re making the path easier for employees to contribute to this this cause,” Remy said.</p>

The legislation,<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=0034"> House Bill 34</a>, which is sponsored by Republican state Rep. Gary Day, outlines a set of “ballot security procedures” that counties must follow when transporting ballots that have been cast. Per the bill, ballots must be kept in a specific transportation container when they are not at a voting precinct or county election office. However, that requirement does not apply when ballots are in the custody of the U.S. Postal Service. Each container must also include a “bill of lading,” which will list the location, date and time of when the ballots were collected. The bill also grants poll watchers the right to know how many ballot containers exist in a given election.</p>

The municipality would have to reimburse the county clerk&#8217;s office for the cost of running the ranked choice election. The committee advanced the bill on an 8-5 vote. It will have to be voted on during the next legislative session before it could go into effect. This specific bill would only allow ranked choice voting for nonpartisan races. The legislation was<a href="https://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/lawmakers-table-sweeping-election-reform-bill-move-forward-ranked-choice-pilot/article_64ec767a-4e3f-11ed-9d74-6f83a26a4bd5.html"> tabled</a> when it reached the full Legislature.</p>
<p>The Corporations Committee also advanced a bill that would<a href="https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/news/2022-10-17/lawmakers-push-testifiers-for-evidence-of-voter-fraud-but-come-up-empty-handed"> codify the election equipment guidelines</a> Wyoming already follows — and which are already followed by every other state. &#8220;This doesn&#8217;t really establish anything new,&#8221; Wyoming’s Election Director Kai Schon said. &#8220;It really just simply protects that process by codifying it.&#8221; But when lawmakers discussed the bill, it set off a lengthy debate surrounding allegations of voter fraud. Several public commenters derided the bill, arguing that electronic vote-counting systems weren&#8217;t safe and shouldn&#8217;t be used and advocating for a hand-count. The bill advanced out of committee on a 12-1 vote. It can now head to the full legislature for further consideration during the next session.</p>

Brian Mast, in which she claimed “fraud, misconduct and corruption.” Martz, an attorney who represented herself, failed &#8220;to state a cause of action,&#8221; according to the Oct. 7 ruling by Dempsey. &#8220;The facts alleged were insufficient to change or place in doubt the result of the election.&#8221; Martz had asked the judge to set aside the results of the Republican primary for the U.S. House District 21 seat that represents Martin, St. Lucie and parts of Palm Beach. The 178-page complaint Martz filed Sept. 9 contains no evidence to prove her claims. It only lists myriad unsubstantiated accusations, rumors and speculation “which have caused suspicion around the idea we have free and fair election,” she wrote. In her complaint, Martz demanded all three counties&#8217; elections offices give her the cast vote record, which is the raw data used to tabulate results. The defendants she listed were the Florida State Canvassing Commission, each county&#8217;s canvassing board and Mast himself.</p>

The lawsuit, filed by Morgan County residents Lori Tullos and Virginia McFadden, is against the Morgan County Board of Elections and Registration, Morgan County’s Elections Director Jennifer Doran, Chairman of the BOER James Woodard and all sitting board members, as well as Georgia’s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. The 186-page complaint lobs numerous accusations against Raffensperger, state voting officials, and the Morgan County BOER officials, including claims that Georgia’s electronic voting machines do not accurately record votes as cast and are susceptible to foreign interference and tampering from countries like China and Iran. The lawsuit also alleges Georgia’s voting machines are “unconstitutional” and accuses Raffensperger of “fraud,” “intimidation” and “violating his oath of office.” The suit also claims Morgan County voters were deprived of their right to a referendum to vote on switching from paper ballots to electronic voting machines and whether or not to approve funding to pay for the new voting machines when they were adopted by the state in 2017. The suit, filed on Oct. 11, is asking the Morgan County Superior Court to “grant the utilization of the illegal Dominion ICX voting systems in Morgan County and GA to be immediately discontinued as voter disenfranchisement and the abridgment of our right to vote is imminent.” The suit also asks the court to “grant a referendum vote by the electors of Morgan County to decide on the use of any voting machines, as is required by law, prior to any further machine voting. And that, this referendum vote needs to be done by hand marked paper ballots that are hand counted as this could have been the process if the law would have been followed prior to the machines being installed.” The suit also calls for a referendum on the use of county funds to pay for any approved voting machines/systems.</p>

Some of those involved with the lawsuit are also individuals who took part in a recount of the 2022 primary election based on unfounded allegations of fraud. Others have testified in legislative hearings on perceived flaws in Kansas election administration. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court for the District of Kansas last month, relies on largely baseless allegations that the state has been using erroneous voting machines and has been the subject of fraud. It wants Gov. Laura Kelly to void the 2020 general election and 2022 primary election results and order a redo, something that cannot be done under state law. It also wants elections in Kansas to be conducted entirely by paper ballots. Crabtree indicated during a hearing that he was unlikely to grant the motion and his ruling largely picks apart the case made by the plaintiffs. It is largely pessimistic about the odds of the larger lawsuit to find any success. Elected officials, he said, &#8220;have chosen processes and methods to use in the state’s elections.&#8221; &#8220;It may not represent the system that plaintiffs prefer, and our Constitution entitles them to express their opinions,&#8221; Crabtree wrote. &#8220;But nothing in the current record entitles them to sweeping use of federal judicial power to impose their views on their state or their fellow Kansans.&#8221; Those bringing the lawsuit, Crabtree said, do not have the standing to do so, as they have not demonstrated they have been directly harmed by the issues they allege.</p>

County officials asked the Minnesota Supreme Court for direction on fixing ballots that failed to include political affiliation in all partisan races and incumbency status for judges as required by law. In their petitions, election officials in the two counties say the information was inadvertently left off ballots by a printing vendor. Both use SeaChange Printing and Marketing for their mail and absentee ballot programs. In both cases, party labels were assigned only in the governor’s race and not any other state or federal contests. Both rural counties rely heavily on mail ballots, not all of which had been sent when the problem was discovered. Court papers say only 25 voters had returned ballots in Kittson County as of late last week. Martha Monsrud, who oversees elections in Roseau County, said 124 ballots had been returned to her office before the problem surfaced. She said a voter alerted her to the omissions. The high court has fast-tracked the cases.</p>

Beetem ruled that the plaintiffs — the Missouri NAACP and League of Women Voters of Missouri, along with two voters — didn’t have the standing to bring the case because they couldn’t provide evidence of harm. However, the voting advocates who filed the case in August say the ruling is a “procedural pit stop” on the way to the Missouri Supreme Court, noting that the ruling doesn’t address the legality of the new state law. “This is a procedural ruling,” said Denise Lieberman, director and general counsel for the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition. “This case will be decided by the Missouri Supreme Court, which has twice concluded that limiting the forms of voter ID in the very way that this law does violates the Missouri Constitution and Missourians ’ right to vote. So this is not the end of the line for this lawsuit in any way, shape, or form.” Lieberman said the judge did not dismiss the case outright but offered the opportunity to amend the pleadings to provide the specificity that he believes is warranted. Currently, voters can present a variety of different forms of identification at the polls, including some that don’t include a photo, like a utility bill or voting card. Under the new law, registered voters would either have to get a government-issued photo ID or cast a provisional ballot on Election Day.</p>

The plan was spurred by false claims of election fraud. Wanker said the ACLU did not provide a recording or transcript of the publicly available Nye County Board of Commissioners meeting referenced in the organization’s petition. The judge said it was unreasonable for the court to access the video and watch a 7-hour, 23-minute video to find a presentation on the plan. She also said there was no certificate of service in the file that indicated the respondents were served with an emergency petition. The ACLU Nevada has filed an<a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2022/10/17/aclu-ballot-counting-lawsuit-nevada-supreme-court/10527790002/"> emergency petition with the state Supreme Court</a>. The complaint is nearly identical to the ACLU lawsuit that was recently dismissed in Nye County District Court due to technicalities. The ACLU asked the court to rule by October 21, five days before Nye County officials plan to start early hand-counting of mail-in ballots and one day before early in-person voting starts statewide.</p>

Rozier granted one of the party’s two requests related to the work of “at-large” observers chosen by political parties and who are allowed to monitor more than one voting site. A second request seeking the use of more than one such observer simultaneously at a location was denied, according to a GOP leader and the State Board of Elections, which is a lawsuit defendant. Rozier also refused another GOP demand that he block the State Board of Elections from extending the fall absentee-ballot receipt deadline based on the Veterans Day holiday on November 11th, board spokesperson Pat Gannon said. The GOP won in a portion of the litigation filed last month requesting a preliminary injunction on state board guidance that requires an at-large observer to work for at least four hours before they can be replaced at a voting site.</p>
<p>North Carolina’s top legislative leaders believe a federal judge<a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/legislators-urge-federal-judge-to-toss-out-unaffiliated-voters-election-lawsuit/"> should dismiss a lawsuit</a> that aims to add unaffiliated voters to the state’s elections board. House Speaker Tim Moore, R-Cleveland, and Senate leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, filed a motion to dismiss the case Common Cause v. Moore. Common Cause and five individual unaffiliated voters are challenging a state law, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 163-19. It dictates the terms of state elections board membership. The governor appoints the five-member board, based on recommendations from the two major parties. The governor’s party exercises a 3-2 majority. “Plaintiffs argue that by not allowing unaffiliated voters to serve on the State Board, their First Amendment and Equal Protection rights are violated. However, these Plaintiffs lack standing to bring those claims,”<a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/3694884-0-32603.pdf"> wrote</a> legislators’ attorneys. “And Defendants, members of the legislative branch, who enact but do not enforce laws, are immune from suit for such claims in federal court.” The Common Cause suit filed Aug. 2 asks a federal court to declare the elections board law “unconstitutional and void.” Common Cause also asks the court to block the General Assembly from enacting any new law for state elections board appointments that “discriminates against unaffiliated voters or penalizes them based on their decisions not to register as Republican[s] or Democrats.”</p>

Tom Wolf’s administration’s guidance to counties to include<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/10/pas-handling-of-undated-mail-in-ballots-become-the-subject-of-yet-another-lawsuit.html"> undated mailed ballots</a> in their official vote count. The voters filed the case in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court asking for an expedited review of a case dealing with undated mail-in ballots. Specifically, they are asking for the state’s high court to skip a review by lower courts and to order undated mailed ballots not to be counted. At minimum, they ask the court to order the segregation of incorrectly dated or undated ballots. The U.S. Supreme Court ruling came in a case involving a Lehigh County judicial race. The high court vacated a regional federal court decision that ordered timely received undated mailed ballots to be counted. Wolf Administration officials interpreted that ruling as saying the lower court ruling was “moot” because the race at issue in that case had already been decided.</p>
<p>Lehigh County Judge Thomas Capehart has rejected a lawsuit by four residents who demanded tighter<a href="https://www.governing.com/now/lehigh-county-judge-rejects-ballot-box-restrictions"> restrictions on ballot drop boxes</a>. The plaintiffs, all Republicans, demanded the boxes at the government center in Allentown and other parts of the county be open only during “normal” business hours and be monitored in person to make sure voters drop only their own ballots, or ballots they have been authorized to drop. Capehart said evidence presented at hearings on the case showed in-person monitoring had not conclusively reduced third-party ballot dropping, but better education, publicity and signage had succeeded in doing so. Capehart also said the county had made its case that it would be too difficult to hire and train drop box observers in such a short time, meaning the boxes, which many voters rely on, would be eliminated. “With better and clearer information being provided to voters by the [county election board] and with this information being publicly disseminated to the electorate in a timely fashion, the integrity of mail-in voting via drop boxes in Lehigh County remains safe and secure,” the judge wrote.</p>

The groups are demanding that the Board of Elections honor its obligation to provide Spanish-language ballots, election materials and assistance to voters within the county. The lawsuit is also seeking a preliminary injunction ordering the Board of Elections to provide Spanish sample ballots and signage and training for poll workers on the rights of Spanish-language voters.</p>

Authorities say Jennifer Fleck was working as a poll watcher on Nov. 2, 2020, when she refused to leave a piece of property owned by Travis County after interfering with employees who were counting ballots, a statement from the DA&#8217;s office said. Fleck is also accused of recording both audio and video of workers counting ballots, which is against state election laws. “Our state’s election laws prohibit poll watchers from filming and photographing during the election count process to prevent any interference and protect the legitimacy of the election outcome,” Travis County District Attorney José Garza said in a statement. “Our office will ensure a fair election by guarding against any interference and holding accountable anyone violating our election laws.” The Travis County district attorney’s office was appointed to prosecute these misdemeanor cases in the place of the county attorney’s office because the county attorney&#8217;s office represented the Travis County clerk in civil litigation as the facts of these cases unfolded, the DA&#8217;s office said. Fleck will appear in court next on Nov. 3.</p>

The Court ruled the plaintiffs failed to prove the US District Court had jurisdiction over their case. The lawsuit filed was 1 of 4 similar lawsuits filed against county auditors across Washington by Washington Election Integrity Coalition United (WEICU), a group challenging 2020 General Election results and seeking a full forensic audit of the Washington election system, similar to an audit done in Maricopa County, Arizona.</p>

The suit and a request for a temporary injunction comes a month after a Waukesha County judge ruled clerks cannot correct incomplete witness addresses.  The League is suing the Wisconsin Elections Commission in Dane County Circuit Court. The group is asking Judge Nia Trammell for a declaratory judgment aimed at clarifying state statute barring clerks from counting a ballot if the envelope, also referred to as a witness certificate, &#8220;is missing the address&#8221; of that individual.  A brief filed by LWM, argues &#8220;the common-sense, plain-language definition&#8221; of the word &#8220;missing&#8221; only applies to &#8220;circumstances in which the address field is left completely blank&#8221; on absentee ballot envelopes. During a hearing, Attorney Dan Lenz, who is representing LWM, said ballots with witness certificates that include a partial address or even just the name of a municipality should not be rejected. He said current law creates confusion among clerks that could cause votes not to be counted.</p>
