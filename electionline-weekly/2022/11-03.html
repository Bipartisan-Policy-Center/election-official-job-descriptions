														<p><strong>Countdown to Election Day 2022: What to Watch</strong><br />
<em>What we’ll be watching on November 8</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8343" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In the two years since the November 2020 election — which was, without a doubt, unprecedented — elections officials and voters have been through a lot.</p>
<p>New laws, redistricting, threats, voter intimidation, attrition, hurricanes, fires, floods, rampant mis/disinformation, deluges of records requests and supply chain issues including paper shortages, just to name a few.</p>
<p>But here we are on the eve of the 2022 Midterm Election and officials are as prepared and ready as they can be.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to watch on Tuesday and we of course, will be keeping an eye on everything, but these are some of the major issues, in no particular order, we’ll be tuned into.</p>
<p>We’ll be posting our<a href="https://electionline.org/weekly/november-8-2022/"> Election Dispatches</a> throughout the day more or less around 9am, 12pm, 3pm, 6pm, and 8pm. Depending on how things go we may add more dispatches as the situation warrants.</p>
<p>Good luck and godspeed to all the elections officials and poll workers out there. May the gods of democracy have mercy on our souls!</p>
<p><strong>Threats to Democracy</strong><br />
Following the 2020 election cycle we had sort of hoped we could stop using the word unprecedented, but<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/facing-threats-violence-election-officials-growing-frustrated-doj/story?id=92495137"> elections officials</a>, temporary election workers and<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/07-21/"> poll workers</a> have received an<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/election-officials-are-bracing-trouble-still-hoping-best-rcna53777"> unprecedented number of threats</a> to their lives and the lives of their families since the 2020 election. Will Election Day and the days that follow remain calm, not only at the polls, but also at counting <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8677" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-300x250.png" alt="" width="300" height="250" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-300x250.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-1024x852.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-768x639.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted.png 1158w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />facilities and to be blunt, in the nation as a whole? Driven by lies and misinformation, more<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/25/pro-trump-republicans-court-election-volunteers-challenge-any-vote/"> poll watchers</a> than ever are expected at the polls on Tuesday as well as at ballot counting facilities. In addition to threats to elections workers, there have been growing concerns about<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/03/us/politics/voting-intimidation-democracy.html"> voter intimidation</a>. There have already been issues of voter intimidation during early voting like<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-voting-rights-phoenix-a4c9d98e4da6eb175ea5eb72a37207ed"> Arizona</a> and<a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/2022-election/os-ne-politics-2022-election-central-florida-low-turnout-20221101-g6iutzg7ffabnj76zpn7tr2poi-story.html"> Florida</a>.</p>
<p><strong>On the Ballot</strong><br />
The<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/10-27/"> state’s top elections official</a> is on the ballot in 24 states on November 8 and in several states, including Alaska, Florida, Pennsylvania and Texas, who wins the governor’s seat will determine who runs that state’s elections In<a href="https://www.wpr.org/normally-quiet-secretary-state-race-erupts-questions-elections-power-and-democracy"> Wisconsin</a>, while the secretary of state does not currently have oversight of elections, if Republicans take control of the state, they have vowed to give election oversight to the secretary of state. It’s safe to say that<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/us/politics/secretary-of-state-races-midterms.html"> more</a><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/10/27/election-deniers-already-are-disrupting-the-midterm-election"> has</a><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/24/election-deniers-secretary-of-state-00062383"> been</a><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/politics/secretary-of-state-races-to-watch/index.html"> written</a> and<a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/critical-role-secretaries-of-state-play-in-midterm-elections-1666823651/"> reported</a> at the state and national level and more money has poured into secretary of state races than ever before. According to<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/10/secretary-of-state-candidates-have-raised-a-record-56-2-million-for-2022-election/"> Open Secrets</a>, collectively secretary of state candidates have raised $56.2 million since January 2021. Democratic secretary of state candidates have raised nearly $31.6 million and Republican candidates have raised almost $23.5 million. In addition to secretary of state and local election official races, there are also numerous<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/10-13/"> elections-related ballot measures</a> this year. From statewide measures in seven states to a number of local election administration ballot measures covering everything from early voting to noncitizens to ranked choice voting to election dates.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong><br />
Will losing candidates accept the outcome of the election and if they don’t, what will that mean for elections officials? Already, some candidates have gone on the record and said they won’t accept the results if they lose. During a speech to the nation on November 2, President Biden<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-give-speech-democracy-wednesday-capitol-hill-adviser-2022-11-02/"> spoke directly to this issue</a>. Biden said that threats by some candidates to refuse to accept results from the Nov. 8 elections if they lose is a threat to democracy. &#8220;Make no mistake, democracy is on the ballot for all of us,&#8221; Biden said</p>
<p><strong>Redistricting</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8105" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-300x232.png" alt="" width="300" height="232" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-300x232.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-768x593.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted.png 922w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Following the 2020 Census and redistricting<a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/05/20/check-your-polling-place-redistricting-confused-some-voters"> will voters know where to go and vote on Election Day</a>? “Even experienced voters could face more uncertainty,” Jeanette Senecal, senior director of mission impact for the League of Women Voters said. “Voters can’t assume they know what the rules are—they’ve changed so much in the last three election cycles. Every voter is like a new voter with all these changes.” There were scattered reports during the primaries about voters showing up to their polling place only to discover they  had been redistricted and that also for some meant a new polling place. Primary voters tend to be a more dedicated, active group of voters who may have been more cognizant of redistricting changes, will general election voters on Election Day have issues? For instance, in<a href="https://www.governing.com/now/chicago-prepares-to-shrink-precincts-ahead-of-nov-election"> Chicago</a>, polling places have been reduced by 40 percent due to cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p><strong>Displaced Voters</strong><br />
From<a href="https://sourcenm.com/2022/10/31/how-displaced-or-unhoused-new-mexicans-can-vote/"> wild fires</a> in the West to tornadoes and floods in Kentucky to Hurricane Ian in<a href="https://www.vote.org/florida2022/"> Florida</a>, there are thousands of voters whose homes no longer exist and they are living elsewhere, either permanently or temporarily. Will these voters be able to cast ballots without issue? In addition to those natural disasters, the ongoing effects of the pandemic have<a href="https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/elections/vote/displacedVoters.html"> displaced many renters</a> who have been forced from their homes. Have these folks been able to register elsewhere? Will they be able to vote?</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong><br />
Many counties purchased new voting equipment in the past few years and a lot of voters will be seeing it for the first time. Will there <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-8732 alignleft" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LAIVoted22-227x300.png" alt="" width="227" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LAIVoted22-227x300.png 227w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LAIVoted22.png 738w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" />be issues? Will an already skeptical public accept the new equipment? Already during early voting some problems with new equipment have popped up, not necessarily with the equipment itself but with voter education around the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Litigation</strong><br />
While several lawsuits have recently been settled and probably more will be in the coming days, but there are still at<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-courts-still-grappling-with-election-lawsuits-midterms-near-2022-11-03/"> dozens upon dozens of  elections-related lawsuits outstanding</a> and Tuesday could see even more.</p>
<p><strong>New Laws</strong><br />
While pretty much every state has a new election law or two on the books since 2020, obviously not all those laws will impact voters and the administration of elections. That being said, there are new laws in several states, Georgia, Missouri and Texas for instance, that could dramatically impact the 2022 election. Early voting in<a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/201498"> Georgia</a> has been off the charts with few reports of people being impacted by the state’s new law, but when the voting window narrows to 12 hours on one day, will that remain the same? In<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/871/billtext/pdf/sb00001i.pdf"> Texas</a>, thousands of mail ballots were rejected due to the state’s new law. Elections officials have worked tirelessly since then to educate voters about the new law, but have they done enough? In<a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article265106799.html"> Missouri</a>, voters will have to show a government-issued photo ID for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Staffing</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-8591" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PimaCoAZIVoted-300x277.png" alt="" width="175" height="162" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PimaCoAZIVoted-300x277.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PimaCoAZIVoted-768x710.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PimaCoAZIVoted.png 872w" sizes="(max-width: 175px) 100vw, 175px" />Find enough Election Day staff has always been a struggle, but in the current environment it’s become even more difficult for some places. Many states have reported that while overall they have enough poll workers, even in those states there are counties still struggling to find enough people to work on Tuesday. And will there be enough<a href="https://inewsource.org/2022/10/27/bilingual-poll-workers-voters-minority-languages-election/"> bilingual poll workers</a> in the places that need them? Will poll workers and temporary election workers follow the laws or will they<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/06-09/"> consider going rogue</a>? In addition to poll workers, more<a href="https://people.com/politics/election-officials-quit-after-harassment-from-election-deniers/"> elections officials have left the field</a> in the past two years than ever before. What impacts may that attrition have on the election?</p>
<p><strong>Unknown Unknowns</strong><br />
Twenty years ago when the late Donald Rumsfeld uttered his infamous quote: <em>“Reports that say that something hasn&#8217;t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don&#8217;t know we don&#8217;t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones,”</em> no one knew just how prescient that would be for elections officials. There are the known unknowns—lines will form, equipment will fail, someone will show up late the open a polling place, a car may crash into a polling place, etc. But what we don’t know are the unknown unknowns. No matter how long and hard elections officials plan for Election Day, something unexpected — think Sharpies — will happen. What those will be for 2022 are anyone’s guess, but we’ll be sure to bring them to you via our Election Day Dispatches and right back here next week.</p>

							<h2>2022 Survey of Local Election Officials</h2>
														<p><strong>The State of Election Administration in 2022</strong></p>
<p>By Paul Gronke, Paul Manson and Tammy Patrick<br />
For The Democracy Fund</p>
<p>In a nation of over<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/30/2022-06654/estimates-of-the-voting-age-population-for-2021"> 258.3 million</a> eligible voters, election officials’ myriad duties differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction—small to large, rural to urban—and from voter to voter. Despite these many differences, there are common themes and predictable challenges faced by every official. And of course, every official has experienced unforeseen events and unexpected circumstances that force them to assess, reform, and adapt. As any official will tell you, there is always another election on the horizon.</p>
<p>The Democracy Fund/Reed College Survey of Local Election Officials provides a window into the attitudes, actions, and needs of the public servants who manage US elections. Surveys during the last three election cycles have illustrated the stable features of the system and the way that the challenges of the moment impact the people administering the democratic process.</p>
<p><strong>Local Election Officials</strong><br />
More than half of election officials are elected – 57 percent overall, but in small jurisdictions with fewer than 5,000 registered voters that increases to 67 percent – while 27 percent are appointed, and 15 percent are hired to fill a position. Just over half of these races are partisan and the other half are non-partisan, and the vast majority of elected officials (81 percent) ran uncontested in the general election. The need to attract candidates and talent will only continue to grow as veteran officials leave the field in growing numbers.</p>
<p>In the 2018 survey, officials’ recent experiences with foreign interference in election cybersecurity impacted the complexity of their work. In 2020, the pandemic and extraordinary polarization of the candidates and the electorate created stress and rapid change in methods of voting that election officials had to manage. The 2022 survey illustrates more emergent challenges as election officials report coping with the combinations of mis- and disinformation about elections, violence against election officials, and extreme partisan disparities in the public’s confidence in election results.</p>
<p>All of this is happening in an environment where the biggest disparity in the election system continues to be geographic. Elections are managed by local jurisdictions and there are tremendous differences between election offices that serve the largest and smallest populations. Seventy-five percent of all offices serve only 8 percent of voters, and 8 percent of our election offices serve 75 percent of voters. This disparity is driven by the fact that the largest 2 percent of offices serve half of the nation’s voters.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-8998" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.1.png" alt="" width="512" height="637" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.1.png 802w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.1-241x300.png 241w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.1-768x956.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p>The impact of an increased election-related workload is disproportionally higher on smaller jurisdictions than their counterparts in medium and large jurisdictions. This should not be surprising since one third of all election offices do not have even one full-time employee. In small jurisdictions that serve less than 5,000 voters that number increases to 53 percent. The increased workload for many may have been the result of concerted campaigns to flood election offices with Freedom of Information Act requests around the 2020 election based on conspiracy and conjecture.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-8999" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.2.png" alt="" width="766" height="577" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.2.png 1326w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.2-300x226.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.2-1024x771.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.2-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" /></p>
<p>Each election cycle, the Democracy Fund/Reed College Local Election Official (LEO) Survey has asked local officials about key aspects of their work including preparedness for the upcoming election, job satisfaction, and training needs for the election officials and members of their staffs.</p>
<p>LEOs retain a commitment to meeting the demands of their jobs and the challenges of finding adequate polling locations and poll workers – especially sufficient bilingual workers and accessible facilities – persist with varying degrees across jurisdiction sizes.</p>
<p>Overall job satisfaction among LEOs remains high, but there are cracks in the veneer. The percentage of LEOs who do not think they can maintain a work/life balance has increased and the percentage who say their workload is reasonable has dropped since 2018.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9000" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.3.png" alt="" width="541" height="274" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.3.png 1326w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.3-300x152.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.3-1024x519.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.3-768x389.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></p>
<p>Among the 2022 survey participants, close to one third of the election officials are eligible to retire before the 2024 election—and 39 percent of those eligible plan to do so. Of these respondents, retirement eligibility is the highest reason for leaving the field (51 percent) but “I do not like the changes in my work environment that occurred during and after the November 2020 election” (42 percent) and “I do not enjoy the political environment” (37 percent) followed close behind. For those who are not near retirement age their number one reason for leaving the field was cited as “changes in how elections are administered make the work unsatisfying” (48 percent) and an alarming 28 percent citing that they plan to leave the field based on “concerns about my health or personal safety, aside from COVID concerns.”</p>
<p><strong>Disruption in the Field </strong><br />
One in four respondents have experienced threats of violence. Officials across all jurisdiction sizes and political affiliations experienced these threats, but the threat environment is much more severe in larger jurisdictions compared to smaller jurisdictions. For example, while 14 percent of LEOs serving jurisdictions with less than 5,000 registered voters told us that they had experienced abuse, harassment, or threats, the percentage increases to two-thirds of LEOs serving in the largest jurisdictions. Similarly, 20 percent of LEOs who told us they were Republicans said they experienced threats, compared to 30 percent of Independents and 34 percent of Democrats. These differences should not disguise the overall result: threats against LEOs are far too real, far too regular, and far too common.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9001" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.4.png" alt="" width="616" height="279" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.4.png 1180w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.4-300x136.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.4-1024x463.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.4-768x348.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></p>
<p>The preponderance of threats targeting election officials are politically based threats. Our 2022 survey showed that 63 percent of threats received were politically motivated. The narrative driving these threats—that the 2020 election was illegitimate and that LEOs were complicit in allowing the election to be stolen–-has manifested in threats to election professionals and their families, and changes to state election laws. More than half (55 percent) of the survey respondents said that they have had legislation passed that impacts how they conduct the election—with 35 percent saying those changes improved election administration and 46 percent saying the new laws did not improve election administration.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-9002" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.5.png" alt="" width="744" height="488" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.5.png 1300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.5-300x197.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.5-1024x671.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LEOSurvey22.5-768x503.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /></p>
<p>The majority – 66 percent – of election officials surveyed this year expressed concern about threats and harassment. When asked how seriously various organizations take the threats to election officials, 43 percent said that their state’s chief election official (in most states, the secretary of state) takes the threats “very seriously.” However, LEOs felt that others took the threats far less seriously: only 27 percent for local law enforcement, 25 percent for federal law enforcement, 17 percent for the state legislature and for the national media, 14 percent for the local media, and 12 percent for the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p><strong>About the Survey and Interviews </strong><br />
The 2022 survey of local election officials was a self-administered web and hardcopy survey conducted from June 21 to September 22, 2022. This study used a LEO sample collected by the team, with a sampling frame based in part on national lists of local election officials and the sizes of their jurisdictions. From this frame, the team drew a sample of 3,118 LEOs, sampling jurisdictions in proportion to the number of registered voters they serve and targeting the chief election official in each jurisdiction to complete the survey. A total of 912 LEOs completed the survey, including 652 surveys completed via web (71 percent) and 260 (29 percent) completed via hardcopy with an overall response rate of 30 percent.</p>
<p>Survey findings are often presented by jurisdiction size to understand differences in experiences.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Fifty-seven percent of local election officials serve in jurisdictions of 5,000 or fewer voters.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Twenty-seven percent serve in jurisdictions of 5,001 to 25,000 voters.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Ten percent serve in jurisdictions of 25,001 to 75,000 voters.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Six percent serve in jurisdictions of more than 75,000 voters.</li>
</ul>
<p>While most officials serve in small jurisdictions, the vast majority of voters live in large jurisdictions — over 70 percent of voters live in jurisdictions with more than 75,000 voters and are served by only 500 officials. It’s important to consider the possible differences in scale, responsibility, and resources between different jurisdiction sizes when interpreting results from any survey of this population. Where overall results are presented, they are weighted to ensure that means can be generalized to local election officials nationwide. Further information about the sampling and weighting process is available at the Reed College Elections &amp; Voting Information Center’s<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/leo-survey-summary/"> project website</a>.</p>

Turnout remained mix. Voters continued to vote early at an unprecedented rate in Georgia while numerous Texas counties reported lower than 2018 numbers. Political pundits like to make lots of hay out of early voting numbers, but until polls close on November 8, we really won’t know if overall turnout is higher or lower than it was four years ago. For the most part, early voting has run smoothly with few reports of problems. While there have been some reports of disruptive people at the polls, the problems that have arisen have been fairly typical of any election cycle. International observers from Germany and Macedonia recently paid a visit to La Paz County,<a href="https://www.parkerpioneer.net/news/article_b1a64560-594b-11ed-9f11-3b43ee18dec2.html"> Arizona</a>.  In<a href="https://www.thv11.com/article/news/politics/elections/landers-supporters-altercation-early-voting-little-rock/91-3b48e24b-da1a-4162-a23b-32c718b6d4c6"> Arkansas</a>, there were reports that supporters of one candidate were showing concealed handguns at voters in a form of intimidation.

In Alaska, U.S. Department of Justice observers were sent to several polling locations in the August special U.S. House and primary elections to assess whether the state provided adequate accommodations for Alaska Native voters. Observers found what appeared to be continued violations of the law, including a polling place without bilingual language workers and election officials who lacked training in assisting voters who speak languages other than English. “It is frequently difficult to recruit bilingual workers, particularly in places where the residents have informed the division that they do not need language assistance. But the division is committed to providing language assistance and it believes it has complied with the stipulated order and will continue to comply with the Voting Rights Act going forward,” Gail Fenumiai, director of the Alaska Division of Elections wrote. In<a href="https://foxreno.com/newsletter-daily/fallon-paiute-shoshone-tribe-celebrates-first-polling-location-reservation-voting-polling-site-early-midterm-elections-rural-nevada-get-out-the-vote-churchill-county-community-learning-center-election-day"> Nevada</a>, members of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe have  a polling place on their tribal land in for the very first time. Following a recent court ruling that found<a href="https://www.yankton.net/community/article_ff53265e-572d-11ed-89c1-4378bb910661.html"> South Dakota</a> violated federal voting registration laws advocates of greater Native enfranchisement have worked to enlist new voters in areas such as the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations. Officials from the<a href="https://www.kfyrtv.com/2022/10/28/nddot-distributes-voter-ids-people-reservations/"> North Dakota</a> Department of Transportation traveled to four American Indian reservations this month to provide voters with photo ID cards. They went to Belcourt, Fort Yates, New Town, and Fort Totten. The DOT will do this every election year, 30 days before voting begins, as part of an agreement with the tribes. The goal is to provide voters with IDs that meet the state requirement of a provable street address. And in Apache County,<a href="https://arizona.votebeat.org/2022/11/3/23438048/navajo-nation-apache-county-native-american-voting-access"> Arizona</a>, Navajo Nation have been pushing officials to adopt vote centers, something many other Arizona counties have done and opening at least one vote center on the reservation where registered voters from anywhere in the county would be allowed to cast ballots. In 2020, voters in Apache County, which includes much of the Navajo Nation, saw a higher percentage of provisional ballots rejected than any other county in the state. The main reason registered voters’ provisional ballots were rejected in Apache was because they voted in the wrong precinct, according to a Votebeat review of federal government data from the 2020 presidential election.</p>

Last week’s renaming ceremony was attended by local, state, and University officials, as well as Wooten’s family and friends. New Jersey state Senator Shirley Turner, one of the primary sponsors of “<a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2020/S854">Laura Wooten’s Law</a>,” a statute that requires middle schools to expand civics education starting this academic year, was one of the state officials in attendance.  “Laura Wooten was not born with a silver spoon in her mouth. She was a cafeteria worker who believed in voting and civic responsibility. The stories of ordinary people are not told or recognized often enough, yet they are the people who bring about change and movements,” Turner told The Daily Princetonian in an email. <em>[Photo provided to the Daily Princetonian by Caasi Love, grandson of Laura Wooten</em>.]</p>

Telling the difference between a good post-election audit and a sham review may not be straightforward. Several groups have identified best practices for audits, but there currently exist no set of broadly agreed upon or mandatory standards for election audit procedures, nor a certification regime for auditors themselves.  Outside groups are often recruited to perform audits, either because they have special expertise or to ensure that the election is evaluated independently from the officials who carried it out. But there is currently no formal way to distinguish a qualified election auditor from an unqualified would-be election reviewer in the way that we distinguish licensed doctors from unlicensed quacks. In this report, we identify the ways that sham reviews harm voters, taxpayers, and trust in elections overall. We also share ways for observers to distinguish good post-election audits from sham reviews. Finally, we propose some options for creating formal distinctions between these kinds of reviews, including standards for post-election audits or a credentialing system for post-election auditors. Implementing standards for audit procedures or auditors themselves would make it easier for observers and journalists to credibly identify sham reviews, potentially disincentivizing sham reviews from being carried out in the first place. Having standards in place should also improve the quality and consistency of post-election audits in general, just as<a href="https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/voluntary-voting-system-guidelines"> voluntary federal guidelines</a> have enabled improvements to American voting systems.</p>

County Clerk Becky Rossell, who was served with Rick Hill’s lawsuit Oct. 12, also urged Lincoln County voters to ignore “national misinformation” from election-fraud theorists urging them to deliver early ballots to in-person polling places during next Tuesday’s election. Hill, who lists a southwest Lincoln address, filed his lawsuit Sept. 2 against Omaha-based Election Systems &amp; Software — which supplies Nebraska’s election equipment — along with Gov. Pete Ricketts, Secretary of State Bob Evnen, Attorney General Doug Peterson, Speaker of the Legislature Mike Hilgers and the 93 election commissioners. In a nine-page complaint in Lancaster County District Court, he demanded the seizure of ES&amp;S, state and county records from the November 2020 election; a hand recount of its results; a state law outlawing early ballots and mandating paper ballots and hand-counting; and a halt to construction of casinos at horse tracks under petition initiatives voters approved in 2020.</p>

Phil Murphy signed in January banning police from polling places altogether. While voting rights advocates celebrated that law as a victory against voter suppression, legislators just weeks later introduced the rollback bill after worrying the new law leaves students and seniors — two vulnerable groups that have been targeted by mass shooters around the country — unprotected. The Senate approved an earlier version of the bill in June. It must now approve the amended version approved by the Assembly before it heads to Murphy’s desk. Gov. Phil Murphy addressed the measure on Monday during his monthly &#8220;Ask the Governor&#8221; call-in show. “All this is about being sensible, responsible, certainly, first and foremost, keeping our blessed kids safe and sound. But I do think the disproportionate amount of intimidation if you look at our country’s history, has been in communities of color and that is for sure,” Murphy said.</p>

The $130,000 approved this week will go toward voter education for the Nov. 8 election, which takes place next week, and for exit polling and other research which will determine the voter education plan for 2023. Nine commissioners voted in favor of the funding, while Commissioner Erika Sugarmon voted “no” and Commissioner Henri Brooks abstained. Two days before that, Shelby County Commissioners were asked to approve $81,930 for poll worker training and $413,250 for voter education. Commissioners approved the funds for training poll workers via video, but delayed their decision on the voter education funding.</p>

Liburdi said members of Clean Elections USA, its leader and anyone working with them are also barred from filming or following anyone within 75 feet of a ballot drop box or the entrance to a building that houses one. They also cannot speak to or yell at individuals within that perimeter unless spoken to first. The temporary restraining order was requested by the League of Women Voters of Arizona after Clean Elections USA, encouraged people to watch 24-hour ballot boxes in Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous county. “It is paramount that we balance the rights of the defendant to engage in their constitutionally protected First Amendment activity with the interest in the plaintiffs and in voters casting a vote free of harassment and intimidation,” Liburdi said. A second set of defendants in rural Yavapai County — groups known as the Lions of Liberty and the Yavapai County Preparedness team, who are associated with the far-right anti-government group Oath Keepers — were dismissed from the case after they pledged to stand down their operations. The temporary order issued by Liburdi on Tuesday will be in effect for two weeks and the cooperation from the monitoring group “shall not be construed as an admission they have engaged in any of these activities,” the judge added. The 250-foot perimeter around drop boxes also applies to group members wearing body armor. Other stipulations include the groups post on their websites and social media that it is untrue that dropping off multiple ballots is illegal in all cases. Exceptions are allowed for family members, members of the same household and caregivers. Late last week, Liburdi had<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-arizona-voting-phoenix-44809c62794456afee434672da6ef115"> refused to bar a group from monitoring</a> outdoor ballot but at the times said the case remained open and that the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans could try again to make its argument against a group calling itself Clean Elections USA. A second plaintiff, Voto Latino, was removed from the case. A the time, the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans and Voto Latino have<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/29/politics/arizona-voter-intimidation-appeal-lawsuit/index.html"> appealed the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court</a>. “Absent emergency relief, Defendants’ ongoing campaign of voter intimidation at ballot drop boxes in Arizona will continue and likely get worse, irreparably depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote freely and without intimidation through the means that Arizona law provides, and irreparably harming Plaintiffs and their members,” the request with the 9th Circuit said.</p>
<p>The Arizona Alliance of Retired Americans filed suit this week in an attempt to<a href="https://www.whec.com/politics-news/arizona-countys-ballot-hand-count-plan-challenged-in-court/"> stop Cochise county from hand-counting ballots</a>. State law on hand counts, which are usually limited to a small percentage of the votes, says party chairs from at least two recognized parties must provide a list of people to help count the vote and no more than 75% can be from the same party.  The counts would be in addition to the official machine tabulation. The presiding judge sent the case to nearby Pima County to avoid a conflict since county officials were named. A judge in Tucson has not yet set a hearing schedule. The lawsuit seeks an order halting a full hand count of early ballots. While the state’s Republican attorney general has sanctioned the hand-count, the state’s Democratic secretary of state has stressed that it is illegal.</p>

Williams on refused to issue a preliminary injunction, saying the Democratic Party and two individual plaintiffs “had not met their burden to establish a substantial threat of actual and imminent irreparable injury.” The lawsuit, filed Oct. 17, alleges that the new law could prevent volunteer observers from sharing information from canvassing-board meetings. It contends the law violates First Amendment and due-process rights. But on Oct. 20, the Florida Division of Elections submitted an advisory opinion about the law that Williams said defined “certain statutory phrases in a manner that assuages the court’s initial concerns that the statute might unconscionably criminalize the release of information obtained at a public canvassing board meeting or severely limit the ability of authorized designees to report canvassing irregularities to their principal candidates, parties or committees.” The lawsuit centers on a change that said any elections official “or other person authorized to observe, review, or inspect ballot materials or observe canvassing who releases any information about votes cast for or against any candidate or ballot measure or any the results of any election” before polls close commits a third-degree felony. The lawsuit contends the change is vague and “chills core First Amendment activity” of observers who report back to political parties or other organizations about actions taken by canvassing boards. “Plaintiffs’ broader construction of the statute would … prohibit attendees at canvassing board meetings open to the public from releasing information obtained during the meeting, a particularly untenable result,” she wrote in the 14-page decision. “Defendants’ narrower construction — that the statute shields a discrete ‘category of sensitive electoral information directly bearing on election results from being released to the public by a narrow subset of individuals who have special authorization to obtain such information’ — is more reasonable and readily apparent.”</p>

The lawsuit filed in federal court said that Mark Andrews faced threats of violence and lives in fear since he was included in the movie without his knowledge or permission. The movie shows Andrews, with his face blurred, as he deposits five ballots for himself and his family into a drop box before the 2020 presidential election. As the video rolls, D’Souza says: “What you are seeing is a crime. These are fraudulent votes.” A state investigation found that Andrews followed Georgia law when he delivered ballots for his three adult children, his wife and himself. State law allows voters, family members or caregivers of disabled voters to drop off ballots. The State Election Board dismissed a complaint against Andrews in May. “Defendants knew that their portrayals of Mr. Andrews were lies, as was the entire narrative of ‘2000 Mules,’ ” the lawsuit states. “But they have continued to peddle these lies in order to enrich themselves. As of the filing of this lawsuit, defendants’ social media accounts and website still promote the film using Mr. Andrews as an example of a criminal ‘mule.’ ”</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell<a href="https://www.whec.com/national-world/judge-wont-dismiss-election-workers-suit-against-giuliani/"> declined to dismiss a defamation lawsuit</a> filed against former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani by two women who served as election workers in Georgia in November 2020. In the lawsuit filed last December, Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss accused Giuliani of defaming them by falsely stating that the pair had engaged in election fraud while counting ballots at State Farm Arena in Atlanta. The lawsuit says Giuliani repeatedly pushed debunked claims that the mother-and-daughter pair pulled out suitcases of illegal ballots and committed other acts of fraud to try to alter the outcome of the presidential election in Georgia.  In an<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.238720/gov.uscourts.dcd.238720.31.0.pdf"> opinion</a> accompanying the<a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/doc1/04519557493"> order</a>, Howell described the situation that followed the November 2020 election, when the vote totals in several key states were so close that the results were not immediately clear. “As election workers across the state worked long hours carefully ensuring the accuracy of the election, the Trump Campaign and its allies, including Giuliani, engaged in a media offensive that at best questioned, and at worse condemned, their work,” Howell wrote.</p>

The lawsuit, led by four-term U.S. Rep. Mike Bost of Murphysboro echoes some of the rejected court challenges filed by former President Donald Trump in other states in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election that he falsely contends was stolen. Bost is being assisted in the suit by a nonprofit conservative advocacy organization that has backed a number of Trump’s efforts. At issue is a 2015 state law that allows vote-by-mail ballots to be counted if they are received within 14 days after Election Day if they were postmarked on or before the final day of voting. If the ballots lack a postmark or if it is illegible, ballots can be counted if the voter dated and signed the ballot on or before Election Day. Election Day is Nov. 8 and the 14-day time period, in which provisional votes also are considered, ends Nov. 22. The suit seeks to have no vote-by-mail ballots counted that are received after Nov. 8. The lawsuit contends the Illinois law violates federal law that establishes the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of even-numbered years as Election Day for federal elections. The suit further contends that the Illinois law subjects Bost to harm, including expenses for post-Election Day poll watchers and the possibility mail-in ballots counted during the 14-day period “dilutes” “timely” votes cast up to and including Election Day.</p>

Approximately 3,200 mail-in ballots sent to Dennis voters in the first two weeks of October incorrectly labeled Democrat challenger Christopher Flanagan as the candidate for reelection, when none in the three-way race are incumbents. Dennis Town Clerk Theresa Bunce was able to intercept approximately 600 of the erroneous ballots. A second, corrected ballot was sent to the voters who received the original, incorrect ballot, alongside a letter alerting voters to the mistake. Voters were given the option to send in the second corrected ballot, she added, but if they had already mailed in the first ballot and did not mail in the second ballot, the original ballot would be counted. On Oct. 18, Post filed a complaint in Barnstable Superior Court, alleging the original ballots were defective and counting them would be a violation of election law. Barnstable Superior Court Judge Mark Gildea heard the complaint on Oct. 20, and the next day denied the injunction sought by Post on the grounds that Galvin and Dennis town clerk offices acted promptly on the error, and there is no evidence the mistake would impact Post’s chances in the polls. A state Appeals Court<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/11/01/metro/state-judge-weighs-appeal-cape-cod-ballot-case/"> denied the appeal</a>. In denying the appeal, Justice Gregory I. Massing<a href="https://www.ma-appellatecourts.org/docket/2022-J-0607"> wrote</a> that state and local election officials have taken appropriate steps to protect candidates, particularly if there is a post-election challenge.</p>

While the lawsuit takes issue with election procedures in place across the state — such as the process for verifying voter signatures on absentee ballots — its allegations of election law violations target Detroit, Michigan&#8217;s largest voting jurisdiction and the nation&#8217;s largest majority-Black city. The lawsuit, filed against Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 midterm election, asks the court to require Detroit voters to cast their ballots in person or show an ID at the clerk&#8217;s office to vote absentee. Currently, election officials rely on signature verification rather than photo identification to verify absentee ballots, and the right to vote absentee is guaranteed in the state constitution. The lawsuit suggests election officials should toss those ballots. It asks the court to &#8220;halt the use of absentee ballots that are obtained without identification&#8221; and &#8220;the counting of ballots cast through drop boxes that are not effectively monitored,&#8221; citing the widely debunked 2,000 Mules film by a far-right provocateur purportedly showing illegal votes returned via drop boxes election experts say provides no evidence of widespread fraud. The lawsuit from Karamo doesn&#8217;t indicate how voters who have already returned their absentee ballots might ensure their votes count. Karamo and other individuals suing Detroit&#8217;s city clerk to stop mail-in voting<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/michigan/2022/10/31/kristina-karamo-abandons-bid-bench-58-judges-in-detroit-mail-absentee-voting-lawsuit/69605940007/"> agreed to withdraw their motion to disqualify Wayne County&#8217;s 58 circuit judges</a> from hearing the case at the conclusion of a fiery hour-long hearing over the matter. Attorney Daniel Hartman, who is representing Karamo and others who filed the suit, said he would agree to withdraw the motion for disqualification since Chief Judge Timothy Kenny would be hearing the case and wasn&#8217;t up for re-election.</p>
<p>7th Circuit Court for Genesee County  Judge Mark Latchana dismissed a Republican lawsuit seeking a court ruling ordering Flint election officials to<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/02/gop-lawsuit-over-flint-election-worker-hiring-dismissed/69614548007/"> hire additional GOP election workers</a> for the upcoming Nov. 8 midterm. The Michigan GOP and Republican National Committee filed the legal challenge last Friday, alleging that Flint election administrators violated Michigan election law requiring them to strive for an equal representation of Democrats and Republicans among their election inspector workforce. Election inspectors in Michigan staff polling locations and counting boards that process absentee ballots. Latchana dismissed the lawsuit because he found that the Republican parties lacked standing to bring it, according to the Michigan GOP. Flint city attorney Bill Kim welcomed the judge’s decision to dismiss the lawsuit. “We really viewed this lawsuit as political theater and an attempt to disrupt our elections,” he said. He said that the city clerk’s office has tried to achieve partisan balance in the make-up of election workers who will help administer the midterm in the city.</p>

The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office has gotten involved and is joining the county in asking a judge to dismiss the lawsuit. Judge Carol Hanks indicated during a hearing she is unlikely to issue any ruling before Election Day. The lawsuit was filed in August in Rice County District Court against Denise Anderson, Rice County’s elections director. It was filed by Kathleen Hagen, who is a Lonsdale resident and a former election judge, and Matt Benda, an attorney from Albert Lea who was a Republican candidate for Congress. The lawsuit initially sought to force the county to release more documents about its elections equipment. The plaintiffs later expanded the scope of the lawsuit, asking Hanks to issue an order prohibiting the county from using modems to transmit election results to the Secretary of State. The modems are a threat to election integrity, Benda argues.</p>

If successful, the lawsuit could grant voting rights to thousands of people permanently banned from casting ballots as a result of felony convictions. “At a time when our state and nation are struggling with the vestiges of a history of racism, it is important that the United States Supreme Court step in to address this remaining vestige of the malicious 1890 plan to prevent an entire race of people from voting in Mississippi,” said Rob McDuff, the attorney who brought the lawsuit for the Mississippi Center for Justice. Section 241 of the Mississippi Constitution strips voting rights from people convicted of 10 felonies, including forgery, arson and bigamy. The state attorney general issued an opinion in 2009 that expanded the list to 22 crimes, including timber larceny, carjacking, felony-level shoplifting and felony-level bad check writing. Attorneys who challenged the provision had argued the authors of the state’s Jim Crow-era constitution showed racist intent when they chose which felonies would cause people to lose the right to vote, picking crimes they thought were more likely to be committed by Black people. The lawsuit dates back to 2017. In a news release, MCJ said it filed the suit on behalf of two Black men — Roy Harness and Kamal Karriem. Harness is a military veteran who was convicted of forgery in 1986 and Karriem is a former Columbus city council member who was convicted of embezzlement in 2005, the organization said. Both men served their sentences but still cannot vote.</p>

Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, who is in charge of elections and has been one of the GOP’s most vocal critics of the sort of voter-fraud conspiracy theories that fueled the hand tallying of ballots, said the “hand-counting process must cease immediately.” She requested in a letter to Nye County Clerk Mark Kampf that he confirm to her office Thursday night that the hand count process “had been stopped.” In its three-page ruling, the high court stopped short of ordering a halt to the recount. But the court sided with the arguments the ACLU made in an emergency motion. The ACLU accused Nye County officials of violating a Supreme Court order issued last week requiring the count to be conducted in a way that prevents public release of early results before polls close to in-person voting Nov. 8. The ACLU argued that reading candidates’ names aloud from ballots within hearing distance of public observers violates the court rule. The high court said the “specifics of the hand-count process and ”observer positioning” in a way that comply with its earlier order was for Nye County and the secretary of state “to determine.”</p>

A Clark County District Court judge is scheduled on Wednesday to consider accusations that county elections chief Joe Gloria “stacked” a key ballot signature verification board with 23 Democrats, 33 nonpartisans and “a mere” eight Republicans.</p>

The decision from the Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court reverses a lower court ruling that declared New York&#8217;s early review of absentee ballots unconstitutional. The appeals court said Republican and Conservative party officials who challenged the law waited too long. The court also upheld a pandemic-era law that allows voters worried about becoming ill to vote by absentee. “In our view, granting petitioners the requested relief during an ongoing election would be extremely disruptive and profoundly destabilizing and prejudicial to candidates, voters and the State and local Boards of Elections,” read a decision from the court. Changing the absentee ballot rules now would mean voters would be treated differently during this election depending on when they returned their ballots, the court said. “We should be taking every step possible to empower voters and ease New Yorkers’ access to the polls,” state Attorney General Letitia James said in a prepared release. “I was proud to defend New York’s absentee ballot reforms, and am happy with the decision to keep these commonsense election integrity initiatives in place.” It was not clear if the plaintiffs would try to appeal to the state&#8217;s highest court.</p>

The order came as the result of a 3-3 deadlock on the court over whether rejecting such ballots — which have been at the center of an ongoing political and legal fight between Democrats and Republicans — violates federal civil rights law. Three of the justices said throwing out the ballots of otherwise qualified voters over a missing or incorrect date would improperly exclude legal votes. Three others disagreed. The seventh spot on the court remains vacant after the death of former Chief Justice Max Baer. “We hereby direct that the Pennsylvania county boards of elections segregate and preserve any ballots contained in undated or incorrectly dated outer envelopes,” the court said in its brief order, which was not immediately accompanied by any opinions explaining the justices’ reasoning. The order said only that opinions would be released later.</p>

The 13 plaintiffs in the case, who are driven by the disproven theory that the 2020 election was stolen, say Clackamas, Washington, Multnomah, Lane, Linn, Marion, Jackson, Deschutes, Yamhill, Douglas, Klamath and Coos counties and Fagan fueled “a profound crisis of confidence that constitutes de facto voter suppression and disenfranchisement,” in a suit filed in the U.S. District Court in Portland. “It’s kind of a kitchen sink case,” said Ben Morris with the Secretary of State’s office. “They’re throwing everything they can at us. All kinds of different things, including several arguments about things that don’t involve Oregon.” The plaintiffs are asking each county to allow third-party experts to take three “forensic images” of ballot tabulating software throughout the Nov. 8 general election process. But election officials aren’t sure what exactly that means because the plaintiffs failed to define “forensic images” in the suit. To give the plaintiffs what they want would go against existing Oregon law and would compromise the security of the election, said David Doyle, Deschutes County’s legal counsel. Both the Secretary of State’s office and Doyle expect to oppose the suit and deny the request for “forensic images.” They plan to make a joint response to the lawsuit on Monday. Thielman said the plaintiffs intend to appeal if their request is denied.</p>

The city of Peñitas was granted a temporary restraining order against Hidalgo County last week in response to the county removing the Peñitas Public Library as a polling location. The county previously said it didn’t receive a request to use the library as a polling location until after the deadline to submit applications had passed. Hidalgo County Precinct 3 Commissioner Everardo “Ever” Villarreal also cited accessibility, traffic flow, and general safety concerns. Under the TRO, the county was barred from holding early voting if the library was not reinstated as a polling location. The county filed an appeal that put the judge’s order on hold. In its Thursday ruling, the 13th Court of Appeals declared that the TRO was “void and had no effect.”  “The court did not rule on whether the city’s lawsuit was valid,” the city of Peñitas said in a news release. “The city of Peñitas will use all legal remedies and the district court to obtain answers for all voters in Hidalgo County, and to prevent the overreaching actions of Hidalgo County Commissioners Court, The Hidalgo County Elections Department and Commissioner Everardo Villarreal in the future.”</p>

In a complaint filed Nov. 1, two Loudoun residents — Thomas Kasperek, of Sterling, and Richard Ryan, of Ashburn — allege that the electronic voting machines used in the 2020 and 2021 general elections are made by Chinese manufacturers “who are known to insert backdoors, allowing nefarious actors access to the equipment to manipulate data.” They are asking the court to disqualify all electronic voting systems in Loudoun County “in favor of voter-verified, hand counts of all physical ballots cast” until a ruling is handed down on their use. The Loudoun lawsuit is primarily aimed at the county’s top election officers — General Registrar Judy Brown and Deputy Registrar Richard Keech — and its three Electoral Board members — two Democrats and one Republican — who the complaint said are “complicit in the approval of illegally certified voting equipment,” despite being allegedly aware of their vulnerability to security breaches. Kasperek and Ryan further claim that the actions by these five individuals shows “intentional and unintentional cooperation with nefarious actors to alter the results of 2020 and 2021.” As evidence, the two point to a U.S. Homeland Security Department circular dated June 3, 2022, that said 32 of 133 precincts in Virginia were using a ballot scanning software that could be breached in nine ways.</p>

The 2nd District Court of Appeals decided against hearing an appeal of a Waukesha County circuit court judge’s ruling this month in favor of a conservative group founded by prominent Republicans. That ruling required the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission to rescind its guidance that allowed the spoiling of ballots that had already been cast. Voters who obtained an absentee ballot, but have not yet voted and want to obtain a new one, can still do that. The elections commission held an emergency meeting Friday, less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, and unanimously voted to rescind the guidance issued in August detailing how an already cast ballot could be spoiled. Very few voters have actually spoiled their absentee ballots after voting in recent elections, data provided by the elections commission to The Associated Press shows. In the August primary, just 3,519 people cast a new ballot after spoiling their original one, less than 0.3% of all votes cast, the data shows. The appeals court on Oct. 10 agreed to put the lower court’s ruling on hold while it decided whether to hear the appeal from the elections commission, the Democratic National Committee and Rise, Inc., a group that works to get college students to vote. “The court’s order does not change what is on the ballot. Nor does it prevent a single voter—Democrat, Republican, or otherwise—from casting a ballot in the upcoming election,” the appeals court said. “Thus, claims of confusion and disenfranchisement ring hollow.”</p>
<p>The City of Green Bay<a href="https://www.wbay.com/2022/11/02/lawsuit-alleges-green-bay-city-clerk-restricting-access-poll-watchers/"> implemented changes to give poll watchers more access</a> during the in-person absentee voting process. A temporary injunction was ordered in Brown County Court Wednesday in response to a lawsuit filed against City Clerk Celestine Jeffreys alleging she is restricting access to election observers. The plaintiffs listed are Nathan DeLorey, Randy Wery, Patricia Schick, and Denise Vetter. This lawsuit comes less than one week before the Nov. 8 election. The suit claims Jeffreys has been “prohibiting members of the public from observing all aspects of the in-person absentee ballot voting process that has been underway since October 25, 2022 at the office of the City Clerk for the City of Green Bay.” The suit sought a temporary restraining order and injunction from “prohibiting her from violating<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/7/i/41"> Wis. Stat. § 7.41</a>, which requires that municipal clerks allow the public to observe all public aspects of the in-person absentee ballot voting process, and an order and a declaratory judgment regarding the proper construction of the Wisconsin Statutes requiring that the public be afforded the ability to observe all public aspects of the in-person absentee ballot voting process.” The city created a spot for election observers &#8212; and the first person to sit in the newly designated space was one of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.</p>
<p>Paul Buzzell, 52, of Mequon has been charged with a felony that carries possible incarceration if he’s convicted in what a prosecutor calls a “test case.” According to a criminal complaint, Buzzell, a Mequon-Thiensville School Board member,<a href="https://www.wizmnews.com/2022/10/31/facebook-photo-of-marked-ballot-results-in-felony-charge-for-wisconsin-man/"> posted a photo of his completed April ballot on his Facebook page</a>. It resulted in a voter fraud charge that includes a maximum 3 ½ years behind bars and up to $10,000 in fines upon conviction. Wisconsin law says it’s illegal for anyone to show a marked ballot to anyone else or to place a mark on a ballot that identifies it as that person’s ballot. The state Senate in 2020 passed a bill to legalize the taking of so-called ballot selfies, but it died in the Assembly. County election clerks opposed changing the law, saying the ban is intended to protect ballot secrecy. Ozaukee County District Attorney Adam Gerol, a Republican, says he is trying to use the criminal complaint to resolve an issue. “You could say it’s a test case,” Gerol said. “The best thing that could come of this would be an appellate decision as to whether it violates the First Amendment or not.”</p>
