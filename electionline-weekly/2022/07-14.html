							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>GAO releases new report on 2020 election</strong><br />
<em>GAO received survey responses from 43 states and 407 local jurisdictions.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8593" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-14-at-11.06.32-AM.png" alt="" width="274" height="104" />This week, the<a href="https://www.gao.gov/"> U.S. Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO) released a<a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-104731.pdf"> new report</a> on the 2020 election. GAO&#8217;s mission is to provide Congress with fact-based, nonpartisan information that can help improve federal government performance and ensure accountability for the benefit of the American people.</p>
<p>Election officials faced unprecedented challenges in conducting the 2020 elections during the COVID-19 pandemic. The<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/coronavirus/about-the-cares-act"> CARES Act</a> provided $400 million in grants for states to use to prevent, prepare for, and respond to issues related to the pandemic for the 2020 federal election cycle.<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> The U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> (EAC) was responsible for administering the grants. In addition, the EAC serves as a national clearinghouse and resource for the compilation of information and review of procedures with respect to the administration of federal elections.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7615" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The CARES Act includes a provision for GAO to report on its ongoing monitoring and oversight efforts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This report describes (1) the steps states and local jurisdictions took to prepare for and conduct elections in 2020 during the pandemic and the challenges they reported facing, (2) how states and local jurisdictions reported using CARES Act grant funding, and the challenges they reported facing, and (3) what EAC resources and guidance states and local jurisdictions used and their perspectives on such assistance.</p>
<p>To address all three objectives, GAO conducted two web-based surveys of election officials. One survey was administered to election offices in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and achieved a response rate of 84 percent. The other survey was administered to a sample of 829 local election jurisdictions. The survey achieved a weighted response rate of 47 percent, and the design and analysis allows GAO to provide national estimates of the perspectives of local election officials.</p>
<p>GAO surveyed state election offices and local election jurisdictions about steps they took to prepare for and conduct the 2020 elections during the pandemic. The surveys asked questions on steps and challenges in five areas: absentee/mail voting, in-person voting, election supplies, election worker recruitment and training, and voter education and outreach. GAO received survey responses from 43 states and 407 local jurisdictions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6163" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EarlyVoting-300x197.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EarlyVoting-300x197.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EarlyVoting.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Within the area of in-person voting, for example, nearly all states reported taking steps to coordinate with public health agencies, and most coordinated with emergency management agencies, consulted with vendors and experts, and helped local election offices add new polling locations. Nearly all local jurisdictions reported taking steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as by providing protective equipment to election workers.</p>
<p>States and local jurisdictions most commonly reported that various issues related to in-person voting—such as funding and understanding guidance—were not challenging. For voter education and outreach, all states reported that they provided information on their elections websites about voting policies and procedures. Nearly all local jurisdictions reported that they answered questions about voting policies and procedures. Additionally, nearly all states and most local jurisdictions reported that false or misleading information about absentee/mail voting was challenging.</p>
<p>Over half of states reported spending CARES Act grants on supplies and equipment, voter education, facilitating absentee/mail voting, and recruiting and training election workers. Most states reported that issues related to grant funding and reporting requirements were challenging, such as submitting required progress reports within 20 days of an election. More than half of local jurisdictions reported spending CARES Act grants on various in-person voting activities, including purchasing protective supplies and cleaning voting locations.</p>
<p>Nearly all states and some local jurisdictions reported that they used EAC information resources and guidance during the pandemic. Nearly all states used information about CARES Act grants; fewer used information on other election administration topics. Most states reported finding EAC&#8217;s information helpful during the 2020 elections. Most local jurisdictions reported that they did not use EAC information on any of the topics GAO asked about, such as in-person voting. The most common reasons cited were that they were not aware of or did not need the information.</p>

<p>Center for Election Innovation and Research and the Civic Alliance, the cohort surveyed voters, local election officials, and team representatives from cities across the country – including Baltimore, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Washington, D.C., Louisville, Tampa, Indianapolis, Phoenix, Boston, Green Bay, Cleveland, and Charlotte – where major league sports teams converted stadiums into polling sites in the 2020 election. Virtually all stakeholders involved expressed praise for the initiative, indicating great potential for efforts to be replicated and built upon in future elections.</p>
<p>In the 2020 election, there was a reckoning on the sports world to respond to the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and support social justice by encouraging civic engagement. Teams rose to the occasion by offering up their facilities as safe, socially-distant, and accessible polling sites. Civic Responsibility Project—a cohort of nonprofits, brands, and influencers working to shift the culture around civic engagement and strengthen our democracy—supported research to explore the impact of this unprecedented response.</p>
<p>The 2020 election produced the highest voter turnout in over a century and shifted the conversation around corporate involvement in civic engagement,” said Ashley Spillane, Co-Founder of the Civic Responsibility Project. !The near-unanimous praise for stadium polling across party lines is an encouraging indication of the potential such collaborative efforts have to build on the momentum of the last election and drive participation in the midterms.”</p>
<p>The report offers five case studies with teams in Atlanta, Charlotte, Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Washington, D.C. Overall, the interviews reflect a new attitude of sports franchises towards civic engagement, widespread support from local election officials, and optimism on both ends to collaborate on future civic activities. The positive feedback is attributed to a range of factors including the size of facilities, which allows for shorter waiting times and increased safety, available parking, and disability access. The impact on vote times was particularly dramatic in several locations: voters waited an average of 26 minutes to vote at the Atlanta Hawks&#8217; State Farm Arena in 2020, while the average wait time in some places in the county was 4 hours.</p>
<p>Teams also cited ease in organizing logistics due to similarities in processes for games and concerts.</p>
<p>“The partnership with the teams was a great thing for our city and our county,&#8221; said Michael Dickerson, Director of Elections, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (Charlotte). “This was the most powerful thing I have ever been associated with,” said Steve Koonin, CEO of the Atlanta Hawks &amp; State Farm Arena.</p>
<p>“The key to success here was the relationships built between the local election officials and team representatives that honored and uplifted each of their areas of expertise,” said Natalie Tran, Co-Founder of the Civic Alliance and Executive Director of the CAA Foundation. “These findings demonstrate the power businesses have to support our democratic process through meaningful partnerships that emphasize mutual respect and clear communication. We’re proud to see the impact Civic Alliance member companies like these are making in their communities, and we’re excited to apply these learnings to future collaborations with our corporate partners.”</p>
<p>In addition, an online survey of a representative sample of adults in the U.S. was conducted to understand citizens’ thoughts on stadium voting. Results showed broad support across the political spectrum. When asked whether they support or oppose using sports stadiums as polling places for voting, 77% of respondents !Strongly” or !Somewhat” supported voting at stadiums. Democrats offer the strongest base of support with 36% !Strongly” supporting and 50% “Somewhat” supporting. Republican and politically unaffiliated respondents echoed that sentiment with a clear majority “Strongly” or “Somewhat” supporting—66% for Republicans and 71% for unaffiliated.</p>
<p>A core component of this research was also to understand who voted at stadiums and why, which presented a challenge due to the lack of available data in most counties. However, three jurisdictions—Los Angeles County, California, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C.—provided viable, comparative data. A key finding was the variability across jurisdictions and stadiums with regard to the composition of voters. Despite preconceptions among some that non-white or Democratic voters would take greater advantage of stadium voting, the data do not show a consistent difference in Democratic turnout and Republican turnout at stadium polling sites. No single demographic or partisan group consistently benefited from or took advantage of stadium voting.</p>
<p>The report wraps with a breakdown of lessons learned to inform and improve future stadium voting initiatives. Highlights include an emphasis on cultivating strong relationships between teams and local election officials, strong outreach and education efforts, and a call for teams and leagues to tap into their potential to do more to elicit impact.</p>

While a<a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article263284463.html"> 21-day deadline is pretty typical</a>, it also meant that voter registration was shut down for residents who wanted to register for the upcoming August 2 primary. The ACLU threatened to sue the county, but the secretary of state’s office stepped in to ensure that registration was reopened. Clay Barker, deputy assistant Kansas secretary of state, told the ACLU of Kansas on Friday morning he spoke with Phillips and that registration would be reopened. “They will reach out to everyone who tried to register as new voter and ask them to either return to register, if they had been turned away, or that their registration form will be processed,” Barker wrote in an email to ACLU of Kansas legal director Sharon Brett. Whitney Tempel, a spokeswoman for Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, said his office will try to address the conflict between state and federal law during the next legislative session. Some local residents had urged the City of Atchison to cancel or postpone the election, but local officials refused.</p>

State Archivist Brian Burford is busy preserving ballots from elections dating back to 1892.  “They’re very expensive to preserve,” Burford told the paper. “We’ve done 1892 and 1986 and now we’ve done the 1900 election.” In the conservation process, fasteners are removed and ballots are cleaned. After tears in the paper are repaired, each ballot is washed in a special solution to neutralize the acid and then placed in an archival plastic sleeve to support the paper’s fibers. Up through the late 1800s paper was made from old rags and cotton, a technology that can last for centuries, but then it was found how to make paper out of wood pulp, the method still in use today. The old preserved ballots can be seen by request, he said: “I’ve got them put away in a cooler in a dark vault, but anybody who’d like to see them can ask and I’d be happy to bring them out.” Midland County,<a href="https://www.cbs7.com/2022/07/08/midland-county-election-records-over-century-ago-preserved/"> Texas</a> Elections Administrator Carolyn Graves is also hard at work preserving elections records dating back to 1886 in that county. Graves, says she loves collecting old books, so the preservation of election records started as a passion project for her. Graves says her predecessor had rescued the records from a barn and then she took the next step to keep them safe forever. The records are now kept in protective plastic seals which took a year to complete because the process required going through the returns page by page. “It’s interesting because you can look back and see when Bush first ran for office. He lost that first time. You can go back and see and it’s really interesting that there was more than just the republican and democrat party. It was history,” said Graves.</p>

The sticker reads “I voted!” in English, “A:ñi ‘ant wodalt” in Tohono O’odham and “Yo Voté” in Spanish. The Tohono O’odham language was included to acknowledge that Pima County is within the ancestral homelands of the Tohono O’odham Nation and nearly 42% of the county’s land includes the Tohono O’odham and Pascua Yaqui tribes. “Pima” is an O’odham word for another tribe, and “Arizona” is derived from the O’odham word “Alṣon,” meaning “place of little springs.” Tucson is derived from the O’odham phrase “S-cuk ṣon,” or “base of the black mountain.” The Pima County Recorder’s Officer also plans to release the sticker in the Yoeme or Yaqui language. Recorder Gabriella Cázares-Kelly is a member of the Tohono O’odham Nation and the first Native American to hold a countywide elected office in Pima County.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) has introduced legislation (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4500/text">S 4500</a>) would<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-launches-plan-more-071952087.html"> expand voter registration at public colleges and universities</a>, ensure all states allow 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote, require colleges and universities to have polling places on campus and ensure that all states include student IDs as a form of voter ID, among other proposals. The bill is based on expanding implementation for the 26th Amendment, which was ratified in 1971 and established the right of individuals aged 18 and older to vote. Previously, all voters needed to be at least 21 years old. Rep. Nikema Williams (D-GA), who leads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s voter protection efforts, is sponsoring the bill in the House. Warren’s bill, as it stands, is co-sponsored by six additional Democrats in the Senate, but no Republicans. “Voting is the beating heart of our democracy. Young people are the future of America, and with voting rights under attack across the country, we must do everything we can to ensure they can exercise their right to vote,” Warren wrote in a statement. “My new bicameral bill with Congresswoman Williams will ensure young people aren’t left out of the voting process, and I’m thrilled to partner with her and my colleagues on this effort.”</p>

Doug Mastriano of Franklin County, would give candidates the right to have an additional observer and post them inside, close enough to see any canvassing and pre-canvassing. Gov. Wolf says the bill “undermines the integrity of our election process and encourages voter intimidation.” Wolf added he believes the bill would’ve made it possible for “bad faith partisan operatives to target a specific neighborhood or group of voters in an attempt to challenge the eligibility of voters, make poll workers’ jobs more difficult, and disrupt the counting of ballots.” The governor says he “urges” the General Assembly to focus on election reform that allows for free and safe elections.</p>
<p>In other legislation news. Wolf has signed House Bill 1614 into law. Under the new law, voting precincts in Pennsylvania will now be<a href="https://www.yourerie.com/news/pennsylvania-news/gov-wolf-signs-new-election-ballot-printing-law/"> required to print a certain number of ballots</a> on Election Day. Sponsored by Rep. Ryan Warner (R-Fayette/Westmoreland) requires a voting precinct to print 50% of the necessary ballots needed based on the number of people registered to vote. For a general election, precincts will need to print a ballot for every person registered to vote in that precinct. Precincts can skip printing ballots for the number of people who requested an absentee or mail-in ballot. The bill amends the Pennsylvania Election Code and will take effect in 60 days. The law comes after reports of precincts running out of ballots after under printing leading up to Election Day.</p>
<p>With the approval of this year’s state budget package Wolf and state lawmakers agreed to ban private election<a href="https://www.cityandstatepa.com/policy/2022/07/new-state-budget-brings-changes-pennsylvanias-election-laws/374206/"> funding</a>, meaning state and local governments can no longer accept third-party grants to fund elections. Instead, the budget deal includes a new $45 million state grant program designed to help counties with election-related costs. Under the agreement, which was outlined in<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=0982"> Senate Bill 982</a>, counties will be able to apply for state grants distributed by the Department of Community and Economic Development for a range of uses, including: Payment of staff to pre-canvass and canvass ballots; Security and transparency expenses related to pre-canvassing and canvassing ballots; Voter registration list maintenance; Ballot printing costs; Training costs for district election officials; Payment of staff at polling places; Costs related to storage, transportation and preparation of voting machines and other polling place materials and County voter registration costs.</p>

Dominion filed to subpoena Donald Trump&#8217;s former AG last week, according to the docket &#8212; the latest sign that the company&#8217;s lawsuits against those who pushed false claims of election fraud may be gathering steam. As part of the Fox News suit, Dominion recently issued an additional string of subpoenas to officials including Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who Trump famously called after the 2020 election asking to help him &#8220;find&#8221; the exact number of votes he needed to win the state of Georgia. In its $1.6 billion defamation suit filed against Fox News last March, Dominion alleges that the network pushed false accusations that the voting company had rigged the 2020 election in order to make a profit and boost ratings. &#8220;Fox sold a false story of election fraud in order to serve its own commercial purposes, severely injuring Dominion in the process,&#8221; Dominion said in its complaint.</p>

The justices have scheduled oral arguments for Oct. 4 on the question of whether the state’s map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting procedures that discriminate on the basis of race. A three-judge court ruled in January that Alabama’s district map likely violated the act. The judges issued an injunction against using the map in this year’s elections and ordered the Legislature to draw a new one. But in February, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the state’s request for a stay, temporarily blocking the injunction. That allowed the map to be used in this year’s congressional races. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in an opinion granting the stay that the decision was based on the timing. The three-judge court’s order came four months before the May 24 primary. “The stay order is not a ruling on the merits, but instead simply stays the District Court’s injunction pending a ruling on the merits,” Kavanaugh wrote.</p>

Those charges are similar to those included in a 13-count grand jury indictment against Peters and her chief deputy, Belinda Knisley. In an affidavit in support of Brown’s arrest first obtained by The Daily Sentinel, a longtime investigator with the Mesa County District Attorney’s Office, James Cannon, wrote that Brown was involved from the beginning in an alleged scheme to make copies of election software during a routine “trusted build” in May 2021, and allegedly using someone else’s identity to do so. “Brown’s actions, statements and/or inactions were a — successful — attempt to influence the public servant’s decisions and actions before and during the trusted build through Sandra’s misrepresentations,” Cannon added. “Wood no longer is a target of the investigation.

Attorney Vincent Marino, who represents Cohen, said he agrees with Superior Court Judge Robin Wilson’s opinion that there had been violations of election statutes in how the city collected and counted absentee ballots, but he disagreed with the conclusion that only nine ballots were at issue and therefore not enough to require a special election. Mayor Nancy Rossi, the incumbent Democrat, won by 32 votes following a recanvass of the closely-fought 2021 election. Wilson, in her decision, said Cohen’s team proved seven absentee ballots were improperly counted and two ballots marked as returned were unaccounted for — too small of a margin to believe Rossi was not the legitimate victor. However, Marino said the court overlooked several issues, such as 14 ballots that were counted but not properly endorsed and eight additional ballots that lacked documentation for how they were returned to the city clerk’s office. Marino also argued that the city acted outside of Secretary of the State guidance by having employees in the city clerk’s office collect absentee ballots from three dropboxes instead of having the city clerk do it herself.</p>

Boulee has denied an attempt by advocacy organizations to throw out a part of Georgia’s voting law that<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-upholds-limits-on-mass-mailings-of-georgia-absentee-ballot-forms/QQATT3XZAJBMBFTQ3KBXYVYMYQ/"> prohibits mailing multiple absentee ballot applications</a> to voters. Boulee’s ruling leaves in place restrictions on sending absentee ballot request forms after voters were swamped with repeated solicitations during the 2020 election year. Some voters complained that they kept receiving letters imploring them to apply for absentee ballots, even after they had already done so. Boulee said groups can still mail absentee ballot applications, but the law prevents them from sending forms to Georgians who have already requested a ballot or voted. “The Georgia Legislature struck a balance. It required third parties to consult the state voter roll and refrain from sending duplicate applications,” Boulee wrote in a June 30 order denying a motion for preliminary injunction. “To be sure, avoiding voter confusion and administering effective elections are important regulatory interests.” Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said the ruling shows that Georgia’s voting law withstands court scrutiny. “This is a huge win for election integrity,” Raffensperger said. “This law has commonsense reforms that will help ensure smooth, secure and accessible elections in Georgia.”</p>

The Massachusetts Republican Party had been challenging the state&#8217;s new law, dubbed the VOTES Act, that allows anyone to vote by mail for any reason.

In a statement, Mass. GOP said they intend to appeal to the Supreme Court because the case &#8220;presented significant issues of both state and federal law.&#8221; “We hope that Supreme Court will provide relief to prevent a constitutional travesty presented by this law,” Mass. GOP chair Jim Lyons said. “Only in Massachusetts can absentee voting possibly be defined as the mailing of 4.7 million ballot applications to every voter in the commonwealth.” Galvin says he’s not concerned about a potential appeal from the state&#8217;s Republican party. “We&#8217;re proceeding immediately,” he said. “They have no injunction against me. They better catch me if they can, because I&#8217;m going to make sure voters have the right to vote [by mail] if they possibly can.”</p>

<p>The Missoula County Election Integrity Project and John Lott, Ph.D. have filed a lawsuit in Missoula District Court against the<a href="https://newstalkkgvo.com/election-integrity-lawsuit-filed-against-missoula-county-office/"> Missoula County Elections Office</a> and Bradley Seaman in his official capacity as Elections Administrator. The gist of the lawsuit ‘enjoins Defendants from their systematic practice of destroying video, data, and documentary election records. It is, therefore, a request for prospective relief. 2. Upon information and belief, the Missoula Elections Office installed video recording device(s) (hereinafter referred to as the “vote count video”) for the 2020 election cycle in the vote count room to ensure election transparency and public trust in the elections process. In response, KGVO reached out to Missoula County Elections Administrator Bradley Seaman for his comments on the issue. “We can&#8217;t comment on ongoing litigation against the county, but transparency is critically important,” said Seaman. “And that&#8217;s why we maintain a 100 percent transparent process around elections to help educate people on the way elections truly function. That’s why we encourage anybody to come by at any point in time and have held public tours, while we make sure to send out press releases to media outlets like yourself, to candidates to elected officials, and members of the public, so that they can see how elections truly function.”</p>

A disabled person needing help to vote by mail can now seek assistance from anyone they choose, not just from a close relative or legal guardian as state law has limited, the State Board of Elections told county election officials after the decision filed by Boyle. Boyle declared that such restraints in state law conflict with the federal Voting Rights Act, which allows people who are blind, can&#8217;t read or write, or have a disability to pick whomever they wish to assist them with voting, other than the voter&#8217;s employer or union. The elimination of the state&#8217;s restrictions applies to all citizens with such disabilities, and not just the thousands who reside in hospitals, clinics or nursing homes, Boyle ruled in a lawsuit filed last September against the state board by the nonprofit Disability Rights North Carolina.</p>

In a motion filed this week, they asked for an<a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/voter-id-opponents-seek-expedited-n-c-supreme-court-review/"> expedited hearing</a>. “Timely resolution of this matter is necessary to allow the State and its voters to prepare for future elections without the risk of voter confusion and disenfranchisement,” according to the motion from attorney Jeffrey Loperfido of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. The coalition represents plaintiffs challenging the state’s 2018 voter ID law. The case is called Holmes v. Moore. “It has now been more than three years since S.B. 824 [the voter ID law] was enacted,” the motion added. “And the legislature’s inability thus far to craft a voter ID law that does not intentionally discriminate against African American voters has resulted in nearly 10 years of confusing, on-again-off-again messaging to voters and election officials alike. … North Carolina’s voters and election officials deserve the certainty that only this Court’s review can provide.” “[I]n light of the recent release of the Supreme Court’s Calendar of Arguments for August, Plaintiffs-Appellees request that the Court schedule this matter for oral argument at the earliest possible date, either in a special session scheduled for September or, in the alternative, as part of the October oral argument calendar,” Loperfido wrote. The motion acknowledges that legislative leaders oppose an expedited review. State government lawyers representing the N.C. State Board of Elections “take no position” on the motion, according to Loperfido.</p>

Welte’s ruling dismissed the state’s argument that the tribes lacked the standing to sue. Welte, who is based in Fargo, said the state’s argument was without merit and the tribes “do have standing to protect the voting rights of its members.” Secretary of State Al Jaeger said that he would not comment on ongoing litigation. The Legislature approved a map that It separates the state House districts on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation in northern North Dakota and the Fort Berthold reservation, which is home to the Three Affiliated Tribes and in the west of the state. Turtle Mountain argues that the map “packs” tribal members into a single House district on its reservation while diluting their vote with non-native voters in the non-reservation subdistrict.</p>

The Department of State sued Lancaster, Berks and Fayette counties in Commonwealth Court, describing them as “outlier counties” that have not properly certified vote tallies from the May 17 election that included nominating contests for U.S. Senate, governor and most of the Legislature. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled May 20 that mail-in ballots without a required date on the return envelope must be allowed in a 2021 county judge race in Pennsylvania. Although the U.S. Supreme Court declined to halt the Senate vote-counting after the primary, three justices signed onto an opinion that said the 3rd Circuit was “very likely wrong.” In the new case, the Department of State and acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman under Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf want an order forcing the three counties to include in their primary election tallies, within three days, all absentee and mail-in voters, “even if the voter failed to write a date on the declaration printed on the ballot&#8217;s return envelope.&#8221; “Interpreting Pennsylvania law to allow a county board of election to exclude a ballot from its final certified results because of a minor and meaningless irregularity, such as a voter omitting a date from the declaration on a timely received ballot, would fail to fulfill the purpose of the Pennsylvania Election Code and would risk a conflict with both the Pennsylvania Constitution and federal law,” wrote the state agency&#8217;s lawyers from the attorney general&#8217;s office.</p>

The ruling did not address whether someone must physically put their own absentee ballot in the mailbox if voting by mail.  In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ann Walsh Bradley (no relation to her colleague) wrote that the court&#8217;s decision &#8220;although lamentable, is not a surprise.&#8221; &#8220;It has seemingly taken the opportunity to make it harder to vote or to inject confusion into the process whenever it has been presented with the opportunity,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;Without justification, [the majority] fans the flames of electoral doubt that threaten our democracy.&#8221;</p>
