<p>“The Clearies give the EAC an opportunity to recognize the hard work and dedication of election officials across the country,” said EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks. “The recipients of these awards should be incredibly proud of the work they did, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Their innovative thinking, resourcefulness, and creativity are now a tentpole for other election administrators to follow and build on.”</p>
<p>EAC Commissioner and 2021 EAC Chairman, Donald Palmer said, “Election officials showed us once again that they are true civic leaders in their communities. The professionalism and sense of purpose they displayed ensured that millions of voters across the U.S. were able to cast their ballots securely and accurately. In the face of unprecedented scrutiny, it is an honor to be able to highlight their innovative work.”</p>
<p>Now in its sixth year, the Clearie Awards recognize the innovative efforts of election officials across America. Entries were judged based on each initiative’s depiction of positive results, innovation, sustainability, outreach efforts, cost-effectiveness, and replicability.</p>

Elections in the United States are chronically—and, in some cases, hazardously—underfunded. The majority of existing funding comes from state and local sources, with only intermittent, discretionary federal appropriations. Inadequate funding leads to antiquated technology and equipment, understaffed election offices, and overworked officials. The 2020 election exposed this reality. . Recent federal appropriations for election security have incentivized states to make investments in their elections processes; however, relying on one-off discretionary “money drops” of varying amounts is an inefficient and inadequate way to provide funding when election officials need consistency and predictability. The big idea of this paper is that the Presidential Election Campaign Fund (currently containing $400 million) should be reimagined as a funding source for state and local election administration, filling crucial funding gaps and strengthening American democracy</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7443" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Defend Democracy</strong>: A Democratic candidate recruiting group is pitching donors on an ambitious three-year program to<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/18/democrats-recruiting-push-local-election-officers-00025733"> find, train and support 5,000 candidates for local offices in charge of election administration</a>. The program would recruit candidates in 35 states for everything from county probate judges in Alabama to county clerks in Kansas and county election board members in Pennsylvania — all offices that handle elections and will be on voters’ ballots between now and 2024. Spearheading the effort is Run for Something. The group plans to raise $80 million over the next three years for this push, which would include at least a hundred staffers to support those candidates in-state, according to Politico. Amanda Litman and Ross Morales Rocketto, Run for Something’s co-founders, call the project “Clerk Work”. “Election subversion in 2024 is not going to be a mob storming the Capitol, it’s going to be a county clerk in Michigan or a supervisor of elections in Florida who decides to fuck the whole thing up,” Litman said. “The only way to make long-term democracy protection is by electing people who will defend democracy.” The program will include every state where election administrators are themselves elected by voters. Run for Something is working in coordination with other Democratic groups on “Clerk Work.” Partners include American Bridge, a Democratic group that compiles and shares opposition research, and Open Democracy PAC, a super PAC that’s spending on advertising to boost these candidates.</p>

However, elections officials, though, remain unclear on how exactly the changes will be implemented. Some argue the accommodations for college could result in unfair changes for other residents. According to the Poughkeepsie Journal, the state is mandating colleges provide a polling site on campus or to work with the local boards of elections on deciding a suitable site near the campus. And, elections districts will have to be redrawn so that a campus is not divided. &#8220;The amended law has the potential to create more accessibility for students to vote,&#8221; said Jean Hinkley, assistant director of Vassar College&#8217;s Office of Community-Engaged Learning. &#8220;The visibility of polling sites will also hopefully be a reminder to students of the importance of voting.&#8221; However, questions remain regarding how the new requirements will work with existing law, as well as the timing of the implementation. While the change mandating colleges provide a polling site is scheduled to go into effect for this fall&#8217;s general election, the districts will not be redrawn until next year. A state Board of Elections spokesperson on Monday said, &#8220;our office is continuing to review this new legislation that will partially take effect for the general election,&#8221; before noting the polling sites for the general election must be designated by Aug. 1.</p>

That bill passed both the Alabama House and Senate and, yesterday, Governor Ivey signed it, making it the law in Alabama.</p>

Under the proposal, individuals convicted of sedition, insurrection, treason, or conspiracy to overthrow the government would be automatically banned from overseeing elections in Colorado. With clear allusions to Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, Secretary of State Jena Griswold testified in support of the bill. “Since the 2020 Election, our office has responded to previously unheard-of efforts to undermine the security of our elections. We have seen election officials here in Colorado and in other states compromise voting equipment and breach election security rules in the attempt to prove unfounded conspiracy theories,” Griswold said in a statement. “These actors, some of whom are elected to office and trusted by the public to uphold the security of our elections, have done the exact opposite — their behavior has tarnished public confidence in our elections and fueled false narratives about how elections function,” Griswold added.</p>

The measure, effective immediately, limits the signs to two per candidate at early voting sites and one at precincts on election day. “It looks like a carnival at the polling sites,“ Commissioner Christine Altman said in a prepared statement. “Some candidates are placing four, five or more signs at a single location. Multiple that by the number of candidates, and the problem is clear.” The ordinance also restricts the size of the signs to 2-by-3 feet, and they cannot be placed with metal or wood posts, but rather with wire stakes. Commissioner Steve Dillinger said commissioners considered whether the ordinance was unfair to challengers before they voted and decided it was not. “We are not trying to confine anybody,” said Dillinger, who has served on the commission for 32 years and is not up for re-election this cycle. ”We felt that if everyone went by the same rules that it would not be unfair. This is to prevent people from overdoing it.”</p>

The change will simplify the voting process, creating a different department to oversee the process, everything from the vetting of signatures on nomination papers to the collecting and counting of ballots. “This will separate elections from the office of the City Clerk,” said Council Vice President Isaac B. “Zac” Bears. “It creates a new department, with a new director.” The change is made in accordance with the state’s general laws governing elections: communities can opt for an appointed Board of Registrars under the auspices of the City Clerk and staff, or it can create a commission.</p>

The observers would be allowed within four feet of the ballots or envelopes, and would be allowed to question or challenge head election officials.  The ballot boards’ work would be livestreamed on Election Day and the week before, when absentee ballots are processed, and viewable on the Minnesota Information Technology Services website. The bill would also require livestreaming of absentee ballot drop boxes. The bill would also prohibit the release of any precinct election results until all results from that precinct have been counted, including absentee ballots processed by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Secretary of State Steve Simon said in a letter to lawmakers that the bill could create additional burdens for election administrators and poses a risk to voter privacy. “I understand the motivation in many provisions in the bill is increased transparency, but rigorous security measures are already built into our system, and we should work to bring the public further into the voting process using these existing procedures,” he wrote.</p>

Tate Reeves has signed legislation into law that requires the secretary of state’s office to<a href="https://www.mississippifreepress.org/22944/gov-reeves-signs-law-requiring-citizenship-checks-for-voting-in-mississippi/"> confirm that a new voter-registration applicant is an American citizen</a> by cross-referencing two databases: the Mississippi Department of Public Safety’s driver’s license and identification system and the federal Systematic Alien Verification For Entitlements database, also known as SAVE. The Mississippi secretary of state already cross-references the state database, but not the federal one.  Under the law, if both the state DPS and SAVE databases flag a voter as a noncitizen, the person will have 30 days to submit proof of citizenship to their local county clerk. If a person fails to submit proof and attempts to vote, they can cast an affidavit ballot, but must provide proof of citizenship within five days afterward for the vote to count. H.B. 1510 also repeals a 1924 law requiring naturalized citizens to prove their citizenship upon registering to vote by presenting their certificate of naturalization. A 2019 lawsuit challenged that law, saying it made voting harder for naturalized immigrants than other American citizens.</p>

Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen’s Office<a href="https://sosmt.gov/wp-content/uploads/4-19-2022-Legislator-Poll.pdf"> released the results</a> of a poll, asking all 149 sitting legislators whether they supported holding a special session on May 2. A total of 44 lawmakers, all Republicans, supported the call. 60, including 22 Republicans and 38 Democrats, voted against it. The remaining 45 lawmakers did not return their ballots by the deadline. 75 votes – a majority of legislators – were needed to call a special session. n March, ten Republican lawmakers sent a letter to Jacobsen, calling for the poll. They wanted to propose a “Select Special Interim Joint House and Senate Committee of Election Security,” to investigate the state’s election procedures. In their letter, they pointed to “the continuing and widespread belief, among a significant majority of Montana voters, that sufficient irregularities in election security in Montana create serious doubt as to the integrity of elections in our State.” The lawmakers said the committee should have subpoena powers and come with funding for legal staff and frequent meetings.</p>

Tom Brewer of Gordon, makes several minor changes to current law. Among other provisions, the bill: prohibits electioneering within 200 feet of a ballot drop box; establishes a deadline of 8 p.m. Central time or 7 p.m. Mountain time on Election Day for receipt of mail-in ballots; allows voters who cannot sign their name to use either a symbol or a signature stamp; allows county election commissioners to appoint certain election officials who live outside of the county if that county conducts elections exclusively by mail; requires non-governmental organizations distributing voter registration forms or early ballot application forms to use those prescribed by the Nebraska secretary of state; expands the definition of voting system to include software or service used in the process of creating, casting and counting ballots; allows an election commissioner or county clerk to remove a voter from the voter registry if they receive information from the state Department of Motor Vehicles that the voter has moved out of state; and establishes procedures for removing a voter from a county’s early ballot request list. Senators passed LB843 on a 45-0 vote.</p>

Under the bill, people would not need a reason to vote early in person, as they do now. It also implements processes for State employees to audit election results and create new enforcement procedures for potential voter fraud. As the bill is written now, voters 65 and up would be allowed to vote absentee. Isaac Cramer of the Charleston County Board of Elections urged senators to act quickly before the June Primaries.  &#8220;When it comes to early voting, and it comes to the opening of the absentee ballots, we would ask that you would pass this bill because the time is of the essence,&#8221; said Cramer. &#8220;Every day that passes that this bill does not go to the governor&#8217;s desk is another day where we need to get that to get that information out to the public.&#8221;</p>

Currently, the winner is the candidate with the most votes, even if that total is less than 50 percent. As proposed, if no one wins more than 50 percent of the votes after the ballots are tabulated, the “instant runoff system” the General Assembly authorized in 2020 would kick in. Limited for use only in city council and boards of supervisors’ elections, the system would drop the bottom vote-getter, with that person’s votes distributed to the remaining candidates based on the second-choice preferences of his or her supporters. Jordan is pushing to make Richmond the first locality in the state to adopt this method. Arlington and Fredericksburg also are considering adopting rank-choice voting. Jordan said that Richmond Voter Registrar Keith G. Balmer has expressed confidence that his office could successfully implement ranked-choice voting and educate voters about it before they go to the polls.</p>

The court heard testimony this week from former Secretary of State Wayne Williams and Deputy Secretary of State Chris Beall. A second hearing is scheduled for Thursday. Beall described the state’s motive for pursuing litigation against Peters, stemming in part from statements she made on podcasts, in press conferences and at public forums about her role in leaking voting machine images in 2021. “My view, and the secretary’s view, was an unrepenting admission of the unlawful action and gratitude that the action had occurred,” Beall told the court. Beall maintained the county’s elections were securely and accurately carried out in 2020 and 2021, even though conspiracy theorists cast doubts. The court did not indicate when or how it will decide the case, but election deadlines are fast approaching.</p>

The NC Court of Appeals issued an April 5 order temporarily blocking the ruling. Now the felons and their advocates are asking the state’s highest court to take the case out of the Appeals Court’s hands. “For the second time in this litigation, the Superior Court has sought to drastically change North Carolina’s election rules on the eve of an election,” according to a<a href="https://www.ncappellatecourts.org/show-file.php?document_id=303816"> brief</a> filed from Nicole Moss, an attorney representing state legislative leaders. “The court permanently enjoined Defendants to allow all convicted felons serving sentences outside of prison to register and vote. That injunction is irreconcilable with the North Carolina Constitution, which disenfranchises all convicted felons until ‘restored to the rights of citizenship in the manner prescribed by law.’” The March 28 decision threw out a 1973 state law setting rules for felons to regain voting rights. The law blocked voting for any felon who had not completed his full sentence. There’s no deadline for the Supreme Court to decide whether to take the case.</p>

In another 4-3 decision, the court ordered the Republican-controlled commission to file new district maps for the state Senate and House of Representatives by May 6.  The majority found that the latest set of statehouse maps, like the three previous iterations, violates the Ohio Constitution and its voter-approved amendment concerning redistricting and gerrymandering.  State election officials have said they need new maps to be finished by April 20, in order to have them ready for Aug. 2, the last possible day for a makeup legislative primary to be held. State legislative candidates have been pulled from the ballot for the regularly scheduled May 3 primary, which features a U.S. Senate race.  But the majority dismissed that concern in its unsigned opinion. “The so-called April 2 ‘deadline’ for implementing a General Assembly-district plan appears to be an artificial deadline that is based on a speculative, potential primary-election date for stat legislative races,” the ruling states.  The opinion added, “No matter what the primary date is to be, time is of the essence.”</p>

The complaint marks the second lawsuit that seeks to overturn maps approved by the Republican majority on the county&#8217;s governing body. Last month, the Justice Department filed a<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/politics/voting-galveston-texas/index.htm"> federal lawsuit</a> against the county on similar grounds &#8212; in a redistricting dispute that has garnered national attention. The new lawsuit &#8212; brought by the Texas Civil Rights Project and the Southern Coalition for Social Justice on behalf of local branches of the NAACP and the Galveston League of United Latin American Citizens Council 151 &#8212; alleges that the new map diminishes the voting power of Black and Hispanic voters by splitting up the only majority-minority precinct. The lawsuit alleges the Republicans majority pushed through a &#8220;racially discriminatory map&#8221; that &#8220;largely took place behind closed doors.&#8221; Sarah Chen, an attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project, called the map &#8212; and the process used by the Republican majority in the county to approve it &#8212; &#8220;egregious examples of people in power &#8230; exercising that power to dilute the votes of racial minorities.&#8221;</p>

According to the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, the reason for the decrease wasn’t known until pictures of the department’s website surfaced in response to the AJC’s reporting, showing that it had altered its online voter registration form last year. Before January 2021, drivers had to check a box if they wanted to decline to register or update their voting information. The website changed last year so that voters were required to click “Yes” or “No” when asked whether they wanted to register. Drivers received an error message if they didn’t select either option. The Department of Driver Services recently changed the website again so applicants can toggle a button to opt out of registration. Data isn’t yet available to show the effect of the change. The DDS told the AJC that it’s up to customers to decide whether they want to register to vote. “They make the choice. The question is still the same, and if that person wants to make a choice, that is their choice to make,” said Shevondah Leslie, an agency spokeswoman. “We cannot say that changes to the website made a difference.”</p>

Despite the rigorous steps that protect voter registration, ballot distribution, election systems and vote counting, conspiracy theories are undermining the public&#8217;s trust in this most basic act of a democracy. To combat this problem, experts from around the nation analyze the problem to provide actionable steps so election administrators can go on the offense to manage communications before, during and after an election. Hosted by the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. 9am to 12:30pm Central. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> April 22.</p>

On April 29, we are bringing together leading experts on election administration from across the country to discuss questions on many American’s minds: Can a presidential election be stolen?

What do the state-level legislative changes really mean for voter access and election security? <strong>When:</strong> April 29, 9:45am-3:15pm. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
