							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Media Literacy<br />
</strong><em>Thinking critically at this critical time</em></p>
<p>By, Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, executive director<br />
National Association for Media Literacy Education</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8438" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NAMLE-300x93.png" alt="" width="300" height="93" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NAMLE-300x93.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NAMLE.png 538w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The<a href="https://namle.net/"> National Association for Media Literacy Education</a> (NAMLE) is a nonprofit membership organization dedicated to media literacy being an essential life skill in the 21st century. We define media literacy as the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, create and act using all forms of communication. In its simplest terms, media literacy builds upon the foundation of traditional literacy.</p>
<p>The purpose of media literacy is to help individuals of all ages to develop the habits of inquiry and skills of expression that they need to be critical thinkers, effective communicators and active citizens in today’s world. To become a successful student, responsible citizen, productive worker, or competent and conscientious consumer, individuals need to develop expertise with the increasingly sophisticated, multi-sensory media world. Media literacy represents a necessary, inevitable, and realistic response to the complex, ever-changing information and communication landscape that surrounds us.</p>
<p>NAMLE has been in existence since 1997 but things changed in 2016 when media literacy education was launched into the cultural conversation thanks to the amplification of the term “fake news.” We have seen media literacy go from a concept discussed at academic conferences to a movement to ensure all people are equipped to navigate this complicated media ecosystem.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6599" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/misinformation-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/misinformation-300x150.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/misinformation.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />False information has a 70% greater chance of being disseminated than the truth. Why? Because fake news is created to stir up more emotions. And the human brain is more triggered by new, emotion-laden information. This has certainly proved to be a problem with real life consequences. But it’s not the only problem with fake news.</p>
<p>When we talk about fake news, we separate media messages into two buckets. We want to label them “true vs. false”, “real vs. fake” or even “fact vs fiction.”</p>
<p>But the problem is that media messages are complicated. They don’t just fall into two buckets. They fall into endless buckets. Media messages can be: news, opinion, advertising, entertainment, satire, humor. Even if you just hone in on misinformation: it could be propaganda, clickbait, sponsored content, hoax, conspiracy theory, disinformation, or even simply inaccuracy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8080" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Media-300x160.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="160" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Media-300x160.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Media-768x410.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Media.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If we limit our understanding of media messages to a simple binary label, we are missing out on deeper understanding. The goal of media literacy is to understand media messages – their purpose, value, audience, bias, and agenda. We strive to think deeper, to understand how media and information influence us – our beliefs, our values, our relationships. Media messages are impacting all of us and, unfortunately,  most people are not media literate.</p>
<p>Most people do not know what questions to ask, how to assess the information they consume or how to share and create media responsibly. While we have more information available to us than ever before, we are not more informed or knowledgeable. We are overwhelmed. Many of us get confused about what sources to trust and who has the most reliable information.</p>
<p>We all know that misinformation and disinformation is running rampant. Our state and local election offices know this better than anyone. Faced with the arduous task of running our elections, now state and local election officials are also being asked to combat false information and conspiracy theories. This is a tall order especially because we are only starting to understand why people believe what they believe in the public discourse.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0002831216679817">Educating for Democracy in a Partisan Age: Confronting the Challenges of Motivated Reasoning and Misinformation</a> (2017), researchers Joseph Kahne and Benjamin Boyer investigate youth judgments of the accuracy of truth claims tied to controversial public issues.</p>
<p>Consider these three points from the article:</p>
<p>…rather than learning from exposure to new information, individuals who encounter new information that contradicts their prior perspective often become even more favorable to their prior beliefs (Redlawsk, 2002).</p>
<p>Unlike the uninformed who are more likely to learn from exposure to new information, the misinformed are confident that they are correct, resist factually correct information, and use their misinformation to form their policy preferences (Kuklinski, Quirk, Jerit, Schwieder, &amp; Rich, 2000).</p>
<p>…a ‘‘backfire effect’’ can occur where presenting the misinformed with correct information not only often fails to reduce their misperceptions but actually intensifies their commitment to their inaccurate ‘‘knowledge’’ (Nyhan &amp; Reifler, 2010).</p>
<p>We often think the best way to combat false information is with facts but as this article shows factual information that opposes a person’s beliefs often leads people to just dig in on their beliefs even more. It’s really hard to change someone’s mind once they have formed a conclusion.</p>
<p>Falling for false information isn’t a sign of one’s intelligence. Humans look for information we believe or want to believe is true. This is confirmation bias and it’s super powerful. Think about how you feel about your favorite sports team or favorite singer. Is there really anything anyone can say that will change your mind about them? Probably not. You have your belief and it’s going to stick no matter how much counter information you are fed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3252" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PS_Woman-Using-Social-Media-on-Phone-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Confirmation bias is a huge issue right now with social media algorithms reading our likes and habits and creating filter bubbles where we may all live happily ever after with like minded people. Add to this anchoring bias, which is when we rely on the earliest information we receive on a subject, and you can see how hard it is to convince someone that their belief is incorrect.</p>
<p>So what can we do? Research shows that media literacy skills can help. Media literacy skills can be the difference between believing false information and understanding reliable information. Asking questions and critically thinking about the messages we receive and create before we draw conclusions is key.</p>
<p>Taking time to remember that media messages are complex, assess the purpose of the message, and determine what it wants me to do, think and feel is super important especially in the 24/7 media frenzy that surrounds us and especially with election information. Our democracy depends on it.</p>

Two candidates who finished second in House races in the Republican primary last week are asking for new elections in the two districts because of voting problems in<a href="https://www.al.com/news/2022/06/candidates-call-for-new-election-after-acknowledged-voting-problems-in-etowah-county.html"> Etowah County, Alabama</a> acknowledged by state, local, and party officials. Secretary of State John Merrill, the state’s top election official, said that redoing the primary is not allowed under state law. Officials in<a href="https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/politics/elections/vote-recount-arkansas-house-district-25-primary-race/527-70418253-7da1-4374-98e6-5df303561e24"> Washington County, Arkansas</a> conducted a recount this week after the winning difference in a House race was less than 10 votes. Election workers in<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/dekalb-county-continues-hand-count-of-ballots/RCTPBC5GKFB4PJ7EWJDTVQXKYE/"> DeKalb County, Georgia</a> spent their holiday weekend doing a hand recount of  a county commission race. Programming errors make the initial results for the race inaccurate and also caused problems with the recount when it began. The county is considering<a href="https://decaturish.com/2022/05/dekalb-elections-board-considers-delaying-may-24-election-certification-amid-questions-about-district-2-race/"> delaying the certification</a> of the election due to ongoing questions.  Officials in<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/briefs/idaho-secretary-of-state-preliminary-election-audit-results-show-low-margin-of-error/"> Idaho</a> successfully completed the first-ever random post-election audit of the May 17 primary.

The 50-50 split followed tabulations during last week’s canvass of in-person, traditional absentee and provisional ballots. State law directs a recount now must be performed. At press time,<a href="https://katu.com/news/local/clackamas-county-says-it-has-completed-the-majority-of-ballot-duplications"> Clackamas County, Oregon</a> had completed the task of duplicating mail ballots so they could then be process. The county will now focus on counting military and overseas ballots and processing ballots that need voter signature resolution, elections officials said in a news statement. The ballot printing error and the process to correct it has<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/05/31/oregon-secretary-of-state-weighs-in-on-clackamas-county-election-debacle/"> drawn the ire</a> of state elections officials and the<a href="https://www.wfmj.com/story/46584369/oregon-ballot-fiasco-highlights-invisible-election-chiefs"> scrutiny</a> of the<a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-oregon-presidential-portland-58bf0f3be79d7fdee0083e482c60d5a2"> media</a>.

While the legal battle over what ballots to count and not count continues in the courts (see Legal Updates for the latest), county elections officials in<a href="https://www.witf.org/2022/05/31/lancaster-county-and-dozens-of-other-counties-begin-recount-in-gop-u-s-senate-primary/"> Pennsylvania</a> because the process of recounting ballots in the statewide recount of the GOP presidential primary.

The Times how Cleta Mitchell is working with a well-funded network of organizations on the right, including the Republican National Committee, she is recruiting election conspiracists into an organized cavalry of activists monitoring elections. Mitchell is marshaling volunteers to stake out election offices, file information requests, monitor voting, work at polling places and keep detailed records of their work. One concern, according to The New York Times,  is the group’s intent to research the backgrounds of local and state officials to determine whether each is a “friend or foe” of the movement. Mitchell says she is creating “a volunteer army of citizens” who can counter what she describes as Democratic bias in election offices. “We’re going to be watching. We’re going to take back our elections,” she said in an April interview with John Fredericks, a conservative radio host. Politico has a piece that features video recordings of Republican Party operatives meeting with grassroots activists provide an inside look at a multi-pronged strategy to target and potentially overturn votes in Democratic precincts: Install trained recruits as regular poll workers and put them in direct contact with party attorneys. The plan, as outlined by a Republican National Committee staffer in Michigan, includes utilizing rules designed to provide political balance among poll workers to install party-trained volunteers prepared to challenge voters at Democratic-majority polling places, developing a website to connect those workers to local lawyers and establishing a network of party-friendly district attorneys who could intervene to block vote counts at certain precincts. Additionally, the Arizona Mirror has an article about State Sen. Kelly Townsend (R-Apache Junction)<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/05/31/gop-lawmaker-calls-on-vigilantes-to-film-and-follow-voters-to-combat-unproven-ballot-mules/"> calling on “vigilantes” to spy on people</a> who deposit early ballots in ballot drop boxes for elections later this year, imploring them to use hidden cameras and follow voters to their cars in an effort to stamp out unproven fraud alleged by a conservative group that aims to restrict voting. “We’re going to have hidden trail cameras, we are going to have people parked out there watching you and they are going to follow you to your car and get your license plate, so don’t try it. Don’t try it anymore,” Townsend added.</p>

Although the same boxes are used and they are labeled differently, in some locations, like near public libraries, the boxes are very close to each other. “Now, some of these boxes are positioned very close to COVID drop boxes,” warned Nick Jacobs, a spokesman with D.C. Board of Elections. “We simply ask that voters pay careful attention to which box they are putting their ballot in, and to put it in the right box,” Jacobs said. The possibility of confusion has been considered — and planned for. “Rest assured, we have protocols in place, with the Department of Health, to ensure that anyone who mistakenly puts their ballot in the wrong box will still have their ballot counted,” Jacobs said. “All ballots will collected multiple times every day, to ensure safety, security, and election integrity,” he said.</p>

Doug Ducey vetoed legislation which would have required county election officials to<a href="https://www.havasunews.com/news/gov-ducey-vetoes-voter-registration-disqualification-bill/article_4042e03a-de5e-11ec-9197-4334c025040b.html"> cancel the registration</a> of anyone they determine is not qualified to vote. The move, the first of the governor this session, came amid concerns from county officials that what was in HB 2617 could lead to mischief as it would allow individuals to make unsubstantiated claims that some people on the voter registration rolls should be removed. Jennifer Marson, executive director of the Arizona Association of Counties, said that, in turn, would trigger automatic investigations.</p>

The City Council on May 24 discussed the possibility of making the change from district-based voting but took no action. In California, only charter cities are authorized to convert to ranked-choice voting, according to an Ojai city staff report. As a general law city, Ojai must follow the state election code requiring candidates to be elected in a traditional plurality voting system. In 2019, the Legislature passed a bill that would have given general law cities, counties and school boards the option to adopt ranked-choice voting, but Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed it. City Attorney Matthew Summers said Ojai could be sued for even asking voters to consider ranked-choice voting. &#8220;Someone might try to pull it off the ballot contending we don&#8217;t have the right,&#8221; Summers said. &#8220;Folks have filed (lawsuits) to stop somebody from even going to the voters so I can&#8217;t say that there&#8217;s no risk.&#8221;  Putting the question to voters on the November ballot would cost the city $30,000, he said.</p>

Allen spokesperson Erik Salmi previously<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/13/dc-wont-move-forward-with-mobile-voting-measure/"> told the Washington Post</a> that he wouldn’t advance the bill because “he has heard from numerous elections and cybersecurity experts, as well as residents, with serious concerns” about the wisdom of pursuing electronic voting before the technology has matured to allow it to happen securely.</p>

House Bill 178, authored by Rep. Debbie Villio, R-Kenner, proposes a constitutional amendment to make it clear that in Louisiana someone must be a citizen of the United States to register to vote. Without the amendment, local governing authorities have the power to allow non-citizens the right to vote. Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin supported the bill. Some argued that the bill is a solution searching for a problem. The House had passed the bill 72-17.</p>

Larry Hogan (R)<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-hogan-final-vetoes-20220527-k3b342372jad7clnpyvb6fkkfa-story.html"> vetoed several elections-related bills</a> in his final year as governor. One bill Hogan vetoed would have allowed election workers to open ballots and begin processing them up to eight business days before the first day of early voting. And for this summer’s primary only, workers also could have begun tabulating those votes — without releasing the results — before polls closed on primary day, according to an analysis of the bill. Another bill Hogan vetoed was tor a voter who failed to sign the envelope containing their absentee ballot, the elections boards would have been required to notify them and give them up to 10 days to correct the mistake by sending in a picture of their signature by email, mail or coming in person. Starting June 1, 2023, they even would have been able to text a picture of their signature to elections officials. In his veto message, Hogan said he supports the earlier canvassing timeline and allowing voters to correct their signature-less ballots. But he said he was rejecting the bill because it lacked any way to verify the signatures in that process. “[A]s our vote by mail numbers rise, the missing piece in this legislation is that balance — for even the appearance of impropriety or the opportunity for fraud can be enough to undermine citizens’ confidence in their electoral system,” he wrote.</p>

Ann Bollin that aims to help local communities struggling to find suitable<a href="https://www.whmi.com/news/article/bollin-polling-places-elections"> locations to conduct elections</a>. She says the reform has long been a priority for Michigan’s municipal clerks. Bollin, a former Brighton Township clerk, is sponsoring House Bill 6071 to expand their options. Currently, school buildings, fire stations, police stations and other publicly owned buildings must be used as polling locations. If it is not possible or convenient to use a publicly owned building, a township or city may opt to use a building owned by a non-profit entity. House Bill 6071 would expand the options to include a privately owned building such as a banquet center or a recreation clubhouse, as long as the building is not owned by a candidate for office or someone who runs a political action committee. The measure received unanimous approval from the committee last week and advances to the full House for further consideration.</p>

If successful, the statutory ballot measure would require voters to present valid photo identification when voting in local and federal elections. Voters who don’t have a valid ID could request a “special identification document” with the voter’s photo and signature that could only be used for voting purposes. The ballot initiative is being supported by a political action committee dubbed R.I.S.E. Nevada – Restoring Integrity in State Elections. Signatures for statutory initiatives must be submitted to counties for verification no later than Nov. 23 in order to appear before the 2023 Legislature, which would have 40 days to approve the initiative If the Legislature approves the initiative, it becomes law. If they reject the initiative or fail to take action, the initiative goes before voters at the next general election, which would be in 2024.</p>

The bill stalled after a 20-16 vote in the upper chamber but was pulled from the agenda without the voting period being closed, a move that allows the bill to return at a future session without being reintroduced. Bills need yes votes from a majority of a chamber’s members — in this case, 21 — to succeed. The measure would allow election officials to begin tallying early in-person votes the day before an election and cleared officials to canvass mail-in ballots up to 10 days before an election. Supporters say it would allow election officials to finalize races sooner.</p>

Bills passed include: S.424, which allows split shifts for election inspectors or poll clerks; S.823, which Increases compensation of election inspectors to $300 and coordinators to $350 in New York City; S.4542, which prohibits conflicts of interest among board of elections employees; S.5800, which requires mandatory training curriculum for poll workers; S.6684, which establishes minimum staffing levels for local board of elections; S.7382, which would allow the passing out of refreshments to increase attendance at polls; S.8289, which requires a public hearing prior to the appointment of election commissioners; S.8292, which requires election commissioners to meet certain qualification; S.8311, which makes commissioners full time employees of the board; and  S.8337, which creates a way to remove an election commissioner.</p>
<p>A measure awaiting action by state lawmakers would<a href="https://www.niagara-gazette.com/news/local_news/democratic-measure-would-end-separate-elections-for-local-offices/article_3ca1cf83-959d-5d55-b870-3720c33267b3.html"> combine the election dates</a> for town offices with those for state offices in what supporters call an effort to fuse voter participation. Under the proposal, the elections for town and county offices would be shifted from odd-numbered years to even-numbered years, putting them in sync with elections for state legislative seats and contests for governor, attorney general and state comptroller. The lead sponsor of the legislation, Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, D-Scarsdale, said in the justification section of the measure that New York has experienced a pattern of low voter turnout in local elections. But leaders of the state Republican and Conservative parties argue the proposal is really aimed at making it difficult for non-Democrats to get elected to local offices in a state where the GOP is at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to voter enrollment.</p>

Lee Zachary, R-Yadkin, whose district includes a portion of western Forsyth County. Another primary sponsor is Jeffrey Elmore, R-Wilkes. The one-page bill has been placed in the House Elections Law and Campaign Finance Reform committee. If recommended by that committee, it would go to House Rules and Operations. It would be effective immediately if it becomes law. Zachary said his legislative office’s research “indicated that the two biggest problems with voter rolls in North Carolina are failure to purge deceased persons and failure to remove folks who have moved.” The death certificate notifications would be sent monthly to the board of elections where the deceased person resided. The monthly list would be based on death certificates reported to DHHS during the preceding month. Upon receiving the death certificate notification, county elections boards would have 30 days to remove the deceased person from the voting rolls, along with certifying the removal with the State Board of Elections.</p>

The Ohio Constitution provides home rule authority to municipalities and chartered counties. In 2020, the Ohio village of Yellow Springs adopted an ordinance allowing non-citizens to vote. At that point, Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, ruled non-citizens in that community could neither register to vote nor vote.  Backers of this proposed amendment say the concern is that a future secretary of state might view the issue differently. This proposed constitutional amendment is meant to take local control away from that situation.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are moving to spend<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/election/2022/06/ohio-senate-oks-20-million-for-aug-2-primary-election-adding-to-mounting-redistricting-costs.html"> $20 million to hold a special primary</a> election on Aug. 2. In a 31-1 vote, the Senate approved the extra funding, sending it to the House for consideration. They added it to<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/05/ohio-house-approves-sending-hundreds-of-millions-in-federal-coronavirus-aid-to-small-towns-townships.html"> an unrelated bill</a> awarding $422 million in federal coronavirus relief funds to townships and other local governments. Ohio is holding a second primary because delays in redistricting, the regular process of redrawing state legislative districts, resulted in new maps not being ready in time for the regular May 3 primary election, when Ohio otherwise held elections for statewide and federal offices.</p>

Plaintiff Lindy Blanchard asks the court to block Alabama from using electronic machines in the general election in November. She asked the court to require the state to count paper ballots by hand through a process spelled out in the lawsuit. The lawsuit names as defendants Secretary of State John Merrill, the state’s top election official. Also named as defendants are five officials who are members of the Alabama Electronic Voting Committee, a panel created by the Legislature to evaluate and certify voting systems. “Electronic voting machines cannot be deemed reliably secure and do not meet the constitutional and statutory mandates to guarantee a free and fair election,” the lawsuit claims.</p>

The decision not to defend the early voting system came from a mutual agreement between the Republican Party of Arizona, which filed the complaint, and the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, court records show. According to the Arizona Republic, it is not clear who initiated the move to leave the lawsuit. In a filing to the Mohave County Superior Court, state Solicitor General Brunn W. Roysden III stated the Attorney General&#8217;s Office agrees to be bound by the outcome of the lawsuit, including any appeals. The state GOP moved their lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of early voting to Mohave County after the state Supreme Court last month declined to take up the matter, saying it needed to start in a lower court.

Eight voters from across the country filed a lawsuit after the 2020 presidential election alleging various types of election interference and seeking $160 billion in damages. In April 2021, U.S. Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter dismissed the case after finding the plaintiffs had no standing, which requires a specific injury attributable to the defendants. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld Neureiter&#8217;s dismissal order on Friday, without addressing the specific claims in the lawsuit. &#8220;Accordingly, no matter how strongly plaintiffs believe that defendants violated voters’ rights in the 2020 election, they lack standing to pursue this litigation unless they identify an injury to themselves that is distinct or different from the alleged injury to other registered voters,&#8221; wrote Judge Timothy M. Tymkovich<a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/sites/ca10/files/opinions/010110689966.pdf"> in the panel&#8217;s May 27 order.</a></p>

John Mallozzi is charged with 14 counts each of filing false statements and second-degree forgery in the 2015 municipal election, when Stamford voters chose candidates to fill seats on the Board of Representatives, Board of Finance and Board of Education. It came to light after a Stamford man went to vote at his polling place in District 8 on Nov. 3, 2015 but was told he’d been recorded as having already voted by absentee ballot.  When poll workers checked the man’s signature against the one on his supposed absentee ballot, they found that the handwriting was different. The incident was reported to the State Elections Enforcement Commission, which traced the man’s irregular absentee ballot, and 13 others, to Mallozzi. After a 20-month investigation, SEEC officials reported their findings to the state’s attorney in Stamford. Mallozzi was arrested in January 2019 and pleaded not guilty two months later.  The status of the case is listed as “jury trial” on the Connecticut Judicial Branch website, and the next court date is July 26.</p>

The suit was filed in federal court in Chicago on behalf of Rep. Michael Bost from Carbondale, a state GOP committeeperson Laura Pollastrini and Susan Sweeney who was one of the state&#8217;s Republican presidential electors in 2020. A spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections said that it does not comment on pending litigation. The suit asks a judge to prevent election authorities from counting mail-in ballots that arrive in the days following in-person voting, arguing that a ballot “is not a legal vote unless it is received by Election Day.” Illinois law directs local election authorities to count ballots postmarked by the date of an election and received within two weeks of the election.</p>

Two groups, Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Mississippi Center for Justice, sued the state in 2019 on behalf of the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance and the League of Women Voters of Mississippi. “No state in the United States other than Mississippi subjects naturalized citizens to a higher proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration than U.S.-born citizens,” the lawsuit said.

Kerr’s mail-in ballot</a> because her signature didn’t match others on file. At 93, Kerr cast her final vote by mail in the November 2021 election just a month before her death. Because her signature on her ballot didn’t match the one on file and because she was no longer alive to verify the signature, the county board of elections rejected the ballot. “There was one on file from October of 2019, which you know was a very unsteady handwriting — that particular signature — and then the certification voters signed … has a very, very smooth and clear signature,” O’Neill said.  “The defendants point out that clearly these signatures don’t match, and I agree.” O’Neill pointed to testimony from Kerr’s grandson, Ryan, who said the signature was too neat to be his grandmother’s and that “somebody may have signed for her.” “Unfortunately, Mrs. Kerr passed away on December 5, 2021, so she wasn’t available here at the time of trial to come in and either confirm or not confirm that she intended to vote for the referendum or that that was her signature on the ballot,” O’Neill said.  “We don’t know at this point how she would have voted, but we certainly don’t know for sure at any event because the cure procedure set forth in the statute was not complied with.”</p>

Newark’s top lawyer, Corporation Counsel Kenyatta Stewart, said the judge told the parties he expected the Board of Elections to fulfill its obligations to uphold the voting rights of Newark residents, and he would allow the board to do so voluntarily. If there is an accessibility issue or other problem on election day, Stewart said Gardner informed the parties that he would be the judge on duty to address them.</p>

The two-sentence order — issued by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who oversees emergency matters arising from Pennsylvania for the court — threw a new variable into the high-stakes contest by blocking undated ballots from being counted in an unrelated election from Lehigh County last November. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, the immediate impact of Alito’s order on the Senate race remains to be seen. It focused solely on the counting of votes in a contested 2021 judicial race in Lehigh County. But much like the lower court ruling that prompted Alito’s intervention Tuesday, its repercussions could reverberate widely.</p>

McCormick is currently trailing by 922 votes as the state is set to begin a recount. According to elections officials, there are about 800 ballots that arrived on time, but with no date. For about 3 1/5 hours, the McCormick campaign and Dr. Oz campaign argued about whether the ballots should or should not count. The state also argued for the ballots to count, but the state GOP argued against it.  After the arguments and rebuttals, the judge adjourned without deciding.</p>

Piersol issued a wide-ranging opinion that sided with two South Dakota tribes, the Rosebud Sioux and the Oglala Sioux. The tribes brought suit in 2020, arguing that the Secretary of State’s Office was not adequately addressing federal law. The National Voter Registration Act requires state agencies to help voters register to vote when they interact with government agencies for other services. Licensing and public benefits are under the auspices of the Department of Public Safety and the Department of Social Services. Piersol found that the Secretary of State’s Office was not providing enough oversight to ensure those offices were fulfilling their responsibility under the act. Piersol also found that the Department of Public Safety was responsible for transmitting voter registrations to the county auditor, but numerous errors were stopping that process from happening. Piersol also ruled that when the Department of Public Safety contracts with other government agencies to provide licensing services, the department is still obligated to comply with federal voter registration requirements. Such so-called “issue sites” include the office in Dupree, South Dakota in the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation. “To the extent an issue site provides driver’s licenses services, it must comply with NVRA, and the state cannot avoid this responsibility because the ‘issue site’ is run by an agency other than DPS,” Piersol wrote.</p>
<p>The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe has filed suit over the<a href="https://www.mitchellrepublic.com/news/south-dakota/lower-brule-sioux-tribe-sues-lyman-county-over-redistricting-delay-alleges-dilution-of-native-votes"> timeframe of a redistricting map</a> that would change the way candidates are elected to the Lyman County Commission. The lawsuit, filed May 18 in federal court, alleges that a delay leaves Native Americans unrepresented in county government for the next two years and under-represented for another two years thereafter. Historically, the commissioners in Lyman County have been elected by district, but since the 1990 census, the county has instead selected their commissioners on an at-large basis. Since the release of 2020’s census data, the Lyman County Commission seeks to revert to a district-style election, adopting a new plan where members will be elected from two multi-member districts. Despite an effective date of June 4, 2022, the county said they need more time to update voter registration software, and will run this year’s election as an at-large race. “The current at-large method of electing members of the Lyman County Board of Commissioners dilutes Native American voting strength,” the lawsuit reads. “&#8230; [In addition,] the Board’s decision to delay implementation of its new redistricting plan was adopted with a discriminatory purpose.”</p>

There were no dissents noted from the<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/053122zr_6537.pdf"> brief order</a>, which clears the way for the depositions to go forward next month. The order came in a<a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/guillen-v-league-of-united-latin-american-citizens/"> dispute</a> that arose after the Texas legislature’s October 2021 adoption of new maps for congressional and state elections. Ten different lawsuits followed, filed by individual voters, civil rights groups, and the U.S. Department of Justice, alleging that the maps violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which bars racial discrimination in election policies. As part of their case before a three-judge district court, the challengers want to depose Texas legislators about the process that led to the new maps and the legislators’ motives in adopting them.

														<p><strong>State Misinformation Sheriff</strong>: <em>The New York Times</em> has an article this week about several states that are<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/technology/misinformation-sheriff-election-midterms.html"> putting more money and effort into combating false and misleading</a> information about elections. For instance, Connecticut plans to spend nearly $2 million on marketing to share factual information about voting, and to create its first-ever position for an expert in combating misinformation. With a salary of $150,000, the person is expected to comb fringe sites like 4chan, far-right social networks like Gettr and Rumble, and mainstream social media sites to root out early misinformation narratives about voting before they go viral, and then urge the companies to remove or flag the posts that contain false information. “We have to have situational awareness by looking into all the incoming threats to the integrity of elections,” said Scott Bates, Connecticut’s deputy secretary of the state. “Misinformation can erode people’s confidence in elections, and we view that as a critical threat to the democratic process.” Oregon, Idaho and Arizona have education and ad campaigns on the internet, TV, radio and billboards meant to spread accurate information about polling times, voter eligibility and absentee voting. Colorado has hired three cybersecurity experts to monitor sites for misinformation. California’s office of the secretary of state is searching for misinformation and working with the Department of Homeland Security and academics to look for patterns of misinformation across the internet.</p>

However, CISA has found no evidence that flaws in Dominion voting machines have ever been exploited, including in the 2020 election. According to The Washington Post, the move marks the first time CISA has run voting machine flaws through its vulnerability disclosure program, which since 2019 has examined and disclosed hundreds of vulnerabilities in commercial and industrial systems that have been identified by researchers around the world. There are nine flaws affecting versions of the machine called the Dominion Voting Systems Democracy Suite ImageCast X, according to a copy of an advisory prepared by CISA and obtained by The Washington Post. The ImageCast X allows voters to mark their candidate choices on a touch-screen and then produce a paper record, as was the case in Georgia. It can also be used as a paperless electronic voting machine. The flaws, many of which are highly technical and which mostly stem from machine design as opposed to coding errors, generally require an attacker to have physical access to the devices or other equipment used to manage the election, CISA said. “We have no evidence that these vulnerabilities have been exploited and no evidence that they have affected any election results,” said Brandon Wales, CISA’s executive director in a statement to The Post. “Of note, states’ standard election security procedures would detect exploitation of these vulnerabilities and in many cases would prevent attempts entirely. This makes it very unlikely that these vulnerabilities could affect an election.”</p>

That’s why it is so important that voters get the facts and why we’ve launched this resource.” The Secretary of State’s new misinformation fact check page is modeled off of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA)<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol"> “Rumor Control” web page</a> that debunks “common misinformation and disinformation narratives and themes that relate broadly to the security of election infrastructure and related processes.”  New Mexico’s<a href="https://www.sos.state.nm.us/voting-and-elections/voter-information-portal/rumor-vs-reality/"> “Rumor vs Reality”</a> web page focuses on the most prevalent misinformation that has circulated in our state and will be updated on an ongoing basis to address new issues as they arise. The website addresses questions that many voters have or may have heard about, such as “Can someone ever tell who I voted for?” (No), “Does New Mexico use paper ballots?” (Yes, in every election), “Are independent, post-election audits performed in New Mexico to ensure the accuracy of election results?” (Yes, along with a variety of other pre- and post-election safeguards).</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/facts-time-fiction-reporting-truth-amid-lies-and-disinformation">Facts in a Time of Fiction</a>: Journalists have long been charged with sorting fact from fiction through their reporting. But what happens when readers redefine what they see as truth and what they’ll accept as fact?  New York Times writer and author Elizabeth Williamson is among journalists confronting the rampant rise and spread of conspiracy theories through her reporting and research. Her current work has focused around unraveling the targeted misinformation and lies spread after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Conn., the surviving families’ lawsuits against Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and the election disinformation fueling the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack.  In this instructional program with the National Press Club Journalism Institute, Williamson will share her reporting and research process, along with insights she gained as she connected the dots on how conspiracy theories grow. Williamson, whose critically-acclaimed book “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/624175/sandy-hook-by-elizabeth-williamson/">Sandy Hook: An American Tragedy and the Battle for Truth</a>” published this spring, will describe how she threaded together more than 400 interviews, 10,000 pages of court testimony and other records, and on-the-ground reporting to trace a line from conspiracy theories around Sandy Hook to Jan. 6, 2021. Participants will learn to: Identify how misinformation and political conspiracy theories have spread; Work with sensitivity and clarity while reporting on conspiracy theories;  Pre-bunk conspiracy theories through early reporting; Use trauma-informed reporting methods while working with people suffering tragedy; and Organize reporting and deep research to craft a long-form narrative. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> June 10, 11:30am Eastern.</p>
<p><a href="https://hopin.com/events/tufts-circle/registration">CIRCLE Growing Voters</a>: How do we develop the next generation of voters and expand the electorate?
