							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election and law enforcement officials form joint initiative</strong><br />
<em>Committee for Safe and Secure Elections is a cross-partisan effort<br />
</em></p>
<p>By Tina Barton, senior election expert<br />
<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/">The Elections Group</a></p>
<p>“We will (expletive) take you out! … Watch your (expletive) back!”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Election Officials Are Under Attack (Full-Length Version)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WOCBIiVUBMc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>As I listened to the message laced with profanity and threats, I immediately felt shocked, nauseated and fearful. My mind was reeling and my emotions were all over the place, worrying about not only my safety but the safety of my family and friends.</p>
<p>The author received the first voicemail message played in this video in the days following the 2020 General Election.</p>
<p>The past two years have brought many challenges and unknowns for election officials, including death threats, verbal assaults, intimidation, and scare tactics. Many of us found ourselves in situations we had never been in before – having conversations about personal safety with our families and law enforcement that we never expected to have.</p>
<p>Because I believe that public servants like election officials should be able to do their jobs without fearing for their lives, last month I joined more than two dozen current and former law enforcement and election officials from across the country in announcing the formation of the<a href="https://safeelections.org/"> Committee for Safe and Secure Elections (CSSE)</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-8555" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-06-at-4.10.41-PM-300x114.png" alt="" width="445" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-06-at-4.10.41-PM-300x114.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-06-at-4.10.41-PM.png 470w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" />Our committee is cross-partisan – meaning that Republicans like me have joined with Democrats and others, spanning the ideological spectrum, to solve this problem. We combine the expertise of both the law enforcement and election administration professions and are committed to providing guidance and training so that every member can help prevent and respond to intimidation, threats, and violence against election officials, election workers and voters.</p>
<p>When we became election officials, none of us imagined we would have to secure our homes, pack go-bags, and move our families from one location to another.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOCBIiVUBMc"> The threatening voicemail message</a> I shared wasn’t the only one I received, and it was just one of the thousands of documented instances of threats and other harassment directed at election officials that continue through today. Not to mention the intimidation that’s gone unreported.</p>
<p>I am fortunate to have a husband who serves as a law enforcement officer and other friends and family members with law enforcement experience. I cannot imagine what my experience would have been like without them, but too many election officials can. I know that many of my colleagues across the country face these types of threats without similar support. The rhetoric has not stopped and the threats have not ceased – but now we have CSSE to turn to.</p>
<p>We will achieve the committee’s goal of protecting elections, election workers and administrators, and voters by helping law enforcement and election offices understand each other and learn how to respond to threats by working together.</p>
<p>If your jurisdiction and its counterpart law enforcement agency are interested in receiving support from the committee, sign up<a href="https://airtable.com/shr9KDBHAMTvVxYzi"> here</a>. A committee member or supporting organization will get in touch with you.</p>
<p>CSSE’s<a href="https://safeelections.org/members"> 32 cross-partisan members</a> include current and former sheriffs, police officers, state and local election officials, and other experts in cybersecurity and election administration.</p>
<p>Through this effort, the committee wants to work to make sure that others do not have to go through what our colleagues and I did. And for those who experience these threats and harassment, we want to make sure relationships and systems are in place beforehand to support them.</p>

The language is a traditionally non-written language and will require qualified interpreters at the polls. New data from the Census Bureau in 2021 determined that Nye County will now be required to offer language assistance to the Duckwater Shoshone Tribe of the Duckwater Reservation, including Shoshone translation of all voting materials. Language assistance in the county will be required through at least the 2024 and 2026 elections. A few months ago, the Native American Rights Fund started working with Nye County election officials and tribal representatives on establishing a process for in-person translation at a polling site on the reservation in time for the general election in November.  Nye County Clerk, Sandra Merlino, said so far one tribal elder has agreed to work as an interpreter for the election office and offer translation services to voters on the reservation. “There really isn’t a program in place as of now, hopefully eventually there will be something,” Merlino said. “Right now it’s just a start.”</p>

Economy filed the recount on behalf of losing candidate Jason Tedder. Nevada County’s vote, certified last week, shows Natalie Adona winning the clerk-recorder race with 22,800 votes, or 67.9%. Tedder received 7,843 votes, or 23.3%. Paul Gilbert took 2,942 votes, 8.8%. “It could take hours,” Economy said of the recount. “It could take months. It could take days. It doesn’t matter. There’s no price for democracy.” Election law states that the person requesting the recount is responsible for its cost. That cost must be paid before the recount begins. Greg Diaz, clerk-recorder/registrar of voters  said he doesn’t know the precise cost of the recount, but estimated it could be $3,000 to $5,000 a day. Additionally, because the recount is for the clerk-recorder/registrar of voters law states that the governing body must appoint someone other than the elections official to conduct the recount. Additionally, the recount must begin no later than seven days after the request was received.</p>

This is the second annual contest for the county and there are six finalists. Voting, by the public, continues through the end of the month and one sticker, designed by 14-year-old Hudson Rowan of Marbletown currently has about 94% of the vote—about 19,500 votes. What’s so special about  Rowan’s sticker? Well social media users seem to feeling a bit of kinship with the psychedelic spider. “Pretty accurate portrait of how voting feels right now,” said @LoveLoriM on Twitter. &#8220;Well I definitely thought it was unique,&#8221; John Quigley, the Republican commissioner for the Ulster County Board of Elections, which is running the contest, said about Hudson&#8217;s entry. &#8220;Somebody tweeted, this is how voters feel about politics right now, and I thought it was almost like the best way to summarize it. It sort of is exactly how we all feel about politics right now.&#8221;</p>

According to the Reporter-Times, Elliott is being remembered this week as not only a public servant to Morgan County, but as a friend to so many that knew her. &#8220;Stephanie and I go back a lot of years,&#8221; Morgan County Council President Kim Merideth said. &#8220;On a friendship side, she was always just there for everyone.&#8221; Morgan County Board of Commissioners Chairman Kenny Hale had similar sentiments about Elliott. &#8220;She was a very talented lady who brought a lot to the clerk&#8217;s office as well as the election board,&#8221; Hale said. Hale noted that he appreciated Elliott&#8217;s work moving Morgan County to voting centers. &#8220;She really was a bulldog that really went out and fought for what was best for the voters in Morgan County and getting that put together and all finalized and done,&#8221; Hale said. Morgan County Republican Party Chairman Daniel Elliott said Stephanie Elliott was always fair in her office&#8217;s dealings with election matters. &#8220;When it came to elections, she was all about making sure the process was done correctly and that everybody had their fair chance,&#8221; Daniel Elliott said. &#8220;She was one of the good ones and she will be dearly missed.&#8221; He noted that the decision to switch to voting centers was a difficult one for election officials in Morgan County, but Stephanie Elliott always had what was best for voters in her mind.</p>

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), head of the Senate Rules Committee, has introduced legislation to improve the delivery of election mail and ensure voters don’t have to pay to return ballots.  The bill — the<a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/01/klobuchar-introduces-election-mail-bill"> Election Mail Act</a> — would codify First-Class service standards for all election mail, require the U.S. Postal Service to postmark all ballots and ensure voters and election officials don&#8217;t have to pay or pre-pay for postage on ballots.  It would also require states to count absentee ballots that are postmarked by election day and arrive within seven day after the election, while permitting states to have deadlines of more than seven days. Under the new legislation, USPS would be reimbursed for returning domestic mail-in ballots.</p>

The law was proposed by Sen. John Velis, D-Westfield, based on his experience of voting in the 2018 midterm election when he was serving in Afghanistan. Velis is a major in the U.S. Army Reserve. The new law allows military members to vote through a secure online portal instead of through mail or by fax. It mirrors laws that 15 other states have adopted in the past, Velis said. It will replace a cumbersome multi-step process that sometimes is difficult for service members to follow, especially if they are in remote locations, he said. Before, military members had to submit an application for an absentee ballot to their town or city clerk. The ballot was then emailed or mailed to them. If it was emailed, the voter had to print out the ballot, fill it out and either scan it into email, fax it back or mail it, Velis said.</p>

Kathy Hochul signed, an overhaul of the state’s handgun licensing rules. As part of the rules, people won’t be allowed to carry firearms at a list of “sensitive places” which include<a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/ny-lawmakers-approve-new-legislation-on-handgun-restrictions/40498300"> polling places</a>. New York will also bar people from bringing guns into any business or workplace unless the owners put up signs saying guns are welcome. People who bring guns into places without such signs could be prosecuted on felony charges.</p>

If voters pass the measure, experts say Multnomah County will be the first jurisdiction in Oregon to give noncitizens the right to vote. Charter committee member Samantha Gladu, who helped craft the charter change, said volunteers who studied the charter anticipate the Multnomah County measure will face legal challenges if voters approve it. When the committee recommended referring the measure to the ballot,<a href="https://multco-web7-psh-files-usw2.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/Voting%20Rights%20Subcommittee%20Recommendation%20Form_0.pdf"> the group noted that “negative impacts</a>” could include a “potential legal challenge” as well as a “potential backlash against immigrants and non-citizens.” Gladu emphasized the point was to get a broad measure on the ballot and let the courts give Multnomah County a roadmap on what was legally possible. “The language we adopted in the recommendation is as broad as possible,” Gladu said. “Because of it being a legal gray area here in Oregon, we wanted to ensure that we’re able to figure out what is to the fullest extent legally possible.”</p>

Daniel McKee last week signed legislation that could allow some of the state’s registered voters to<a href="https://statescoop.com/rhode-island-governor-signs-bill-allowing-internet-voting/"> cast their ballots over the internet</a>, despite concerns raised by election officials and critics of electronic voting. The new law,<a href="https://legiscan.com/RI/bill/S2118/2022"> S2118</a>, calls for giving deployed military service members, citizens residing overseas and people with physical disabilities the ability to receive and submit their ballots online. While the legislation passed the Rhode Island General Assembly earlier this year with comfortable margins, it raised criticisms from election-security advocates who’ve long said that submitting votes over an internet connection could imperil the secret ballot. Under the new Rhode Island law, eligible voters could request an electronic ballot if the secretary of state’s office approves a system that’s gone through “one or more independent security reviews” and meets the scrutiny of the cybersecurity framework published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to block Arizona from enforcing a new law about who can vote for president. In a lawsuit filed this week, the agency contends Arizona has no legal right to demand<a href="https://fronterasdesk.org/content/1792954/department-justice-sues-over-arizona-voting-law"> proof of citizenship</a> from those who use a federal voter registration form to vote in federal elections. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who heads the agency&#8217;s civil rights division, said that runs afoul of the National Voter Registration Act. Clarke also said the state is a &#8220;repeat offender,&#8221; approving the requirement earlier this year in HB 2492 despite a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling to the contrary. But Clarke said the problems with HB 2492 are deeper. She pointed out that the legislation also imposes some new requirements on everyone who registers, requirements her agency — and federal law — considers illegal because the information is not &#8220;material&#8221; to whether someone is eligible to vote. Most notably, the new law that is set to take effect at the end of the year says that all voter registration forms must include an individual&#8217;s place of birth. &#8220;Prior to HB 2492, Arizona voter registration forms did not require applicants to provide their specific city or location of birth — and for good reason,&#8221; Clarke told reporters at a telephonic news conference. &#8220;That information is not material to establishing whether a voter is a U.S. citizen because of naturalization and expatriation patterns, among other reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Arizona Supreme Court<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arizona/articles/2022-07-06/court-wont-fast-track-arizona-ags-election-fight-appeal"> refused to fast-track an appeal</a> from Attorney General Mark Brnovich after a judge sided with Secretary of State Katie Hobbs over election rules. The decision means there is unlikely to be time before the general election for court battles to play out on Brnovich&#8217;s appeal and updated 2019 election rules will remain in place for the general election. A Yavapai County judge last month rejected Brnovich&#8217;s effort to order Hobbs to do a major rewrite of a nearly 300-page document she wrote telling county election officials how to manage the 2022 elections. Brnovich has not filed a formal appeal, but asked the Arizona Supreme Court to let him bypass the court of appeals to the high court could hear the case quickly and act before the November elections. The Supreme Court said it had considered Brnovich&#8217;s request and determined it did not meet the standards for bypassing the lower appeals court.</p>

Filed in a Spalding County Superior Court last week, the lawsuit seeks to unseal the secretary of state primary ballots, allow them to be scanned by Garland Favorito, the co-founder of Voter GA and his associates, invalidate the May 24 secretary of state primary and hold another primary for the position that conducts Georgia&#8217;s elections. Favorito, of Roswell, Georgia, said two primary election audits motivated the lawsuit — one official audit that found the last-place finisher in a county commission race actually got the most votes, and another unofficial, over-the-shoulder audit conducted by Voter GA that found Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was awarded about 15% more votes than he actually received.</p>
<p>At least two Republicans lawmakers will be required to testify before the<a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime/trump-probe-fulton-judge-hears-from-lawmakers-challenging-subpoenas/I6MOR3OCGFER7DFL2XL7I74NLQ/"> Fulton County special grand jury</a> investigating former President Donald Trump and Georgia’s 2020 elections, a superior court judge indicated Friday. But Fulton Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney suggested that prosecutors will be significantly limited in what they can ask. McBurney did not come to a final decision about what exactly the District Attorney’s office can ask Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, former state Sen. William Ligon of Brunswick and several other unnamed state legislators. But at a 90-minute hearing Friday, McBurney said anything related to their conversations with other legislators or motivations are off-limits. “I’m not quashing any of these subpoenas, but I want to create a framework,” said McBurney, who is expected to finalize guidelines for questioning in the days ahead. In other grand jury news, the special grand jury has<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/05/1109871416/grand-jury-subpoena-giuliani-eastman-graham"> issued seven subpoenas</a> including one for attorneys Rudy Guiliani and John Eastman as well as South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham.</p>

The state Republican Party contends the law is unconstitutional and could encourage voter fraud. The MassGOP argues the state constitution only allows people to cast absentee ballots in certain circumstances. Michael Walsh, an attorney for the party, argued early voting should also be banned, even though the state has conducted it for the past eight years. Walsh claimed that the legislature lacked constitutional authority to re-write the state&#8217;s election laws. But Assistant Attorney General Adam Hornstine urged the justices &#8220;to affirm the constitutionality of theVOTES Act,&#8221; which he said, &#8220;expands the rights of voters to participate in upcoming elections.&#8221; &#8220;The legislature has broad powers to deal with elections,&#8221; Hornstine said. The lawsuit challenging the voter rules was filed by Jim Lyons, chairman of the Republican party, and others. The court is expected to issue a decision well ahead of the September primary.</p>

The decision came late in the afternoon the day before the signatures were due to Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen&#8217;s office, meaning petitions still must have signatures from 5% of registered voters in 38 counties to get on the ballot. Judges Raymond Gruender, of St. Louis, Missouri, and David R. Stras of Minneapolis, Minnesota, split with Judge Jane Kelly, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who said she would have denied the motion. The state&#8217;s emergency appeal and motion for stay followed U.S. District Court John Gerrard&#8217;s ruling last month in favor of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, blocking Evnen from enforcing the multicounty requirement and his denial of the state&#8217;s request for a stay, which followed.</p>

It took effect in January, granting an estimated 800,000 to 1 million noncitizens the right to vote in municipal elections, including next year&#8217;s races for Council seats. The lawsuit, brought by both local and national Republicans, was filed against Mayor Eric Adams, among other defendants. Adams, a Democrat, had not supported the law, but didn’t oppose it either. His predecessor, Bill de Blasio, expressed misgivings about the measure’s constitutionality, but let it become law without his signature. Porzio, sitting on Staten Island, ruled the measure violated the state constitution. Immigrant rights advocates argued that the granting of voting rights to “citizens” did not strictly mean American citizens but something broader.</p>
