							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Now Live: Democracy Fund’s Language Access for Voters Summit Landing Page</strong><br />
By: Tammy Patrick and Becky Stewart, Democracy Fund</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Democracy Fund launched <a href="https://democracyfund.org/idea/language-access-for-voters-summit/">a new landing page</a> for its annual Language Access for Voters Summit. Users can view or download the complete set of materials featured at the Dec. 2021 convening. We celebrate the diversity of languages in the United States, and hope this <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8063" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LanguageAccess-300x230.png" alt="" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LanguageAccess-300x230.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LanguageAccess-1024x786.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LanguageAccess-768x590.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/LanguageAccess.png 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />resource inspires further efforts to remove language barriers from the voting process.</p>
<p>The timely new resource is designed to provide insight, inspiration and ideas on how to serve voters in the 2022 midterm election and future cycles. The complete set of speaker presentations, panel discussions, personal stories, and more are available to view or download. As the primaries are about to begin, 331 jurisdictions are now covered under Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act. Ninety of these are new to coverage, and twelve have an expanded number of languages they must provide assistance to voters on. The bottom line: this process will be new for some election administrators, but there are resources and partners to help along the way. Explore the resource page <a href="https://democracyfund.org/idea/language-access-for-voters-summit/">here</a>, and learn more about the summit and available materials below.</p>
<p><strong>Removing Language Barriers from the Voting Process</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7535" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.31.56-AM-300x288.png" alt="" width="300" height="288" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.31.56-AM-300x288.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.31.56-AM.png 678w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Democracy Fund’s Dec. 2021 Language Access for Voters Summit followed the Dec. 8th release of the <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/section-203-voting-rights-act.html">Census Bureau’s new Section 203 language determinations</a> under the Voting Rights Act—which provide language assistance in U.S. elections. To help election officials navigate and implement the new changes, the <a href="https://democracyfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-Language-Access-for-Voters-Summit_Agenda-1.pdf">agenda</a> featured discussions with local, state and federal election officials, and voting rights advocates. Participants shared pragmatic ideas, tools, and best practices for providing language assistance—focusing officials’ immediate needs in the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections.</p>
<p>The first day featured primers on the Census data and foundation for the determinations. The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-kristen-clarke-delivers-remarks-democracy-fund-s-language">U.S. Department of Justice’s Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke also delivered remarks</a> on the Voting Rights Act requirements and federal enforcement of compliance:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Voting is a cornerstone of our democracy and the United States is a diverse country, with citizens who speak numerous languages. All eligible voters deserve access to the ballot, and language should not stand as a barrier to participation in our democracy. You can reach the Civil Rights Division’s internet reporting portal at https://civilrights.justice.gov/ or you can call us at (800) 253-3931.”</em></p>
<p>Attendees heard how some states have expanded language assistance beyond Section 203 in two prominent ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Providing assistance to the communities they serve in languages beyond the four Section 203 categories. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon highlighted this approach in his remarks. View his remarks in the Day One video library<a href="https://democracyfund.org/idea/language-access-for-voters-summit/"> here</a>.</li>
<li>Using data thresholds to determine language assistance and coverage. While the focus is often on the Federal Registry’s covered languages and jurisdictions publication, those that came close should also be considered. Asian Americans Advancing Justice publishes a<a href="https://www.advancingjustice-aajc.org/publication/factsheet-2021-new-section-203-coverage-and-asian-americans"> Fact Sheet</a> resource that all election offices should review, and the final panel on the first day of the summit highlighted how Colorado used this approach following the passage of<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb21-1011"> House Bill 21-1011</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Celebrating the Diversity of Languages in the United States</strong><br />
The two-day event featured a collection of speaker-submitted videos in Armenian, Bengali, Dine’ (Navajo), English, Korean, Mandarin, Spanish, and Yup’ik. These represent a small sample of the languages election officials provide voter assistance for across the United States. Thank you to the <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8062" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/YupickIVoted-300x190.png" alt="" width="300" height="190" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/YupickIVoted-300x190.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/YupickIVoted-768x485.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/YupickIVoted.png 934w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />election offices from across the country, (Alaska, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Harris County, Texas, Los Angeles and Orange Counties in California, Coconino and Pima Counties in Arizona) for sharing not only the diversity of languages, but the myriad of ways the languages are provided. In person assistance at the polls, recording of audio files for voting equipment, phone support—all channels where voters are served need to be covered and those staffing them need proper training. Training resources and techniques were shared throughout Day 2 including videos from the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/language-access-resources"> Election Assistance Commission</a> of the resources they have available.</p>
<p>Speakers read the 2020 Presidential Election ballot in various languages from their jurisdictions, highlighted the critical value of language and culture integration in formal settings like polling places, and shared personal stories of how language access has played a role in their own life or someone they love.  Listening to the reading of the ballot text highlights the unbiased presentation of the materials and how important translator and pollworker training is to ensure that voters receive the aid they need to effectively participate.</p>
<p><strong>Constructive Partnerships</strong><br />
Advisory boards and community feedback are critical elements for any language program as a way to identify proper service levels, areas of <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-8064 alignright" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-17-at-11.31.10-AM-150x150.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" />coverage, vetting of translations and protocols, partnering in the dissemination of correct information, and recruitment of translators and pollworkers.  The Summit featured numerous speakers who shared their experiences with how productive relationships improve the voters’ experiences and the likelihood that they will cast ballots successfully, rather than have them rejected. A<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/A-Guide-for-Building-Cross-Sector-Collaborations-to-Strengthen-Democracy_FINAL.pdf"> case study of one such project</a>, the Future of California Elections (FOCE) was highlighted here on electionline in<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2021/10-14/"> Oct. 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Accurate, official, and trusted information is more critical now than ever. We know that when information deserts exist, as they do within many limited English proficient communities, mis- and disinformation find fertile ground to grow. The final panel of the Summit provided outstanding resources from the Center for Community Media at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  They provide a comprehensive listing of<a href="https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/centers/center-community-media/maps-directories/"> maps and directories of community media outlets</a> to leverage in public messaging, voter education, and outreach.</p>
<p>We know from the<a href="https://democracyfund.org/idea/amplifying-the-perspectives-of-officials-at-the-front-lines-of-elections/"> Stewards of Democracy</a> collaborative research with<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/leo-survey-summary/"> Reed College Elections and Voting Information Center</a> that finding sufficient bilingual pollworkers and translators can be a real challenge.  In 2020 only 23% of election officials surveyed felt confident that they would be able to find adequate staffing.  The 2022 survey tool will be launching soon and hope to see a vast improvement on that number—democracy is not a spectator sport and it will take all of us (again).</p>

An article from NBC News highlights the issue of<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/amateur-fraud-hunters-bury-election-officials-public-records-requests-rcna15432"> public records requests</a> that are overwhelming some elections offices, especially those smaller offices that don’t necessarily have a staff member dedicated to fulfilling such requests. Officials in five states—Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia—told NBC News that the number of asks, which include requests for voter rolls, images of ballots and technical information about voting machines, has surged in the last year despite overwhelming evidence that U.S. elections are fair and free. &#8220;Every other day there&#8217;s a new public records request on something from 2020 or some process,” said Wesley Wilcox, the supervisor of elections in Marion County, Florida. “I spend the vast majority of my day either just providing accurate information, fighting myths and rumors, responding to public records requests.&#8221; All but one of the officials interviewed for this article said the time-consuming requests are stretching their limited resources and that they take up a significant amount of time.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3343" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Paperwork Part II</strong>: Route 50, a publication that focuses on state and local governments, has an interesting article this week about how<a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/tech-data/2022/02/paper-shortage-ballots-could-pose-difficulties-elections/361994/"> supply change issues with paper</a> could impact the 2022 elections. We’ve already seen that to some extent in<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/18/texas-voter-registration-forms/"> Texas with issues surrounding enough paper to print new voter registration forms</a> to accommodate language from new laws. “It&#8217;s difficult to know exactly what the impact will be because we are not sure at what point these supply deficits will be filled,” Democracy Fund’s Tammy Patrick told Route Fifty. “We have a situation where we have this high-quality ballot paper stock that we need for things ranging from voter registration forms, envelopes, provisional ballot forms, applications for ballots and even something as simple as a voter identification card,” she said, adding that U.S. elections are “still deeply rooted in the use of paper.”</p>

Throughout his distinguished career, Senator Randolph demonstrated tireless determination to successfully pass the 26th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, granting 18, 19, and 20-year-old American citizens the right to vote.  “Senator Randolph was a champion for young people’s suffrage. His relentless dedication was the perfect example of selfless action in the realm of public service that this award is meant to honor,” said Kyle Ardoin, NASS President and Louisiana Secretary of State. “The members of NASS are tremendously proud to recognize him for his important work and historic legacy.&#8221; Senator Randolph was nominated for the award by<a href="https://sos.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx"> West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner</a>. “West Virginia is honored to call Senator Jennings Randolph one of our own. Randolph once said, ‘I believe that our young people possess a great social conscience, are perplexed by the injustices which exist in the world and are anxious to rectify these ills.’ Senator Randolph’s confidence in the youth of our nation paired with his sheer tenacity is what turned his efforts into reality. He is an in­spiration to me and a true American statesman,” said Warner. During the ceremony held at the West Virginia State Capitol the award was virtual­ly accepted by Senator Randolph’s two sons, Mr. Jennings “Jay” Randolph, Jr., and Mr. Frank Randolph. The audience was made up of over 200 student leaders from 21 Jennings Randolph Award-winning West Virginia high schools recognized for registering at least 75 percent of eligible students to vote. Additionally, the ceremony honored the 50th anniversary of Ms. Ella Mae Thompson Haddix&#8217;s voter registration, the first 18-year-old in America registered to vote. At the time, Haddix was a student at West Virginia’s Davis &amp; Elkins College and was escorted to register by Senator Randolph.</p>

During his 12-year tenure, Condos has overseen the implementation of same day registration, automatic voter registration, online voter registration, ADA accessible voting, enhanced cybersecurity, universal vote-by-mail, ballot drop boxes, and ballot curing. “The position of Secretary of State is critically important in the protection of citizens’ voting rights and upholding our democracy,” Condos said. “It should not be viewed as merely a stepping-stone for higher office.” Although he’s leaving the office far more advanced than he found it, he is concerned about the future. “Our Democracy is in dire straits right now, and I really believe that we have to take steps to re-take and reset the democratic principles that we have always operated under,” Condos said.</p>

The report, entitled <a href="https://www.nonprofitvote.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Americas-Nonprofits-Get-Out-The-Vote.pdf">“America’s Nonprofits Get Out the Vote,”</a> represents the first-of-its-kind analysis of voter engagement, including voter registration and get-out-the-vote work, across the nonprofit sector as a whole. “Finding out that 20% of America’s nonprofits do voter engagement work is an affirmation of what we have always believed – that nonprofits across the nation understand their vital role inbuilding democracy,” says Brian Miller, Executive Director of Nonprofit VOTE. “But the fact that the share of nonprofits doing voter engagement work climbs dramatically for nonprofits serving or led by communities of color shows that these nonprofits see the crucial link to racial equity and fostering a more inclusive democracy.” The new report shows clear trends  that suggest a key driver in motivating nonprofits is the connection between democracy building and racial equity. Among nonprofits primarily serving Black or Hispanic communities, communities historically underrepresented in our democracy, 34-35% do voter engagement work. In addition to the community served, who is leading the organization matters. “For those looking for a definitive connection between democracy building and diversity, equity and inclusion work, this report acts like a roadmap to guide you directly to the kinds of nonprofit organizations having the biggest impact,” says Lindsay Torrico, Vice President of Policy and Advocacy at United Way Worldwide. “We see the results as a mandate to nonprofits eager to create a more inclusive democracy, as well as the philanthropic community who can help fund and expand their efforts.”</p>

She was 62. Leider retired in 2021 after managing more than 40 elections for the city. Leider was remembered as an adept manager of elections and a passionate baseball fan. “Anna was brilliant, kind, and had a wonderful smile,” former Mayor Allison Silberberg wrote on Facebook. “Her enthusiasm for life was contagious. A few years ago, I ran into her at the start of a Nats game. I distinctly remember how she was all decked out in Nats gear, ready for the game. Later, she cherished that our team won the World Series.” Although she was a big baseball fan, when she was 16 she entered a national essay contest for 14-18 year olds sponsored by the National Football League which asked students to describe “The NFL’s Role in American History.” Her essay, “Why is Football so American won her a $10,000 NFL college scholarship and tickets to Super Bowl X. Leider graduated with a B.A. from Amherst College in Massachusetts and an MBA from New York University. Jack Powers, Secretary of the Alexandria Electoral Board<a href="https://thezebra.org/2022/02/15/alexandrias-former-voter-registrar-anna-leider-62-loses-battle-with-brain-cancer/"> said</a>, “Anna Leider was the General Registrar when I was appointed to the Electoral Board in March of 2015. I immediately knew I was in the presence of an intelligent, resourceful, and compassionate leader. She knew the details of election laws and practices extremely well. She was able to communicate with Alexandria’s voters, elected and appointed officials, as well as her staff and the Board so we all understood what are often arcane legal matters and practices. The Alexandria Electoral Board, as well as our community, has lost one of its best.”</p>

The new rules restrict access to the voting systems, with new requirements for account access and cutting in half the number of people who can get inside voting systems. The rules are said to be temporary but will be effective immediately. The directives include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Password and User Account Security: Creates various additional requirements for passwords and user accounts for voting system equipment.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Acceptable Use Policy: Requires signing of the Department of State’s “acceptable use” policy for voting system equipment for individuals who will have access to that equipment. This is comparable to our acceptable use policy for the statewide voter registration database (SCORE), which has been in place for several years.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Hard Drive Imaging: Prohibits the creation of images of the hard drives of the voting system equipment and disclosure of such images without prior approval by the Department of State.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Trusted Build Procedures: Addresses procedures that county clerks must follow during a trusted build, including that evidence of a successful background check must be disclosed to the Department of State for all individuals who will be present during the trusted build. In addition, the county clerk must ensure that the trusted build is conducted under video surveillance.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Seal Requirements: Counties must continuously comply with seal requirements and may not allow any unattended voting system component to remain unsealed at any point after trusted build has been installed on the component.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Access to Secures Areas and Voting Systems: Any individual who is prohibited from having physical contact with any voting equipment under section 1-5-607(1), C.R.S. may not access a room with voting equipment unless accompanied by one or more individuals with authorized access. This means that in counties with a population over 100,000, elected officials may not enter a room with voting equipment alone. Prior to the temporary rules, only physically accessing equipment was restricted.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Access to Election Management Systems: Counties may grant administrative privileges to no more than four individual users, which is a decrease from 10 previously authorized, further access permission is approved by the Department of State. Counties must identify the employees with administrative privileges in the security plan filed with the Department of State.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Every Colorado voter, Republican, Democrat, and Unaffiliated alike, deserves accessible and secure elections. As Secretary of State, I will always protect the integrity of our election system,”<a href="https://www.coloradosos.gov/pubs/newsRoom/pressReleases/2022/PR20220210VotingSystems.html"> said</a> Griswold. “These rules address emerging security risks and will reinforce Colorado’s national leadership in election security.”</p>

Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Senate rules and administration committee, which has oversight over federal elections. “We must continue to help both state and local election officials modernize their voting equipment, improve the administration of elections, and strengthen cybersecurity for election systems,” the<a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/d/2/d2041e6b-d893-4e2e-97f0-1a34d982d275/22E91AB1674CF0600D6E3BB42C9F93EB.sen-klobuchar-letter-to-biden-on-election-security-funding.pdf"> letter</a> said in urging Biden to include the funding in his upcoming fiscal year 2023 budget proposal. According to The Washington Post, the vagaries of Senate rules mean any action this year would have to be bipartisan, and Republicans appear to be highly<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/16/election-funding-midterms/"> skeptical of any new election spending</a>. Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who helped engineer a $380 million federal investment in elections in 2018, said there was simply too much federal money left unspent by the states to consider additional rounds of funding. According to the federal Election Assistance Commission, roughly $435 million in election security funding remains unused in state accounts. That funding, however, cannot generally be used to cover increased operating costs; in most cases, states are holding it in reserve for planned voting machine upgrades. The $400 million in 2020 covid emergency aid, meanwhile, is largely spent and cannot be used for this year’s election in any case. “I’m just not looking to be able to send the states more money for election stuff when they already have it,” Lankford told The Post. Congress could pass a new omnibus appropriations bill as soon as next month, spending more than $1 trillion to keep government agencies funded through September. But that deal is unlikely to include significant money to help beleaguered state and local election officials, lawmakers said this month.</p>

It’s a subscriber-only article, but well worth the read if you have a subscription and honestly, if you follow elections closely, it may be time to subscribe to this particular publication. According to the paper, about 140 bills of nearly 1,700 bills submitted at the Legislature this year deal with some aspect of elections. Some of the bills by Republican and Democratic legislators make only technical changes to voting or the election system. About two dozen are progressive ideas supported by Democrats that don&#8217;t stand a chance in the GOP-dominated Legislature. The remaining proposals address issues of security in elections and who is allowed to vote. Many have raised concerns about voter suppression and practical governance of elections. Eighteen lawmakers are listed as prime sponsors of the 100-plus bills, but just five are responsible for more than half. Legislative rules require a committee hearing on each bill by Feb. 18 — House bills in House committees, Senate bills in Senate committees. Bills that fail that first step likely won&#8217;t progress for the year. If the bills pass the full House and Senate, the next important date for them is March 25. That&#8217;s when bills must again be heard in committee, but House bills must be heard in Senate committees and vice-versa.</p>
<p>The Senate Government Committee has approved Senate Bill 1573 which would<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/02/11/gop-proposals-aim-to-revamp-hand-count-audits-done-after-every-election/"> overhaul the way counties conduct post-election hand count audits of ballots</a>. After every election, counties must conduct a hand count of ballots from 2% of its precincts and 1% of the early ballots cast to ensure they match up with the tallies from the machines used to tabulate ballots. Counties can base their hand counts on voting centers instead of precincts if that’s how they conduct their elections. The audits are conducted by members of county political party organizations. The bill would make other significant changes to the post-election audits. Hand counts would take on a greater significance because counties would be barred from conducting their official election canvasses until the audits were completed. Counties would have to count at least 5% of precincts’ ballots instead of 2%. They currently have the option of counting more than 2% of precincts, but aren’t required to do so.</p>

Existing law prohibits an establishment where the primary purpose is the sale and dispensation of alcoholic beverages from being used as a polling place. This bill would delete that prohibition. The following language would remain: A polling place may not be connected by a door, window, or other opening with any place where any alcoholic beverage is sold or dispensed while the polls are open.</p>

House Bill 22-1086, otherwise known as the Vote Without Fear Act, would ban open carry of firearms within 100 feet of polling places, drop-off ballot boxes and vote counting centers. The bill does offer some exceptions for police officers acting within the scope of their authority, as well as private property owners who live within 100 feet of these locations. The bill passed its first committee hearing on Monday, with votes split along party lines. It will continue through the legislative process. If passed, it would go into effect immediately. Anyone open carrying a firearm could face a $1,000 fine and up to 364 days in jail.</p>

The legislation would have expanded the statutory definition of sickness so voters could more easily qualify for an absentee ballot.</p>

Initially a bipartisan effort, the idea is now being met with resistance. Opponents fear the legislation would enable endless “audits” driven by losing candidates who will never accept defeat, turning any ambiguity or mistake into the next stolen election claim. The bill’s backers say it would allow the public to verify elections, identify errors, detect counting mistakes and hold election officials accountable. Under the legislation, original paper ballots generated by voting touchscreens could be inspected by the public, but to avoid tampering, they could only be handled by election workers, who could hold or display them. Individuals or organizations who request ballot inspections would be responsible for their costs, which could reach tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire additional election staff for a countywide review. An examination of a single precinct or a specific batch of ballots would be less expensive. Local election officials opposing the measure say ballot inspections would burden election workers and do more harm than good. Under current state law, original ballots can only be unsealed by a court order.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5969" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IDCap-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IDCap-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IDCap-768x576.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IDCap.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Idaho:</strong> The House State Affairs Committee has approved a bill prohibiting “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-elections-voting-idaho-election-2020-317b5d150886603b75bed353d7624152">ballot harvesting</a>” and another tightening the timeline for unaffiliated voters to joint a political party before an election. The committee sent both bills to the full House with “do pass” recommendations on party-line votes, after hearing opponents testify that both amounted to voter suppression.  The first bill from Rep. Mike Moyle, a Republican from Star, would make it a crime to take mail-in ballots to the post office for anyone who is not a person’s household member. The second bill from Rep. Doug Okuniewicz, a Republican from Hayden, would require unaffiliated voters to join a political party before the candidate filing period closes if they want to vote in a closed primary election. This year, that would mean Idaho’s roughly 310,000 unaffiliated voters would have to affiliate by March 11 if they want to vote in the closed May 17 primary. Current state law allows unaffiliated voters to make that decision at the polling place on Election Day.</p>

The committee voted unanimously to strip the provisions from a bill that was approved last month along party lines by the Republican-dominated House. The proposal would have required voters who requested mail-in ballots to swear under possible penalty of perjury that they wouldn’t be able to vote in person at any time during the 28 days before Election Day. Sen. Greg Walker, of R-Columbus, said he believed the proposed restrictions would cause “valid confusion” among some people who would want to vote by mail. “I don’t see any evidence that it provides us any more security or accountability in the election process,” Walker said. The bill would now leave unchanged Indiana’s current mail-in voting limits allowing people to vote by mail if they fall into one of several categories, including being 65 or older, confined to their homes, scheduled to work throughout the 12 hours Election Day polling sites are open or being absent from their home counties on Election Day.</p>

Before last year’s election law changes, county auditors could start mailing absentee ballots 29 days before Election Day. Under current law, they can start mailing absentee ballots 20 days before Election Day. Rep. Dennis Bush, R-Cleghorn, sponsored a bill that would allow county election officials to start mailing ballots three business days before that. Clayton County Auditor Jennifer Garms is president of the Iowa State Association of County Auditors, which supports the change. She said there are some security concerns when election officials are trying to mail ballots and handle in-person early voting at the same time in a shortened timeframe. “We do not have a lot of office space,” Garms said. “So we usually end up having to move our ballots to a different office or put them in cages and move them out of the building entirely. We don’t want to have those ballots leave our offices, period.”</p>
<p>Iowa would see new absentee ballot<a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/02/16/lawmakers-push-election-bill-to-change-absentee-voter-id-election-funding-laws/"> voter identification requirements, statewide recount procedures and restrictions on private money funding</a> elections under a proposal zooming through the Iowa House and Senate.<a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=89&amp;ba=HSB719"> House Study Bill 719</a> comes just one year after Republicans passed a wide-ranging election reform bill that shortened absentee voting windows, restricted ballot drop-boxes and introduced a new penalty for auditor misconduct. Subcommittees in the House and Senate approved the bill Wednesday, and the House State Government Committee passed it. Sen. Roby Smith, leader of the bill in the Senate, said he expects the bill to move through the Senate State Government Committee on Thursday. Under the bill, Iowa voters would need to write their driver’s license number or voter PIN on the outside of an absentee ballot’s affidavit envelope. The ballot would be considered a defect if the ID number on the outside of the envelope did not match the number on the absentee ballot. State and county commissioners of elections would be barred from accepting or using any private money to conduct an election under the Senate proposal. Instead, they would rely wholly on public funds, appropriated from the state or federal government. The bill sets out a new statewide standard for recounts, including allowing larger recount boards for larger counties and permitting a candidate to request whether the count is done by a machine or by hand.</p>

In addition, House Bill 2570 would require new process-and-procedure audits of four randomly selected counties in odd-numbered years following a federal election. The secretary of state’s office and election reform organizations are backing the legislation. Clay Barker, deputy assistant secretary of state, said process audits would test voting machine accuracy, review the list of registered voters and in-person early voters, examine reasons for rejecting provisional ballots and look at signature verification materials. He said Secretary of State Scott Schwab’s office worked with the Kansas County Clerks and Election Officials Association to make certain reforms in the bill were attainable.</p>

Senate Bill (SB) 159 seeks to extend Election Day polling hours to 7:00 P.M. to give eligible voters more time at the polls to cast their ballot. SB 159 allows for automatic voter registration at the department of motor vehicles when applying for a driver’s license unless declined by the applicant. It would also permit those who are not yet registered the ability to register and vote on Election Day. Lastly, SB 159 expands mail-in voting by allowing “convenience to voter” as a reason to vote absentee. Additionally, it adds in-person absentee voting beginning 12 working days prior to the election. SB 159 will be considered if the General Assembly decides to hear the bill during the 2022 Regular Session.</p>

Dan Eubanks, R-Walls, a  far-right members of the legislature, is the vice chair. House Speaker Philip Gunn, R-Clinton, had saved the bill for deadline day, a time when controversial legislation is often introduced. Rep. Brent Powell, R-Brandon, offered a strike-all amendment stripping the bill of almost all its controversial language. Minutes later, House Minority Leader Robert Johnson, D-Natchez, offered his own amendment to make it harder for election officials to remove people from voter rolls. Powell supported the amendment without argument. After virtually no debate, the House, a Republican supermajority, voted with the Democrats to approve a largely watered-down version of the original bill.</p>
<p>Both chambers of the state Legislature have passed bills aimed at ensuring<a href="https://www.djournal.com/news/state-news/house-senate-pass-laws-to-prevent-noncitizens-from-registering-to-vote/article_bc8edfcd-34f2-5677-a2e4-27e0b2bb6618.html"> noncitizens</a> can&#8217;t register to vote in Mississippi, even though state law already prevents them from doing so. Both <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2022/pdf/history/HB/HB1510.xml">House Bill 1510</a> and<a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2022/pdf/SB/2600-2699/SB2606PS.pdf"> Senate Bill 2606</a> would allow Mississippi’s election management system to cross-reference voter registration information with state driver’s license system at the Mississippi Department of Public Safety to see if a noncitizen is registering to vote. According to the legislation, if a person is flagged by the state system as potentially being a noncitizen, that person’s name will be checked with the federal immigration database. If both the federal and state database flag the person who registered to vote as a noncitizen, county clerks would send that person a card in the mail notifying them that they will have 30 days to submit proof they are a U.S. citizen. Under the House version, if a person fails to submit proof within 30 days, they will be purged from the voter roll. Under the Senate version, if a person doesn’t present proof of citizenship within 30 days, their voter registration status will be marked as “pending for the next two federal elections. If a pending voter does not submit citizenship proof within the 30-day timeframe and still attempts to vote, they would be forced to cast an affidavit ballot during the election. The flagged voter would then have a few days to present citizenship information to their county clerk’s office for the affidavit vote to count.</p>

That may soon change. A new bill — sponsored by Sens. Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex) and Jim Beach (D-Camden) — would alter the rule by requiring counties to purchase machines that create a paper trail when older machines age out. The bill would allow the New Jersey secretary of state to waive the requirement for machines used in an election before the bill’s effective date, which comes on the first day of the third month following its passage. The proposal would bar the secretary of state from issuing such waivers for machines purchased or leased after that date.</p>

Currently absentee ballots are available by request only for each election. The initiative also would expand the availability of monitored ballot drop boxes and expand voting options in Native American communities where requested.

The bills included HB3234, that would have required elections outside of major state-wide election dates to receive 40 percent voter participation to be considered valid, HB3233 that would have required candidates to declare a party affiliation when filing to run for office, even in non-partisan races.

The bill would also increases penalties against people who are convicted of harassing an elections worker. The extra penalties would apply if the harassment takes place either during the worker’s official duties or in response to an action taken during their official duties.</p>
<p>House Bill 4147, which Democratic lawmakers introduced January,<a href="https://boltsmag.org/prison-voting-stalls-in-oregon-again/"> would allow people in prisons to register to vote and vote by mail</a>—as is standard across Oregon—with their ballot counted in the last county they called home before their sentencing. The bill mirrors a proposal that died in committee last year after representatives from Oregon Department of Corrections argued the law would hamper mailroom operations inside the state prison system. Oregon Republicans quickly decried this year’s bill as more evidence of “Democrats’ shameful pro-criminal agenda.”   The prison-voting bill now seems to have little chance of advancing before the end of Oregon’s 35-day session, which began February 1.

Voters without a DMV-issued ID or driver license are currently required to register using a paper form by providing the last four digits of their Social Security Number and a signature. Democrats argue that the paper forms need manual data entry, which can introduce errors into voter rolls and cost about $4.72 per registration. Under the new bill, voters without ID could do the same process online by entering the last four of their SSN and uploading an image of their signature via a secure online portal. HB 4133 A passed the House in a vote of 33-23, moving to the Senate for consideration.</p>

Despite the chamber’s 25-15 vote, there likely won’t be a voter referendum on the proposal after the measure was rejected by a Republican-controlled House of Delegates subcommittee last week.  The push for a ballot referendum on felon voting rights had received bipartisan support in Virginia, with one House Republican sponsoring his version of the proposal. That bill was killed in subcommittee on the same day the Democratic proposal was tabled.</p>

Currently, images of election ballot return envelopes can be requested by members of the public under public records laws. Those images contain voter signatures, phone numbers and emails. This bill, however, would protect that personal information from being disclosed. Rep. Mike Volz, R-Spokane, a bill sponsor, said people expect their signatures to be exempted from public disclosure. Requests for envelopes in the past have only concerned individual envelopes, Spokane County Auditor Vicky Dalton said, but this year counties received requests for entire files of all their collected return envelopes. Dalton said she wasn’t sure why so many large requests came in this year, and she can’t ask requesters why they want records. “That’s when it became apparent that there was additional protection that really needed to be formalized,” Dalton told The Spokesman-Review in January.</p>

<p>A measure backed by Washington Gov.

The bill,<a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5843&amp;Year=2021"> SB 5843</a>, failed to get a vote in the state Senate before a key cut-off deadline this week. The bill would have made it a gross misdemeanor for candidates and elected officials to knowingly make false statements about the legitimacy of an election, if those statements were intended to incite lawlessness and, in fact, resulted in individuals or a group damaging property or harming others. The prime sponsor of the measure, Democratic state Sen. David Frockt, said the proposal didn’t have the votes to pass. “We have to respect that the bill in its current form did not have enough support to advance despite the care we took in its drafting through our consultation with leading First Amendment scholars,” Frockt said in a statement.</p>

The measure would require any plans for federal election money to get approval from the Legislature&#8217;s Finance Committee. Currently, the Wisconsin Elections Commission allocates those funds based on federal guidance. Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu &#8211; R-Oostburg &#8211; the bill&#8217;s lead sponsor, said the bill would ensure the state maintains control of election administration. &#8220;<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2021/related/proposals/sb941">SB 941</a> ensures the people of Wisconsin, through their elected representatives,&#8221; said LeMahieu, &#8220;can review, amend or block any efforts by the Executive Branch of the federal government to interfere with Wisconsin elections administration.&#8221; The bill also would require state agencies to submit new federal election guidance to legislative leadership, and would bar those agencies from implementing the policies until they receive the go-ahead from a legislative rules committee.</p>

According to<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2022/HB0074"> bill text,</a> if no primary candidate for a statewide or federal office receives at least 50% of the vote, a runoff election would be held with the top two vote-getters. Instead of being held in August, primaries would be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in May in general election years. If a runoff were necessary, it would take place in August. A similar proposal was narrowly defeated in the Senate in 2021. With Republican victories all but assured in most offices in the general election in Wyoming, bill sponsor Chip Neiman (R-Hewlitt) told Wyoming Public Media that races are really decided in the primaries. However, he added, “To me this legislation is non-partisan. … It’s the desire to forward a candidate that has [not just] a plurality, but a majority of the votes to send them along into a general election.”</p>

The state NAACP, the lawsuit plaintiff, says that the Republican-controlled legislature lacked authority to create the referendums because federal courts had declared nearly 30 districts used in 2016 elections were unlawful racial gerrymanders Legislators elected in 2016, however, were allowed to remain in their elected positions until the next General Assembly elections in 2018. Districts covering well over 100 of the 170 General Assembly seats were redrawn by then. A trial judge agreed in early 2019 that the General Assembly had exceeded its authority to place the referendums on the ballot and struck down the amendments. A split state Court of Appeals panel overturned that ruling in 2020, however, saying such a standard would allow anyone to challenge any conventional legislation approved by a majority of lawmakers, causing chaos and confusion. Kym Hunter, an attorney representing the NAACP, said her client is seeking narrow relief — the declaration that legislators lost the ability to propose referendums to the constitution, which are effectively impossible to remove if approved. “The relief plaintiff seeks striking two constitutional amendments is unprecedented and wrong,” Martin Warf, a lawyer representing top legislative leaders  said, adding that “the General Assembly never lost its authority to act, and its acts are not subject to an institutional attack.” Six of the seven justices hearing the case asked questions during arguments. A ruling may not be known for months.</p>

The March 15 date is one week after the State Supreme Court hears arguments on the appeal on March 8. Their ruling is the one that will ultimately decide the fate of mail-in voting. Leavitt says the mid-March date will help county boards of elections notify voters of any change in the law, as the May 17 primary looms.

The plaintiffs filed their complaint Feb. 7 in Davidson County Chancery Court in support of the voting method that enables voters to rank candidates in elections, also called rank choice voting. This is their fourth filing to reverse decisions against instant runoff voting by Coordinator of Elections Mark Goins, a former state representative. Instant ranked voting “promotes good government and less ideologically fractious candidates need to compete not only for a vote but also for rankings that might not be the first ranking in order to secure victory,” the lawsuit states. “This encourages candidates to communicate with and appeal to a broader swath of voters than they might otherwise.” The group claims instant runoff voting also saves governments and candidates money by eliminating runoff elections if no candidate receives a majority of the votes. In addition, the group contends the method gives a better opportunity to lesser-known candidates who are not funded as well and might be “dismissed” by voters as “throwing away their vote.” Thus, it could make elections more competitive and increase voter participation, the filing claims.</p>

Rodriquez temporarily blocked the state from enforcing the rule against Harris County’s election administrator until the rest of a lawsuit plays out. Although the scope of Rodriguez’s preliminary injunction is limited, the judge dealt the first legal blow to new elections restrictions and voting changes Republican lawmakers enacted last year. The injunction applies to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and local county prosecutors in Harris, Travis and Williamson counties. The state is expected to appeal the ruling. The lawsuit was brought by Harris County election administrator Isabel Longoria and Cathy Morgan, a volunteer deputy registrar who is appointed to help register voters in Travis and Williamson counties. According to The Texas Tribune, Rodriguez took particular issue with the lack of a clear definition for what constitutes soliciting when talking to voters, even those 65 and older who automatically qualify to vote by mail under the state’s strict rules. “It has a chilling effect,” Rodriguez said while questioning a state attorney during a hearing Friday morning. “They don’t know when they’re going to run afoul of this vague [law].”</p>

The tribal government, along with its human rights commission and five tribal members, claim the five-member county commission violated the Voting Rights Act by approving a district map that packs Native American voters into a single district. The map approved by the commission in December deprives Native American voters from &#8220;equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice in the other four districts despite them constituting almost 40% of the county&#8217;s total population,&#8221; according to the Feb. 10 news release that announced the lawsuit. The action by the commission adds to the history of racism and voter suppression that members of the Navajo Nation face in the county and in municipalities, the complaint states. The complaint was filed on Feb. 10 by the Navajo Nation Department of Justice along with several civil rights groups in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico. Along with the county government, the lawsuit names Commissioners John Beckstead, Terri Fortner, Steve Lanier, Michael Sullivan and GloJean Todacheene and County Clerk Tanya Shelby as defendants.</p>

Drop boxes can still be used for next week&#8217;s primaries. Two suburban Milwaukee men last year sued to block the use of ballot drop boxes. A Waukesha County judge in January agreed with them and ruled they could not be used. An appeals court quickly stepped in and ruled the drop boxes could be used in the February primary because it was happening so soon. The state Supreme Court took over the case soon afterward and kept in place the ruling that allowed the use of drop boxes for February. The state Elections Commission and others asked the high court to extend that policy until at least April. The justices declined to do that on Friday, saying they would let the lower court ruling go into effect that bars the use of drop boxes for that election and ones after it. The justices&#8217; ruling is not the last word in the case. It is expected to decide the case in the coming weeks or months, and that ruling will determine the ultimate fate of drop boxes. The majority in the decision consisted of the four justices who were elected with the support of Republicans. The three justices elected with backing from Democrats were in dissent. Writing for the dissenters, Justice Ann Walsh Bradley contended the order could give voters and clerks whiplash as the rules on ballot boxes change.  &#8220;Once again, a majority of this court makes it more difficult to vote,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;With apparent disregard for the confusion it is causing, the majority provides next to no notice to municipal clerks, changing procedures at the eleventh hour and applying different procedures from those that applied to the primary in the very same election cycle.&#8221;</p>

Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling had recommended the members of the WEC be charged with election fraud. The sheriff&#8217;s recommendation of charges in October was met immediately with &#8220;strenuous disagreement&#8221; from the commission, which said in a<a href="https://elections.wi.gov/node/7561"> statement</a> that it had acted &#8220;in a thoughtful, public, and hours-long discussion at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic&#8221; with a bipartisan vote that ensured those in nursing homes were able to vote by mail.</p>
