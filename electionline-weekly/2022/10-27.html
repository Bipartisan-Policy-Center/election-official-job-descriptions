<em>Secretary of states who oversee elections are on the ballot in 24 states</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>The state’s top elections official is on the ballot in 24 states on November 8 and in several states, including <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8343" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alaska, Florida and Texas, who wins the governor’s seat will determine who runs that state’s elections</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.wpr.org/normally-quiet-secretary-state-race-erupts-questions-elections-power-and-democracy"> Wisconsin</a>, while the secretary of state does not currently have oversight of elections, if Republicans take control of the state, they have vowed to give election oversight to the secretary of state.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say that<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/us/politics/secretary-of-state-races-midterms.html"> more</a><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/10/27/election-deniers-already-are-disrupting-the-midterm-election"> has</a><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/24/election-deniers-secretary-of-state-00062383"> been</a><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/politics/secretary-of-state-races-to-watch/index.html"> written</a> and<a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/critical-role-secretaries-of-state-play-in-midterm-elections-1666823651/"> reported</a> at the state and national level and more money has poured into secretary of state races than ever before.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/10/secretary-of-state-candidates-have-raised-a-record-56-2-million-for-2022-election/"> Open Secrets</a>, collectively secretary of state candidates have raised $56.2 million since January 2021. Democratic secretary of state candidates have raised nearly $31.6 million and Republican candidates have raised almost $23.5 million.</p>

The Reuters/Ipsos poll, completed on Monday, also found that two-thirds of registered voters fear that extremists will carry out acts of violence after the election if they are unhappy with the outcome. Kathy Boockvar, former Pennsylvania secretary of state, said fears of voter intimidation and violence run counter to American tradition. &#8220;Our country is based on democracy. We should be excited about Election Day,&#8221; said Boockvar, a member of the bipartisan Committee for Safe and Secure Election. Among the registered voters polled by Reuters/Ipsos, 43% were concerned about threats of violence or voter intimidation while voting in person. The fear was more pronounced among Democratic voters, 51% of whom said they worried about violence, although a still-significant share of Republicans &#8211; 38% &#8211; harbored the same concerns. On Monday, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/politics/voter-intimidation-justice-department-merrick-garland-polls-fbi-sheriffs/index.html"> the U.S. Department of Justice would not permit voters to be intimidated</a>. “The Justice Department has an obligation to guarantee a free and fair vote by everyone who’s qualified to vote and will not permit voters to be intimidated,” Garland said during a press briefing. Additionally, Samantha Vinograd, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for counterterrorism, threat prevention, and law enforcement, on Monday said the agency is “certainly very focused on what we consider to be an incredibly heightened threat environment” ahead of November’s elections. She cited conspiracy theories swirling online and the history of extremist groups in the United States as reason for concern.</p>

In a Public Service Announcement released this month, the FBI and CISA warned the public that, because foreign actors may attempt to “manipulate information or spread disinformation in the lead up to and after the 2022 midterm elections,” voters should be wary around websites that solicit voting information that are not using .gov. To address this problem, election websites — and all government websites — need to adopt .gov widely enough that voters know to look for it as an indicator of trustworthiness.

Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe said she wants to help residents understand who runs elections and how they do it. “We know people are really hungry for that information,&#8221; Wolfe said. &#8220;We wanted to make sure we have lively, energetic content that helps them understand exactly how elections work.” The commission worked with the state Department of Public Instruction to offer lesson plans that accompany the videos. The videos, about five to seven minutes each, cover subjects like who election officials are, how to register to vote, how officials keep voting information secure, and a walkthrough of how to vote in person. The lesson plans cover valid forms of voter identification, ways to register to vote, questions about who should be allowed to vote, and how to serve as a poll worker. In focus groups of high school students who helped shape the lessons, WEC communications specialist John Smalley said there was a clear need for &#8220;baseline&#8221; information on how elections function. &#8220;It was not that surprising that there wasn&#8217;t a great baseline of knowledge there, so we felt like we could go forward with a pretty baseline level of how the elections process works,&#8221; Smalley said. Additionally, Wolfe said, the videos are meant to explain how officials keep elections secure and accurate.</p>

Cochise County Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby voted for the measure after rejecting a first proposal that mentioned 100 volunteers who had already been vetted and trained for the hand count. The third board member, chairwoman Ann English, is a Democrat who voted against both proposals, arguing that the country’s insurance would not protect it from expected lawsuits. “I implore you not to attempt to order this separate hand-count,” said County Attorney Brian McIntyre, a Republican. He said such action would be unlawful and supervisors could be held personally liable in a civil action. The first proposal that was rejected said that volunteers “are wishing to take part in this way to help people (including a few of the participants) who have lost trust in elections to see that elections are reliable and secure in our county.” The measure that was approved calls for a hand-count audit in all precincts to be organized by the county recorder or other elections official to assure agreement with the machine count. McIntyre also called that plan unlawful.</p>

The County Board members had previously discussed the issue at their last meeting, and had heard from some members of the public who requested hand counting of the ballots. County commissioner Tom Loveall said he believed the machines did an accurate job, but in order to show they did, he made a motion to do both machine counting and hand counting at the next election, with the machine count being the official tally. His motion died for lack of a second, and no other motions were brought forward, so the voting machines will be used in this next election as usual.</p>

Officers stationed at schools and senior living communities acting as polling places would be required to be in plain clothes under amendments to bills approved unanimously by the Assembly Oversight, Reform, and Federal Relations Committee. An earlier version of the bills required plainclothes officers only at senior living communities. The changes are the latest part of lawmakers’ efforts to pare back a law that bars police from polling places, with few exceptions. That bill, which Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law in January, allows officers to be deployed to a senior residential center if the community reports a threat or safety concern and requests police presence. The legislation advanced would eliminate the threat threshold, meaning schools and senior living communities hosting voting can request police to be stationed there even in the absence of a threat.</p>

The brief, filed by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, draws parallels to the checks and balances of the federal government — especially Congress — as a clear indication that the so-called independent state legislature theory runs afoul of the Constitution. The senators argue that while the Constitution grants state legislatures the responsibility of setting the time, location and manner of federal elections, the Constitution also requires state legislatures to follow the same procedures when making rules for federal elections that they use to make other state laws. The clause, they write, “does not allow state legislatures to bypass the same restrictions imposed by state constitutions — the very documents that create and empower them.” Set to be heard in December, that case,<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/21-1271.html"> Moore v. Harper</a>, involves a congressional map drawn by the Republican-led legislature that was rejected by the state’s Supreme Court as a partisan gerrymander. Republican lawmakers sued, arguing that the court had no authority to reject the map. The North Carolina Republicans have argued that the clause means state legislatures alone are responsible for drawing congressional districts, and the courts have no role to play. Additionally, a group of current and former elections officials<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1271/243983/20221026130615201_Moore%20v%20Harper%20--%20Amici%20Brief%20of%20Current%20and%20Former%20Election%20Administrators%20%20FINAL.pdf"> filed an amicus brief</a> this week. The brief, in part, argues that, “If this Court were to decide that state legislatures have exclusive authority to set the rules in federal elections, and that federal courts are the arbiters of what those state rules mean and how they apply in federal races, the consequences would be profound. State and local election administrators need a single authoritative interpretation of state election law. Yet under petitioners’ “independent state legislature” (ISL) claim, the same state statute could be construed and enforced in three different ways—one by state courts subject to state constitutional constraints (for state elections); the next by federal courts applying their own views on what the statute means and how it should apply (for federal elections); and finally (and definitively) by a House of Congress in resolving a federal election contest. But these are the same concurrent federal-state elections governed by the same rules administered by the same officials with respect to the same ballots cast by the same voters. Embracing petitioners’ claim would wreak havoc on concurrent federal-state elections and could result in States having to conduct federal and state elections separately under different rules…”</p>

The five justices issued a brief order at the time in favor of the new system that was narrowly approved by voters in a 2020 ballot measure. It was issued quickly to confirm to the Alaska Division of Elections that the new voting system would be used this year. In their<a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23170785/sp-7629.pdf"> 57-page opinion</a>, the justices said that the tabulation process would still result in a gubernatorial candidate winning with the greatest number of votes — unless in the unlikely result of a tie — and that “there is no question that a ranked-choice vote is a single vote.” They also rejected arguments that an open primary burdens political parties’ right to choose their own candidates. Instead, it merely narrows the field of candidates by allowing the top four vote-getters, regardless of party, to advance to the general election, they said.</p>

<p>An association for retirees and an organization for Latino voters are seeking a<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/temporary-restraining-order-sought-against-group-linked-to-voter-intimidation-allegations-in-arizona/"> temporary restraining order</a> against a group they allege is coordinating a campaign of voter intimidation in Arizona. The restraining order request was filed Monday evening with a federal court lawsuit alleging that the group Clean Elections USA and its founder, Melody Jennings, were running afoul of federal law with incidents near ballot drop box locations in Arizona.  The lawsuit accuses the defendants of a &#8220;coordinated campaign of vigilante voter intimidation&#8221; in violation of the Voting Rights Act and federal civil rights law.</p>
<p>A federal lawsuit by the League of Women Voters of Arizona is<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/10/25/two-lawsuits-filed-to-stop-intimidation-at-ballot-drop-boxes/"> aiming to stop extremist groups from surveilling drop boxes</a> in Maricopa and Yavapai and counties.  The nonprofit Protect Democracy Project is representing the League of Women Voters of Arizona in the case. It seeks to bar three groups — the Arizona chapter of the Oath Keepers, the Yavapai County-based Lions of Liberty and Clean Elections USA, which is run by QAnon linked Melody Jennings — from continuing to surveil drop boxes.  The case accuses the groups of violating the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voter intimidation, and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which outlaws conspiring to “prevent, by force, intimidation, or threat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote, from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner.”</p>

The federal panel tossed some of the constitutional claims in the lawsuit challenging the redistricting plan approved by the majority-Republican Legislature last year. The lawsuit filed by two Black Democratic lawmakers and four other residents claimed the new map violates the Constitution and the federal Voting Rights Act by moving 23,000 predominantly Black voters out of the 2nd District in central Arkansas. Those voters were split between the state’s 1st and 4th congressional districts. The ruling gave the residents 30 days to file an amended complaint focusing on their remaining claims that the new map violates the Constitution and the federal Voting Rights Act. The lawsuit had claimed the new map diluted Black voters&#8217; influence. “What we can say at this stage is that the plaintiffs are a few specific factual allegations short of pleading a plausible vote-dilution claim,&#8221; the judges&#8217; ruling said. The judges also dismissed Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson and the state of Arkansas as defendants in the lawsuit.</p>

Wood was facing up to five years in prison and $5,000 in fines and fees, for allegedly illegally voting in the 2020 election. The judge found that the statewide prosecutor did not have jurisdiction over one case in Miami. Statewide prosecutors, which are an extension of the Attorney General&#8217;s office, are prosecuting all of the election fraud cases that were brought in August. The judge agreed with the defense&#8217;s argument that the alleged violations, applying to vote and voting while ineligible, only occurred in Miami-Dade County. Thus, the statewide prosecutor was found to not have jurisdiction. The ruling by a Miami judge may now pave the way for similar motions and rulings in the other 19 election fraud cases, which garnered national attention and controversy when they were announced on Aug. 18.</p>

Approximately 3,200 mail-in ballots were sent to voters in Dennis from the town clerk&#8217;s office last week incorrectly labeling Democrat Chris Flanagan as the candidate for reelection in the 1st Barnstable state representative race, Deb O&#8217;Malley, communications director for the Secretary of the Commonwealth&#8217;s office told the Times. The 1st Barnstable state representative seat is currently held by Rep. Timothy Whelan, R-Brewster, who is not seeking reelection. Whelan, instead, is running for the Barnstable County sheriff. Dennis Town Clerk Theresa Bunce was able to intercept 600 of these ballots, but approximately 2,600 ballots reached voters incorrectly, labeling Flanagan as the incumbent, O&#8217;Malley said. Voters were given the option to send in the second corrected ballot, she added, but if they had already mailed in the first ballot and did not mail in the second ballot, the original ballot would be counted. Post filed a complaint on Oct. 18 in Barnstable Superior Court seeking an injunction on counting the original ballots, alleging they were defective and counting them would violate election laws. Gildea denied Post&#8217;s request for an injunction on the grounds that the commonwealth secretary&#8217;s office and the Dennis town clerk acted on the error, and that there is no evidence that the incident would impact Post&#8217;s chances at the polls. &#8220;Ms. Post suggests that this court has a unique opportunity to act before a complete injustice occurs in an election, rather than after,&#8221; Gildea said in his opinion. &#8220;The facts of this case do not warrant mandamus relief and I do not find that Ms. Post has shown a likelihood of success of succeeding on the merits of her claim.&#8221;</p>

Benson and Brater &#8220;exceeded their authority with respect to certain provisions&#8221; in the challenger manual, Swartzle wrote.

The ruling came in response to an emergency petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, which challenged several aspects of Nye County’s plan to start hand-counting votes next week. The ACLU said<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-lawsuits-nevada-voting-statutes-ff520369557bdb0e0b46f3b0bd25e9f5"> in its lawsuit</a> that the plan risked leaking early voting results. It also said rules on touch screens to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act were too vague and restrictive, and that the county violated state law with its “stringent signature verification” for voter ID. Friday’s ruling — which was largely but not completely in favor of the ACLU — said that observers of the public hand-count must sign a form promising not to disclose information about the early voting results before the official results are released. Observers “are likely to learn election result information before the release of such information is statutorily authorized,” the justices wrote.  The justices also modified Nye County’s signature verification process to allow voters more options to verify who they are if their signature doesn’t match what’s on their voter forms.</p>

The ruling did not, however, invalidate hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots already in the hands of New York voters as Republicans asked the judge to do — at least not for now. In her 28-page ruling, Freestone said she believes a law allowing anyone to vote absentee if they’re fearful of spreading an illness — a provision approved by the state Legislature in August 2020 and extended in January of this year — is also unconstitutional. But the judge concluded she was bound by prior court precedent that already allowed it to stand. “The framers of the Constitution did not intend to grant (and did not grant) the Legislature carte blanche to enact legislation over absentee voting,” Freestone wrote. Senate Democrats and Assembly Democrats immediately appealed the ruling, which could draw a stay that would temporarily block Freestone’s order from taking effect. The state has<a href="https://www.syracuse.com/state/2022/10/new-york-state-officials-appeal-absentee-ballot-rule-with-election-looming.html"> appealed the ruling</a>.</p>

The men were indicted in 2020 after they were accused of using the robocalls to intimidate residents in minority neighborhoods to refrain from voting by mail at a time when many voters were reluctant to cast ballots in person because of the coronavirus pandemic. The calls also claimed that the government could use mail-in voting information to track people for mandatory vaccination programs, prosecutors said. “These individuals infringed upon the right to vote, which is one of the most fundamental components of our democracy,” the Cuyahoga County prosecutor, Michael C.

Capehart has ruled that Lehigh County can<a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/judge-in-person-monitoring-not-required-at-lehigh-county-ballot-drop-off-boxes/"> deploy ballot drop-off boxes without assigning staff to check</a> whether people deposit more than one ballot. Capehart said there is no need for anyone to personally monitor drop boxes. He said they are under constant video surveillance, adding that monitors “may unduly interfere with voters lawfully returning ballots.” The suit referenced an investigation by Republican District Attorney Jim Martin based on video surveillance in the November 2021 election. Martin found at least 288 instances where people dropped off more than one ballot contrary to state law. People are limited to depositing only one ballot unless authorized to do so by another voter. That prompted Martin to send county detectives to monitor activity at the county’s five ballot box locations in the May 18 primary. Capehart referenced testimony in an Oct. 7 hearing on the case by Martin, who said he found no evidence of voter fraud involving mail-in ballot drop boxes in the May 18 primary when county detectives monitored activity. “Further, any alleged harm appears to be speculative,” Capehart, a Republican elected in 2021, wrote.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said late last week it will<a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/pa-supreme-court-will-consider-whether-postal-ballots-without-dates-should-be-counted/"> consider whether election officials should count votes cast by voters who fail to put a handwritten date on their mail-in or absentee ballots.</a> In a two-page order, it directed Republican Party officials to file briefs by noon on Monday and gave acting Secretary of State Lehigh Chapman until noon on Tuesday to respond.  The order comes a little more than two weeks before the Nov. 8 election where voters will choose Pennsylvania’s next governor, U.S. Senator, and hundreds of state lawmakers. The subject of litigation since no-excuse mail-in voting became an option for Pennsylvania residents in 2020, the question of whether lawmakers intended for ballots returned without the date on the outer envelope remains unsettled. The Supreme Court ordered the parties to limit their briefs to three issues: Whether the Republican Party-backed voters have standing to sue, whether the Election Code’s instruction that voters “shall … date” mail-in and absentee ballot means those without dates should not be counted, and if that is the case, does the law run afoul of ballot access provisions in the federal Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p>In other state Supreme Court news, the high court<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-ballots-notice-cure-supreme-court-20221021.html"> deadlocked</a> on the issue of whether county elections officials may help voters cure their ballots. The high court normally has seven members, but Chief Justice Max Baer died last month. Of the remaining six members, Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty, and David Wecht said they agreed with the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court’s decision that allowed ballot curing to continue. Chief Justice Debra Todd and Justices Sallie Updyke Mundy and Kevin Brobson said they would have reversed it. The three-sentence order dealt a defeat to the Republican National Committee and other GOP groups, which had filed the appeal in one of the latest fronts in the state’s contentious partisan battle over which ballots should be counted.</p>

As of Saturday afternoon, the Hidalgo County website still doesn’t list the Peñitas Public Library as a polling location. The county has appealed the decision and now an appellate court is reviewing the matter.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/Appeals-court-upholds-voter-registration-17536930.php"> revived a 2021 law that set new residency requirements for voter registration</a>, including one that civil rights groups alleged essentially blocked college students from signing up. The panel overturned a lower court’s ruling that blocked most of the law for creating an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote. The judges found the groups, LULAC and Voto Latino, failed to prove they had endured harm as a result of the law and therefore lacked standing. Senate Bill 1111, which took effect Sept. 1 of last year, requires that anyone using a P.O. Box to register must also provide documentation of a physical residential address, such as a photocopy of a driver’s license. It also prohibits voters from establishing or maintaining a residence “for the purpose of influencing the outcome of a certain election.” Lastly, it bars voters from establishing a residence in a place they have not inhabited or at a previous residence, unless they live there at the time of the designation and intend to remain there. U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel mostly left the P.O. Box provision in-tact, reasoning that the state has an interest in preventing voter registration fraud and the request for verification of a physical address is not a severe burden. A response to that request with a new address, Yeakel clarified, should be considered a change of address with no further action needed. Yeakel had enjoined the two other provisions. He argued that there are valid reasons for changing an address that may influence the outcome of an election but not in a malicious way, such as “voting, volunteering with a political campaign, or running for an elected office.” The final provision relating to where a person lives or intends to stay would make registration near-impossible for college students, senators or other groups of people who live in multiple locations throughout the year, Yeakel said.</p>

A year after that, Rogers was arrested and charged with a felony after the Texas Attorney General’s office argued Rogers was prohibited from casting a ballot because he was on parole. Rogers was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 1995 for burglary and intent to commit theft. He was released on parole in May 2004, and his parole was set to end in June 2020. The charges were dropped after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals<a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/paxton-asks-court-criminal-appeals-reverse-its-decision-stripping-oag-authority-stop-election-fraud"> ruled</a> earlier this year that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton cannot unilaterally prosecute alleged election crimes.</p>

The judge rejected allowing a temporary injunction, which would have forced the City of Milwaukee’s GOTV efforts as a case played out in court, writing that “The issuance of a temporary injunction would impermissibly chill constitutionally protected speech.”</p>
<p>Dane County Circuit Court Judge Nia Trammell rejected an emergency request to allow election clerks to count absentee ballots with<a href="https://www.wpr.org/dane-county-judge-rejects-request-let-clerks-count-absentee-ballots-incomplete-witness-addresses"> incomplete witness address</a> information. The request came from the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin. The group filed a lawsuit against the Wisconsin Elections Commission in late September in hopes the court would clarify state statutes barring clerks from counting absentee ballots if envelopes, known as witness certificates, are &#8220;missing the address&#8221; of that individual.  Legal arguments in the case focused on the meaning of the word &#8220;missing&#8221; in the statute governing absentee ballots. In an oral ruling, Trammell said parties requesting injunctions must prove, among other things, that they are &#8220;necessary to preserve the status quo.&#8221;  &#8220;I believe that to issue a temporary injunction would upend the status quo, not preserve it,&#8221; said Trammell. &#8220;I also believe that the fact that the election is all but two weeks away lends some credence to the argument raised by WEC and the Legislature that any decision issued by the court granting the temporary injunction would frustrate the electoral process by causing confusion.&#8221;</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/s/democracys-frontline-election-/1476426639532925/">Democracy’s Frontline: Election Administration the State of Our Union</a>: Co-presented by Issue One and the documentary film No Time To Fail. In partnership with the League of Women Voters and Election Hero Day. Once invisible to the general public, election workers across the country are under threat as they work around the clock to secure the vote for their community. Despite the challenges of a global pandemic and desperate attempts to disrupt the 2020 election, they pulled off the most secure election in our history. Rather than receiving a hero’s welcome, they have become the focus of an ongoing coordinated campaign of disinformation, with 1 in 5 election officials likely to quit prior to the 2024 election season (source: Brennan Center of Justice). This expert roundtable event brings together those at the forefront of election administration to discuss critical issues facing these stewards of democracy as we face the midterm elections: Jocelyn Benson – Michigan Secretary of State; Al Schmidt – Former City Commissioner of Philadelphia; Tiana Epps-Johnson – Founder and Executive Director, The Center for Tech and Civic Life; and Tommy Gong – Deputy County Clerk-Recorder for Contra Costa County and member of the Coalition of Bay Area Election Officials. <strong>When:</strong> October 27 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://kinema.com/events/national-virtual-screening-frr8we">No Time to Fail Virtual Screening</a>: Amidst an onslaught of attacks from a sitting President and the deadly threat of a global pandemic, local election administrators work around the clock to secure the vote for their community. Rhode Island’s election teams take center stage in this unprecedented voting adventure. <strong>When:</strong> October 27, 5pm Eastern <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://voteearlyday.org/">Vote Early Day</a>: Vote Early Day is a nonpartisan movement of media companies, businesses, nonprofits, election administrators, and creatives working to ensure all Americans have the tools to vote early. This holiday is a tentpole moment for partners of all stripes to engage with voters and urge them to cast their ballots. Created in 2020, Vote Early Day has brought thousands of national and local partners together in celebration and activation to increase the number of people voting early. This collaborative, open-source model—similar to Giving Tuesday and National Voter Registration Day—ensures that millions more Americans take advantage of their options to vote early through on the ground activations, get-out-the-vote pushes, national communications on traditional and social media, and efforts to create a new culture around voting. Vote Early Day plays a unique role in the push to get voters to cast their ballot. We are a trusted, nonpartisan holiday with supporters on both sides of the aisle. We provide a central moment for a wide range of partners (many non- traditional to the civic space) to engage with voters and urge them to vote early. Our collaboration of thousands of diverse partners allows us to engage in places beyond where voters are used to seeing election messages. This allows us to break through the noise and meet voters where they are. <strong>When:</strong> October 28</p>
<p><a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/register-2022-post-election-webinar">MEDSL 2022 Post-Election Webinar</a>: On December 8, the MIT Election Data &amp; Science Lab will be hosting a public webinar all about the 2022 election, featuring our own takes on what happened as well as highlighting other researchers&#8217; work and what they saw. From what happened online to what happened in polling places, we&#8217;ll cover as much as we can. Register today to hold your spot and receive more details about the event! <strong>Where:</strong> Online <strong>When:</strong> December 8</p>
