														<p><strong>Entrance Interview</strong><br />
<em>NJ’s Tahesha Way becomes first Black leader of NASS</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Eletionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8592" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TaheshaWay-278x300.png" alt="" width="278" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TaheshaWay-278x300.png 278w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TaheshaWay.png 432w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" />Recently, the members of the<a href="https://www.nass.org/"> National Association of Secretaries of State </a>(NASS) selected Tahesha Way,<a href="https://www.state.nj.us/state/index.shtml"> New Jersey’s secretary of state</a>, as president of the associ­ation. In NASS’s 118-year history, Way is the first Black person to hold this post.</p>
<p>Way comes into the role at a time when elections officials at all levels are facing unprecedented challenges…after two years of challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am honored to be the first Black woman to serve as NASS President. This organization’s non­partisan work has never been more critical representing the nation’s guardians of democracy,” Way in a<a href="https://www.nass.org/node/2439"> statement</a>.</p>
<p>During her time with NASS, Way has served on the Election Infrastructure Subsector Govern­ment Coordinating Council (EIS-GCC), as well as the co-chair of NASS’s State Heritage and International Relations Committees. Additionally, in December 2019, she participated in a<a href="https://www.nass.org/node/1768"> NASS Israel delegation</a> to discuss cybersecurity, election administration and more.</p>
<p>Way was first appointed by Gov. Phil Murphy in December 2017 and sworn in as New Jersey’s 34th secretary of state in February. 2018. He renominated her in 2021 and she was once sworn in earlier this year.</p>
<p>“Tahesha has done an exemplary job as our Secretary of State since 2018, and I am proud to renominate her to continue serving the people of New Jersey,” said Governor Phil Murphy in a<a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562022/20220111c.shtml"> statement</a>. “Under Tahesha’s leadership the Secretary of State’s Office oversaw the unprecedented primarily vote-by-mail 2020 election, updated election infrastructure to improve election security, worked to achieve a complete count for New Jersey in the 2020 Census&#8230;. I am confident that Tahesha and her team will continue working diligently during our second term to realize the multi-faceted mission of the Department of State.”</p>
<p><em><strong>1) You were first appointed to your role as New Jersey secretary of state in 2018 and then reconfirmed this summer. Why were you interested in being secretary of state in the first place and what kept you in the job when Gov. Murphy chose to reappoint you?<br />
</strong></em>I love the entire portfolio of Secretary of State. While the role varies by state, here in New Jersey, I oversee a Department that includes the Division of Elections, Division of Travel and Tourism, the Business Action Center, the State Council on the Arts, the Motion Picture Commission, the State Museum, the New Jersey-Israel Commission, and that’s not even a full list! Every day is different and it’s exciting to see the many ways State employees impact the lives of the people of New Jersey. Of course, I have been immensely proud to lead the Department during a time of great change for our voters. Over the last few years, we have conducted elections using millions of mail ballots, added in person early voting as an option, and expanded the electorate. I’m grateful that Governor Murphy demonstrated his trust in my leadership by reappointing me this year. I’m really looking forward to spending the next few years supporting greater civic engagement in our communities and growing people’s understanding of how our elections work.</p>
<p><em><strong>2) Although you’ve been an elected official, this is your first stint as an elections official. What’s one thing you’ve learned about elections during your tenure that surprised you and what’s one thing (maybe the same thing, maybe not) that you wish more people knew about elections?<br />
</strong></em>As an elected official, I was accustomed to “Election Season,” essentially the time between Labor Day and Election Day when campaigns are in full swing, and the voters are really paying attention. I knew our election officials worked hard, but I didn’t have an appreciation for the fact that this work is constant throughout the year. I now see firsthand that every election takes weeks, months and even years of planning, and that the work never ends because we are always taking what we learned in the last election and applying that lesson to the next election. It’s important the public understands how our different levels of government, from our county election partners on up through federal law enforcement, work together to ensure every election is free and fair.</p>
<p><em><strong>3) You were recently elected to serve as the president of NASS. Given the current electionscenvironment, why did you want to take on such a public role&#8211;more public than being New Jersey’s secretary of state, which is admittedly pretty public?<br />
</strong></em>Given the current environment, how could I NOT take on such a public role? Americans need to see us putting the voters first and standing up for free and fair elections. I’m honored my peers from across the country have entrusted me to lead this historic, nonpartisan association, especially this year. I’m proud to step up and be a leader at a time when citizens need someone in their corner, now more than ever.</p>
<p><em><strong>5) You’re the first Black woman to serve as president of NASS and one of the few statewide elections officials who is Black, what would you recommend the field do to help diversify itself not only at the state level, but also the local level, both in race and gender?<br />
</strong></em>We need to build a bigger, more diverse bench of election officials at every level. We need to see America’s rich diversity reflected in all our public servants, but especially those serving as poll workers, as municipal clerks, or working in county election offices. This is how we will help the next generation build the credentials and experience they need to be the election leaders of tomorrow. I may be the first Black person to lead NASS, but I won’t be the last. It’s my hope that a young Black woman will see me serving in this role and recognize that there is space for her, and everyone else regardless of race or gender, in this field.</p>
<p><em><strong>6) It’s been a rough few years for elections officials and unfortunately looks to continue. What advice do you have for officials both at the state and local level to get through all of this?<br />
</strong></em>First, no one should be made to feel unsafe because of their profession. Election workers perform truly essential work for our democracy and none of them should be facing threats for doing their jobs. I want election workers to remember you are not alone. Thousands of workers from across the country are facing many of the same challenges and experiencing the same tumultuous climate. In New Jersey, my team at the Division of Elections and I work closely with our local and county election officials, and they know that we have their backs. This issue is also top of mind for all levels of law enforcement, including our federal partners who are working with us to protect election workers. I would encourage election officials to remember that when we work together and communicate with one another, we can keep each other and our democracy safe.</p>

							<h2>Essential Guide to Election Security</h2>
														<p><strong>Handbook becomes essential guide</strong><br />
<em>CIS/EI-ISAC update 2018 handbook for current election security needs</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5640" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-300x77.png" alt="" width="300" height="77" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-300x77.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo-768x197.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CISLogo.png 820w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />With just 3 months until the 2022 midterm elections, candidates are campaigning and election officials are working hard to prepare…but so are adversaries intent on disrupting the election process. How can election officials stay ahead of the threat?</p>
<p>Enter the <a href="https://docs.cisecurity.org/en/latest/">Essential Guide to Election Security</a>. Created by the <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/">Center for Internet Security </a>and the <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/ei-isac">Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center</a> (EI-ISAC), it guides officials through the process of securing elections against an overwhelming majority of attacks. The EI-ISAC recognizes that not every jurisdiction has the same level of cybersecurity experience, and is committed to assisting even the most under-resourced election offices in building programs to meet their needs.</p>
<p>“Implementing effective election security practices is critical for our democracy. It can also feel overwhelming for officials who may not have cybersecurity staff or training,” said Kathy Boockvar, Vice President of Election Operations &amp; Support at the Center for Internet Security.</p>
<p>“This is why we created the <a href="https://docs.cisecurity.org/en/latest/">Essential Guide to Election Security</a>—our new, easy-to-access resource that meets election offices where they are. The Essential Guide breaks down its recommendations into 3 levels, so everyone from beginners to experts will find election security guidance and best practices that fit their jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>Significantly, the Essential Guide to Election Security meets election offices where they are with prioritized best practices based on data of attacks that have occurred in the real world. It breaks down recommendations, which are based on<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/white-papers/cis-community-defense-model-2-0"> CIS Community Defense Model (CDM) v2.0</a>, into three levels so everyone from beginners to experts can find guidance that fits their jurisdictions. This makes the Essential Guide relevant to protecting against real-world attacks including physical security threats, intimidation, and doxing.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Essential Guide includes three levels of maturity. Not all election offices have the same resources or technical capabilities, so we needed to find a way to give guidance that meets the officials where they are. By including different maturity levels, the Essential Guide gives election officials different paths of implementation for any given best practice.</p>
<p>Visit our <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/a-new-beginning-for-election-security-journeys">blog</a> for a behind-the-scenes look at what went into creating the guide, and some of the new challenges it addresses.</p>

							<h2>Cybersecurity Toolkit to Protect Elections</h2>
														<p><strong>CISA releases toolkit of free cybersecurity resources for election community</strong><br />
<em>Tools build on existing efforts to help state and local election officials protect against ransomware, phishing, and DDoS attacks</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8713" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CISAToolkit-300x74.png" alt="" width="300" height="74" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CISAToolkit-300x74.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CISAToolkit-1024x254.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CISAToolkit-768x190.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CISAToolkit-1536x380.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CISAToolkit.png 1970w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released its <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-toolkit-protect-elections">“Protecting U.S. Elections: A CISA Cybersecurity Toolkit”</a> , a one-stop catalog of free services and tools available for state and local election officials to improve the cybersecurity and resilience of their infrastructure. As the lead federal agency responsible for election security, CISA regularly works with state and local election officials to secure their systems and offers a number of services, information products, and other resources.</p>
<p>This toolkit was developed through CISA’s Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), which worked with private and public sector organizations, including in the election community, and JCDC alliance members – to compile these free resources. The toolkit is organized into broad categories designed to help election officials:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assess their risk using an Election Security Risk Profile Tool developed by CISA and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission;</li>
<li>Find tools related to protecting voter information, websites, email systems, and networks; and</li>
<li>Protect assets against phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial-of-services (DDoS) attacks.</li>
</ol>
<p>“I am very proud to announce another valuable resource that can help officials further reduce their cyber risk and improve their security posture,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “Each day, state and local election officials confront threats to their infrastructure from foreign interference, nefarious actors, insider threats, and others. This is one more resource to help them in their ongoing efforts to ensure American elections remain secure and resilient.”</p>
<p>The toolkit is the latest resource that CISA and our partners have developed to support the election community. CISA’s website lists a number of resources and guidance on everything from cybersecurity to physical security for polling sites and election officials to combat mis-, dis-, and malinformation. The agency works with election officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the territories to regularly share timely and actionable information and intelligence, and provide cybersecurity services, technical assistance, and guidance.</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Six more states complete primaries</strong><br />
<em>Secretary of state races are closely watched</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Another six states recently held primaries. On Thursday August 4 it was Tennessee. On Saturday August 6  it was the U.S. Virgin Islands and finally on Tuesday August 9 it was Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>A lot of eyes were on the Tuesday primaries since three of the four states held contests for secretary of state. With the retirement of Denise Merrill in Connecticut and Jim Condos in Vermont, those states are guaranteed to see a new chief elections official in the new year.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.journalinquirer.com/news/rapini-and-thomas-win-primaries-for-secretary-of-the-state/article_5f319ec0-18a4-11ed-bb5f-6fb6ca08e6c1.html"> Connecticut</a>, Democrat Stephanie Thomas, a freshman legislator from Norwalk will face off against Republican Dominic Rapini, a marketing executive. In<a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/simon-crockett-advance-following-secretary-of-state-primary/"> Minnesota</a> incumbent Secretary of State Steve Simon (DFL) will face off against Republican Kim Crockett who is on the record as a 2020 election denier. In<a href="https://www.wamc.org/news/2022-08-10/vermont-voters-choose-lieutenant-governor-and-secretary-of-state-candidates-for-november-general-election"> Vermont</a>, Democrat Sarah Copeland Hanzas, a member of the Vermont Legislature will face off against Republican H. Brooke Paige and Progressive Robert Millar.</p>
<p>To clarify, and as most electionline readers know, the<a href="https://www.channel3000.com/secretary-of-state-republican-primary-results/"> Wisconsin</a> secretary of state does not have oversight of elections, although the state’s GOP is pushing a change that would eliminate the state’s election commission and put oversight under the state’s secretary of state. Given that, while we’ve not kept a super close eye on that race, it is important to know who the players will be in November and potentially beyond.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the news out of the past week’s primaries, they were all fairly business as usual. There were some issues with weather conditions in Connecticut and some voters in Tennessee were faced with long lines due a historically long ballot.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at what happened:</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5911" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CT-Welcome-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CT-Welcome-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CT-Welcome-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CT-Welcome.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Connecticut:</strong> Much of the East Coast has been sweltering this week and those temperatures definitely had an impact on voting Tuesday in Connecticut. Voting at hone<a href="https://we-ha.com/heat-causes-relocation-of-voting-at-king-philip-middle-school-in-west-hartford/"> West Hartford</a> polling place had to be moved to another location within the building because temperatures in the original room reached 95 degrees. “Due to the excessive heat it was a danger to the poll workers and the equipment,” Republican Registrar of Voters Beth Kyle said. While voters were in and out of the space within minutes, the workers – and the equipment – couldn’t escape the heat. A vote tabulator in<a href="https://www.fox61.com/article/news/politics/elections/vote-tabulator-overheats-middletown-connecticut-primary-polling-place-officials/520-4ba768f2-9e04-40a5-9fa4-f1b592ae059e"> Middletown</a> overheated. A vote tabulator at the Spencer School on Westfield Street has been malfunctioning due to the heat, according to the city&#8217;s Republican Register of Voters David Bauer. The school building is not air-conditioned. Voters in<a href="https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Primary-is-practice-for-new-voting-districts-in-17362646.php?src=sthpdesecp"> New Canaan</a> tested out new precincts and polling places on Tuesday without many known issues. In West Hartford, every voter got a<a href="https://we-ha.com/voter-turnout-light-on-primary-day-in-connecticut/"> pink postcard</a> in July with information about their new polling places and Republican Registrar of Voters Beth Kyle said there hadn’t been reported complaints about people not knowing where to vote. “We will send out another mailing before the November election,” Kyle said. A recount will decide the 127th District Democratic primary  in<a href="https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Brown-declares-victory-in-CT-primary-race-for-17363413.php"> Bridgeport</a> after unofficial election results showed the two candidates separated by just five votes.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5666" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MN-Welcome-300x197.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MN-Welcome-300x197.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MN-Welcome-768x505.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MN-Welcome.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Minnesota:</strong> Final counts from Minnesota’s primary election on Tuesday are yet to be certified, but Secretary of State Steve Simon said voter<a href="https://www.brainerddispatch.com/news/minnesota/early-count-shows-strong-but-not-record-breaking-turnout-in-minnesota-primary"> turnout</a> appeared to be &#8220;relatively strong&#8221; compared to other years. Voters in<a href="https://www.keyc.com/2022/08/09/minnesota-voters-find-new-polling-places/"> North Mankato</a> seemed to have few problems finding their new, post-redistricting polling places. Election judges were pretty happy about them too. ”This place is inviting, it’s new, it’s bigger, there are plenty of places to park and plenty of room for us to set up all of the equipment,” election judge Mary Clare Wyrowski said. “So we have gone from maybe one of the saddest polling places to one of the happiest polling places.” Voters in<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/blue-earth-county-debuts-polling-112000406.html"> Blue Earth County</a> also faced new polling places with little issue. Sisters Kao Yong Yang and Yong Cheng Yang served as first-time election judges in<a href="https://ccxmedia.org/news/hmong-sisters-serve-as-first-time-election-judges-in-brooklyn-center/"> Brooklyn Park</a> and talked about how they enjoyed the process, despite the 15-hour-day. “There’s also a lot of Hmong voters so, if I can come and in case someone needs to speak Hmong or interpreting, then I could step up,” Yong Cheng Yang said. “And yeah, it’s actually really fun. I enjoy it.” The sisters, immigrants from Thailand, especially enjoyed being able to help out the Hmong voters who needed a hand. “There was actually a Hmong couple that came in and they didn’t know English,” Yong Cheng Yang said. “So I was able to speak Hmong to them and direct them to where they needed to be.” A special election that was coupled with Tuesday’s primary in<a href="https://www.southernminn.com/owatonna_peoples_press/news/election-judge-of-20-years-says-aug-9-was-1st-for-unique-ballots/article_56917e22-181b-11ed-90c5-e336befc1ebe.html"> Steele County</a> had election judges giving out special instructions to voters. “It’s definitely an interesting ballot,” Deloris Slack, head judge for Owatonna Ward 5 Precinct 1 said. “The judges giving out the ballots have had to give more instructions this time around.” A race decided by three votes for<a href="https://knsiradio.com/2022/08/10/recount-in-st-cloud-city-council-ward-2-race/"> St. Cloud</a> City Council will require a recount. Controversy erupted in the town of<a href="https://www.postbulletin.com/news/local/rochester-mayor-spurs-questions-as-byron-election-judge"> Byron</a> where Rochester Mayor Kim Norton was serving as an elections judge. State statute does not prohibit someone serving as an election official in a precinct where they do not appear on the ballot. “Byron is always in search of people willing and able to serve as an election judge and have completed the required training,” Janna Monosmith, Byron’s interim city administrator said. “Kim was treated the same as any other person working an election and is working where she is needed.”</p>

In<a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/long-ballots-meant-45-minutes-spent-in-voting-booths-election-lines-stretched-out-for-hours-in-nashville"> Davidson County</a>. But it wasn’t turnout that slowed the process—the county was prepared for 100,000 voters and only about 70,000 voted—it was the length of the ballot that slowed things down. “The length of the ballot really hampered the flow,&#8221; said Elections Administrator Jeff Roberts. The ballot was so long that in some cases, voters spent 45 minutes in the booth trying to make their selections, according to Roberts. &#8220;Some of the places where they had lines that were an hour long, they only voted 200 people all day,&#8221; he said. While his office has about 20 extra voting machines they can send to the busiest areas, that can only help so much.  &#8220;We’re never going to have an unlimited number of machines we can deploy, because we only have a finite number,&#8221; said Roberts. Voters in<a href="https://www.dnj.com/story/news/2022/08/04/where-vote-rutherford-county-tn-election-day/10231098002/"> Rutherford County</a> also faced long lines, but not due to any technical issue. In this county, it was also the length of the ballot that was slowing down many voters.  In<a href="https://dailymemphian.com/section/metroelections/article/30156/shelby-county-general-election-day-turnout-starts-slow"> Shelby County</a>, results weren’t posted till about 1 a.m. after some voting equipment was brought to the operations center at Shelby Farms without running and posting a tape of the results at the precinct because of paper jams in the election equipment. The only issues in<a href="https://www.heraldandtribune.com/featured-news/election-commission-eyes-voter-turnout-with-concern/"> Washington County</a> were concerns low turnout will have on the county long-term. Poll workers in<a href="https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/claiborne-hancock-grainger-union/union-county-voter-voting-election-day-east-tennessee-knoxville/51-dc017dea-2f30-47e2-bd3f-37815da092db"> Union County</a> were forced to turn to paper ledgers after ID readers at polling places stopped working.  There were no lines and no problems reported as hundreds of<a href="https://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/2022/08/04/clarksville-voters-head-polls-decide-local-tennessee-races/10167605002/"> Montgomery County</a> residents flocked to the polls to cast their ballots in the state primary and local county elections. Beverly Guinn, a precinct officer told the Leaf Chronicle the biggest issue her polling place faced was an issue every American faces these days, finding enough outlets and extension cords to  plug in equipment. The Tennessee Lookout<a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/08/04/increased-threats-to-poll-workers-across-country-havent-dampened-enthusiasm-in-tennessee/"> had a story about poll workers</a> and how despite the threats, the enthusiasm for serving hadn’t been dampened in the appropriately nicknamed Volunteer State. The state rolled out a<a href="https://www.wjhl.com/news/your-local-election-hq/tennessee-rolls-out-new-text-option-to-report-voter-fraud/"> new text system</a> for voters to send concerns and tips about voting fraud. Secretary of State Tre Hargett told a local television station that by around 1pm on primary day they had yet to receive a text.</p>

Elections Board member Alicia Wells praised Elections Supervisor Caroline Fawkes and her deputies, Terrell Alexandre on St. Croix and Kevermay Douglas on St. Thomas. They and the other Elections System workers who organized the primary “did a wonderful job,” Wells said. Polling Judge Karen Blyden has been manning elections for more than 20 years, told the The Virgin Islands Daily News that the process went smoothly, other than some voters’ confusion about the primary ballot — which included only Democrats running for the same offices, not candidates from the independent, ICM, and Republican parties, who the primary winners will face in the general election on Nov. 8. Voters on St. Thomas and St. John expressed interest and support for the Voter Express<a href="https://stthomassource.com/content/2022/08/06/primary-voters-trickle-into-voting-centers-on-st-thomas-st-john/"> voting system</a> that allowed them to cast their ballots electronically. At UVI, almost all of the partitioned tables remained unused, while Voter Express machines that ringed the area saw voters tapping away. While voting went smoothly, there was a delay with the new system in posting results. Chairman of the Board of Elections Raymond J. Williams thanks Virgin Islanders for voting and their patience waiting for results and vowed that they would continue to streamline the process to<a href="https://stthomassource.com/content/2022/08/10/board-of-elections-chairman-apologizes-for-delay-in-publishing-full-primary-election-results/"> get results posted more quickly</a>.</p>

Although official numbers are still pending,<a href="https://www.wcax.com/2022/08/10/vt-primary-draws-an-estimated-130k-voters/"> turnout</a> in The Green Mountain State was up from the 2018 midterm primary with about 26.5% of Vermonters casting ballots this week.

More than a third of city voters were assigned new polling places. City Clerk Henry Heck actively sought publicity ahead of the election and stationed a worker at each polling place with a map and chart showing people where to go. Ward Clerk Beth Kiernan had put out a candy dish to help ease tensions with misplaced voters. “We’ve had some frustrated people,” she said. “Most people have been polite. Most people have been confused why. I guess they just didn’t hear about it.”<a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/south-burlington-sees-big-voter-turnout-at-some-polling-locations/40851700"> South Burlington</a> tested out new tabulators.

The potential of voter intimidation and harassment is a grave concern to 39% of Black people and 38% of Hispanic people compared to 19% of white people. Meanwhile, 24% of white people, 44% of Black people and 45% of Hispanic people expressed concern about a violent attack or shooting on Election Day. GPAHE&#8217;s survey did not include data on Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders or Indigenous people. This poll surveyed a demographically representative sample of 1,003 U.S. adults 18 years of age and older. The online omnibus study was conducted three times a week from July 22 to 24.</p>

An election official accidentally moved a tray of 188 absentee ballots before they had been processed, which meant they were never cast or counted, according to the review. The mistake was determined to be unintentional, and while it didn’t change the outcome of the election, the Attorney General’s Office considers it a serious error.  “It was a demanding election,” said Myles Matteson, who is deputy general counsel in the Attorney General’s Election Law Unit. “Election officials were working hard under difficult circumstances to administer a fair, transparent, and efficient election given all of the voters that were participating, many for the first time and difficult circumstances related to COVID.” The Secretary of State’s Office will appoint the election monitor after consulting with the attorney general. “Nothing in the actual occurrence of the ballots not being counted or in our interaction with the election officials indicated that anyone had any intent to not count these ballots,” Matteson said.</p>

According to the Houston Chronical, some officials believe a a brightly colored insert that arrives with mail ballots, explaining the new requirements and showing the easily forgotten space under the flap of the return envelope where the voter’s ID number needs to be printed is just the fix needed. Bexar County Elections Administrator Jacque Callanen  said the insert is small enough and positioned in such a way that it will likely fall to the floor when voters open the mail ballot packet, so they can’t miss it. She said her office used the inserts in May primary runoff elections and saw immediate results. “We had under a 1 percent reject rate,” Callanen said. “We were back to where we belonged, which was a dance of joy.” Sam Taylor, a spokesman for the secretary of state, said the inserts “appeared to make a difference.” Taylor said elections officials across the state learned about the inserts and other best practices during an election law seminar the agency held at the beginning of this month. Harris County election officials said this week they are including a new insert about voter ID requirements with their mail ballot applications, and adding voter ID information to an existing insert with mail ballots, for November&#8217;s general election.</p>

JCPL Adult Services Manager Lisa Krekelberg said the library is hosting this event because people often ask library staff for voting and election information. “People ask us all the time where they can find details about upcoming elections. It can be difficult to find this information, especially for local elections,” Krekelberg said. Elections Administrator Dana Jones will show people how to find the information they need before going to the voting booth, including who is running, who has picked up petitions for offices and which offices are elected. “It’s fascinating to learn how our elections work,” Krekelberg said. “Several years ago, I volunteered at a polling location, and that experience helped me understand how much work goes into an election. I’m excited to hear from Dana Jones about our election process.”</p>

Seven cities and towns had local races left off early ballots that required the county to mail about 63,000 supplemental ballots. And County Attorney Kent Volkmer told the board that four other municipalities were affected by Election Day missteps that led to ballot shortages at about 20 of the county&#8217;s 95 polling places. “As the county manager clearly indicated, we fell below the expectations of our customers,” Volkmer told the board. “So I believe if this board is so inclined, I think there is good cause to waive for all of the various entities that we serve the municipal and town elections for.” “I think that’s a good idea due to the issues at hand,” Board Chair Jeffrey McClure. Last week, McClure had called the election issues “a major screwup&#8221; and Elections Director David Frisk was fired the next day. He had just been hired in March. Volkmer also said he was close to hiring an outside election expert to conduct a review. He said there was so far no sign of any criminal violations but that bringing in someone from outside would ensure that an unbiased assessment would be swiftly completed.</p>

The council received the petition during its July 18 meeting, unanimously approving the certificate of sufficiency issued by the city clerk’s office, meaning the signatures submitted in conjunction with the petition met the city’s requirement for a possible ballot initiative aimed at repealing the use of ranked-choice voting for city council elections. The next hurdle for the ballot proposal is a determination if the language submitted for the ballot initiative is acceptable. The amendments necessitated by the petition include restoring primary races to city council elections, which are eliminated under ranked-choice voting, cleaning up language related to candidate filing and election procedures and setting the approval of any future votes to institute ranked-choice voting at two-thirds of ballots cast.</p>

The city is considering a new ordinance that will make disorderly conduct toward/harassment of election workers an offense with possible fines of $300-$1,000. The Finance &amp; Personnel Committee voted on Monday to recommend the City Council adopt the ordinance at the next meeting of the council on August 16. City Clerk Tara McMenamin (formerly Coolidge) said the ordinance would protect everyone working during an election, which includes those working on mobile election units. McMenamin said there has been an increase in disorderly conduct during elections. “There is a lot of misinformation out there, so tensions are high on both sides,” she said and added that election officials and workers are worried. McMenamin said she did not want those working during an election to think they had to subject themselves to yelling or other misconduct. The new ordinance reads in part: “Conduct toward election official. (a) No person shall, in a public or private place, engage in violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous, unreasonably loud, or otherwise disorderly conduct directed at or toward an individual working in their capacity as an election official or based on their position as an election official, under circumstances in which such conduct tends to cause or provoke a disturbance. (b) No person shall knowingly interfere with or obstruct any individual working in their capacity as an election official in the performance of such individual’s duties related to the conduct of an election. (c) No person shall send an individual working in their capacity as an election official or based on their position as an election official a telecommunication message, with the reasonable expectation that such individual will receive the message, using any harassing, violent, abusive, threatening, indecent, or profane language or image, or any other message in which such telecommunication message tends to cause or provoke a disturbance.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3346" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FloridaFlag-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FloridaFlag-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FloridaFlag.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Florida</strong>: Voting-rights organizations urged a federal appeals court<a href="https://www.wcjb.com/2022/08/10/sides-battle-over-election-law-solicitation-restrictions/"> to reject part of a controversial Florida elections law</a> that prevents groups from providing food and water to people waiting in line at polling places. Attorneys for the League of Women Voters of Florida, the Black Voters Matter Fund, the Florida Alliance for Retired Americans and other plaintiffs filed a 67-page brief asking the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold a district judge’s ruling that said increased “solicitation” restrictions near polling places violate speech rights. Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in March found parts of the 2021 elections law (SB 90) unconstitutional after voting-rights groups and other plaintiffs filed a series of legal challenges. Walker concluded that the law passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature was intended to discriminate against Black Floridians. The state, the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee appealed Walker’s ruling to the Atlanta-based appeals court, which in May issued a stay that will allow the law to be in effect during this year’s elections. But the underlying legal battle continued, with the appeals court scheduled to hear arguments Sept. 15 in Miami. The series of challenges have been consolidated, with the brief filed Wednesday by the League of Women Voters and other plaintiffs in its portion of the case dealing with only two issues. That included arguments by the groups that the additional solicitation restrictions violated the First Amendment because they are overbroad and vague. Florida has long had a law aimed at curbing solicitation, such as seeking votes and distributing campaign literature, near polling places. But the brief Wednesday pointed to an additional phrase added in the 2021 law that would prohibit “engaging in any activity with the intent to influence or effect of influencing a voter.” It contended that the wording is “astonishingly broad” and unconstitutional.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5403" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NV-Flag-300x222.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="222" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NV-Flag-300x222.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NV-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Nevada</strong>: District Court Judge James Wilson has blocked Reno attorney and former Republican gubernatorial candidate Joey Gilbert’s<a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/judge-shoots-down-joey-gilbert-election-lawsuit-over-lack-of-competent-evidence"> effort to re-do the 2022 primary election</a>, finding that “no competent evidence” was presented that would warrant the extraordinary changes Gilbert sought. Wilson issued the ruling for summary judgment in favor of Clark County sheriff and Republican gubernatorial nominee Joe Lombardo from the bench on Wednesday, blocking the election contest from proceeding further.  Gilbert’s election contest, filed after a statewide recount on July 15, heavily relied on testimony from Edward Solomon, identified by the suit as an “expert mathematician,” who has alleged since the 2020 election that “algorithms” have been responsible for switching votes in multiple states. Wilson called the Solomon report “hearsay, first of all,” and said there was no showing that the information provided by “the admitted non-expert Mr. Solomon … is the product of a reliable methodology.” Wilson said the mathematical claims included in Gilbert’s suit had not met the standards laid out in state election law that would allow a judge to make a ruling reversing the results of an election or ordering a new one. He said the law specifically required the candidate making the election contest challenge to show that the alleged defects or number of challenged votes would be enough to make a difference in the final election results.</p>

A coalition of civil rights groups sued the Secretary of State’s Office in February for withholding the data concerning a voter purge program targeting immigrants that was mandated by a new Republican-backed election law. Yeakel agreed with the plaintiffs that the Secretary of State’s refusal to disclose the data violated the National Voter Registration Act, a 1993 law that requires public disclosure of records pertaining to the maintenance of voter rolls.</p>
<p>Five people sued Lubbock County Commissioners to<a href="https://www.everythinglubbock.com/news/local-news/lawsuit-demands-end-to-electronic-voting-machines-in-lubbock-county/"> stop the use of electronic voting systems</a>. They also demanded “proper investigations and reconciliation” of elections in the last two years. The lawsuit demands, among other things, that Lubbock County “implement a precinct level hand-marked paper ballot and hand counting system.”  The county already approved machines that keep a paper backup system in addition to the electronic records.  The preliminary statement in the lawsuit, filed by Ashley Johnson, Beverly D. Burnett, Royce C. Lewis, Laura Lynne Phillips and Sheryl Ann Sherman – all representing themselves to be Lubbock County registered voters – said, “This action is not an election contest case.” The basic claim was that Lubbock County uses Hart InterCivic voting machines. The lawsuit also claimed these voting machines do not meet state standards and they are vulnerable to so-called “black box” antics by nations such as China.</p>

Billings lost by 10 votes to Joseph Elison in the GOP primary. He sued the county clerk after a recount was canvassed demanding a hand recount of ballots. Court records show that on Wednesday, his attorneys filed to dismiss the lawsuit.  In a Facebook post, Billings said that cost of litigation was the factor for it. &#8220;&#8230;the cost of proving this in court is huge and the statute saying the Judge shall assign the county’s expenses beyond their legal fees to me, and that cannot be paid out of donations to my campaign means I would owe 10s of thousands of dollars over and above my own legal fees if I were to lose. This is also beyond the risk that I, or most any citizen can afford to take. I have great moral support but very little in the way of donations to fight this battle. The government has a bottomless pit of taxpayer dollars to use against me &#8211; and anyone else who is willing to stand up and ask obvious questions,&#8221; Billings wrote in a public post. Billings had questioned a statistical sample in an audit performed in the recount.</p>

Despite the extraordinary efforts of many educators, civic education too often is insufficient and inequitable. We can change that. Join us for a research presentation and panel, co-hosted by CIRCLE and iCivics, on how K-12 schools can play a role in preparing young people for participation in our nation&#8217;s constitutional democracy. The civic education experts at CIRCLE will share major findings and recommendations from the CIRCLE Growing Voters report about teens’ civic learning experiences — or lack thereof — and the role of schools in a paradigm-shifting framework for supporting young people’s civic development. In conversation with educators, students, teacher trainers, and other education leaders, we’ll discuss what these findings mean for multiple stakeholders in the K-12 schools ecosystem and the practical steps they can take to ensure each and every student, especially those from disadvantaged or marginalized communities, receives a high-quality civic education during this school year and into the future. <strong>When:</strong> August 31, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
