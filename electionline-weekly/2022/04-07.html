														<p><strong>Building Relationships </strong><br />
<em>How researchers and LEOs work together to advance election administration</em></p>
<p>By<a href="https://blogs.reed.edu/paul-gronke/"> Paul Gronke</a><br />
Professor of Political Science, Reed College<br />
Director, Elections &amp; Voting Information Center</p>
<p>This is the third in a series of three articles from the <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/">Elections &amp; Voting Information Center (EVIC) at Reed College</a> highlighting developments in election science and election administration research and the researchers conducting this important work.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7443" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />For this article, <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/about-evic/#program-consultant-jacob-bendicksen">EVIC team member Jacob Bendicksen</a> and I spoke to three early career election scholars: <a href="https://www.josephanthonyphd.com/">Joseph Anthony</a>, teaching assistant professor of American politics at Oklahoma State University (who <a href="https://twitter.com/josephkanthony/status/1511400143282704385?s=20&amp;t=YxMvVq-n7ET0YL2oXyihTQ">announced this week</a> he will be joining SUNY-Cortland in the fall as an assistant professor of political science); <a href="https://www.merivaki.com/">Lia Merivaki</a>, assistant professor of American politics at Mississippi State University and a member of the <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/peace/democracy/us-elections.html">Carter Center&#8217;s U.S. Elections Expert Study Team</a>; and <a href="https://www.marasuttmannlea.com/">Mara Suttmann-Lea</a>, assistant professor of American politics at Connecticut College and host of <a href="https://www.whatvotingmeanspod.com/">What Voting Means to Me</a>, a podcast about democracy &#8211; <a href="https://www.whatvotingmeanspod.com/episodes/episode-13-dustin-czarny">the latest episode</a> of which dropped yesterday and features <a href="https://dustinczarny.com/about/">New York’s Dustin Czarny</a>.</p>
<p>All three researchers have been publishing innovative and timely research about local election officials (LEOs) and the 2020 election. We had an informative and fun conversation with them about how they ended up in election research, their work, and their experiences on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>EVIC:</strong> As early-career scholars, what’s been most interesting to you about researching and understanding local election administration?</p>
<p><strong>Lia Merivaki:</strong> I was fortunate to be trained by <a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/dasmith/">Dan Smith</a> at the University of Florida, who constantly encouraged me to meet LEOs so I could understand them and their processes first-hand. As a non-citizen living in the United States, I had zero point of reference about the American voter experience, so I had a lot of catching up to do! It was so helpful for me to go to election officials’ offices and to ask them a lot of questions about their work. I realized how important it was to build a rapport and get to know the people who do this critical work. As researchers, we really have an incomplete picture if we just write about what we think is happening without talking to the people who do the work.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Anthony:</strong> I was lucky to have an ‘in’ to the election administration world thanks to my work with <a href="https://umsl.edu/~kimballd/">David Kimball</a> at the University of Missouri, St. Louis. I’ve found scholars in this world to be kind and generous, so from my perspective there aren’t barriers to entry. It’s more knowing that this world exists that is the challenge. For example, I had a conversation after the <a href="https://spsa.net/">Southern Political Science Association</a> (SPSA) meeting in San Antonio this past January with a scholar who has written about female LEOs and she didn’t know about our SPSA ‘conference within a conference’ focusing on election science research. We need to work harder to let other scholars &#8211; especially those early career scholars &#8211; know that we’re here. Conversations like this one are very important in helping to get the word out about the election science research community and enabling us to further collaborate.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7615" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Mara Suttmann-Lea:</strong> My entry into the field was unique. I was at a presentation that was looking at how pharmacists use discretion when deciding who is deserving of certain medications. It made me wonder about poll worker discretion and their decision-making process in accordance with the election laws of their state, and the processes and procedures prescribed by their local election office. My advisors encouraged me to pursue this question. Then I was fortunate to get to work with <a href="https://www.skidmore.edu/political_science/faculty/mann.php">Chris Mann</a> as my colleague at Skidmore for my first job. Next I met Lia and we hit the ground running <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2021-07/suttmannlea-merivaki_esra2021-florida_voter_registration_outreach.pdf">working together on research</a> in <a href="https://medium.com/mit-election-lab/how-do-local-election-officials-reach-new-voters-f788d97aac29">this exciting field</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EVIC:</strong> Joseph, you referenced the ‘conference within a conference’ that you organized at the 2022 SPSA meeting. Can you tell us a little bit about what is going on in the election science world from your perspective?</p>
<p><strong>JA:</strong> There is a lot of fresh and emergent work! Many researchers are really interested in the most relevant issues facing election administration and election administrators. I was excited to see so much collaboration with election officials. Every election science-related academic research conference in the last two years has included election officials as discussants and presenters which is very important in my opinion and experience. I’m an editor of the brand new <a href="https://twitter.com/JEARPjournal">Journal of Election Administration Research and Practice (JEARP)</a>, a collaboration between Auburn University and the <a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/">Election Center</a> (who also collaborate on the <a href="https://bulletin.auburn.edu/thegraduateschool/graduatedegreesoffered/publicadministrationandpublicpolicympaphd_major/electionadmin_cert/">Certified Election and Registration Administrators (CERA) program</a>) that bridges the gap between theory and practice. Half of our editorial board members at JEARP are election officials! Keep an eye out for an official announcement and more about our work coming soon. In the interim, please follow <a href="https://twitter.com/JEARPjournal">JEARP on Twitter</a>. Researchers want their research to be useful to election officials. Election officials are doing the hard work of conducting elections, and we have tools that allow us to systematically investigate challenges that election officials face and the outcomes of policies that are implemented. We want this engagement to be really useful and relevant, and we care deeply about our professional relationships and our interpersonal relationships within election administration.</p>
<p><strong>EVIC:</strong> Joseph, you have a paper that has many of those features and characteristics. Could you tell us about your paper at the SPSA meeting?</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7616" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/StanleyFerry.IL_-231x300.png" alt="" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/StanleyFerry.IL_-231x300.png 231w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/StanleyFerry.IL_.png 570w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" />JA:</strong> The Election Administration Professionalization Index (EAPI) is a project with <a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/polisci/directory/professorial-faculty/mitchell-brown/">Mitchell Brown</a> and <a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/polisci/directory/professorial-faculty/kathleen-hale/">Kathleen Hale</a> at Auburn. We are trying to assemble metrics to track professionalization in election administration. Professionalization is a term that&#8217;s applied in many bureaucratic settings, but is hard to track in our decentralized election system. Additionally, because some election officials are elected, specialization and professionalization develop differently than in areas where hiring requires a specific skill set. As a result, many election officials learn on the job, but that learning is regular and important. The EAPI is an attempt to pull all this together in one place.</p>
<p><strong>JB:</strong> Mara, we want to ask about your work with Lia on social media use among LEOs. Why is it important to study social media usage?</p>
<p><strong>MSL:</strong> This work grew out of conversations that Lia and I had in early 2020, in the midst of rapid shifts to mail voting across the country and an election where in-person contact would be constrained due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We had a hunch that <a href="https://medium.com/mit-election-lab/local-election-official-use-of-websites-and-social-media-during-the-2020-u-s-presidential-election-2cd57d4dae24">LEOs would use social media</a> to reach out to voters. We eventually realized that social media is an important way that we can compare voter education and outreach across jurisdictions. One of the more interesting challenges we face is how to identify social media accounts for LEOs. We’ve partnered with <a href="https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/r-michael-alvarez">Michael Alvarez</a> and his team at Caltech and are trying to figure out how to make this a public resource.</p>
<p><strong>EVIC:</strong> Lia, could you describe some of what you have found so far about the impact of social media and voter education in your work with Mara?</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6312" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />LM:</strong> Our most recent paper that we presented at SPSA in January (coming soon!) studies Facebook messages from LEOs in North Carolina about voting by mail (VBM). Our findings are very clear – specificity and clarity matter. The biggest challenge we found was some LEOs “drowning the message” by posting Facebook communications that talked in the same message about all the different ways that people can participate in the voting process. We found that focused and specific messages about the vote by mail process in North Carolina resulted in higher usage rates and lower error rates on VBM ballots in the local jurisdiction where this communication method was used. Our conclusion is that LEOs being active on social media isn’t enough, and there can be diminishing returns. Our recommendation is that LEOs streamline their messaging to provide clear and focused information about specific aspects of the voting process rather than lengthy, all-encompassing posts which can be confusing to some voters. Targeted and concise communication – at least on Facebook and at least about VBM in North Carolina in 2020 – showed clear and measurable results.</p>
<p><strong>EVIC:</strong> We want to turn now to some of your “on the ground” experiences working at the local level with LEOs or with others in the elections space. Lia, you’ve done work with LEOs in Mississippi – can you tell us about that?</p>
<p><strong>LM:</strong> Early in my time at Mississippi State, I was fortunate to receive a grant from the <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/">MIT Election &amp; Data Science Lab (MEDSL)</a> that helped me travel around the state to visit election administration offices, build relationships with LEOs and other election community stakeholders, and learn about how election officials do their work. At that time, no one was studying election administration in Mississippi, so I felt like a bit of a pioneer. I <a href="https://medium.com/mit-election-lab/managing-voter-registration-lists-the-hybrid-way-the-case-of-mississippi-ba0e8af7ff41">wrote</a> about differences in voter registration in the state and <a href="https://urbanaffairsreview.com/2018/10/24/mississippi-state-is-all-in-a-community-engaged-learning-approach-to-student-civic-engagement/">developed a civics education class</a> that got students excited about working in local elections, which has been so rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>EVIC:</strong> Mara, what about you and your work with LEOs?</p>
<p><strong>MSL:</strong> I’ve interviewed LEOs for various research projects, and the biggest takeaway for me has been the importance of qualitative research. There’s so much to learn that can’t be captured in a statute, on the internet, or in survey responses. Qualitative research is tough from a ‘getting stuff out there quickly’ perspective as an early-career scholar, but it’s so rewarding and offers such a rich, in-depth look at what’s happening in the minds of folks who conduct elections.</p>

<p><strong>EVIC:</strong> Joseph, we know you were once a community organizer. To wrap things up, tell us a bit about what that experience taught you.</p>
<p><strong>JA:</strong> Right out of college, I worked as the director of the Missouri Disability Vote Project, which aimed to implement the Help America Vote Act in Missouri with an eye towards access for people with disabilities. We built a coalition, and I understood that side, but had no experience with local election administration. Working with so many LEOs who did things in different ways was a formative experience for me. I was and remain so amazed that, for all their differences, the administrators I met all want the election system to deliver the promise of American democracy. LEOs really do understand their job as the gatekeepers of democracy and they take it very seriously.</p>
<p>Thanks to Joseph, Lia, and Mara for their insights and time spent sharing with us, and to Mindy and electionline for the opportunity to publish these important conversations over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Many thanks also to all of the state and local election officials who take the time to work with academic researchers and teach us about what you do. I know I speak for all of us in saying how much we value you and the critical role you play in our democracy. We appreciate you reading this series and we encourage you to reach out to any of us if we can be of assistance. To further learn about you and your work and insights as LEOs, please be on the lookout for the <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/leo-survey-summary/">2022 Democracy Fund/EVIC at Reed College LEO Survey</a> over the coming weeks and respond.</p>

In the past two years, conspiracists have targeted Colorado clerks, citing fraud and security issues within Colorado’s election systems. Some of these false claims have ranged from accusations that China hacked Colorado’s voter registration database to reports claiming that Colorado’s voting systems are not properly certified. “Unfortunately, over the last several months, there have been claims from election deniers that purport to prove fraudulent elections in Colorado,” Boulder County Clerk Molly Fitzpatrick said. “These claims are often lengthy, and they’re often full of jargon, and they do not provide proof or data. They consistently demonstrate a lack of understanding of our process.” The officials are challenging deniers and conspiracy theorists to basically put up or shut up. “We have taken the unprecedented step to gather today as each of our county’s chief election officials because we can no longer stand by while a small group of well-funded conspiracy theorists prepare to gather on our Capitol steps to further share their half-truths and lies,” La Plata County Clerk and Recorder Tiffany Lee said. The Colorado County Clerk’s Association is hoping to employ a four-point list that aims to prevent future accusations of election fraud. These measures, according to Weld County Clerk Carly Koppes, will include providing ballot images online for free so the public can look at the cast vote record, increasing signature verification audit processes to make them more consistent across the state, and making sure that elections stay properly funded.</p>

The policy creates a transparent and predictable path for future updates to the VVSG and brings a new maturity to the process. This is a significant step in the implementation of the VVSG 2.0 and will let the standards evolve with the needs of election officials and future voting system technologies. The four EAC Commissioners unanimously approved the VVSG Lifecycle Policy. The intent of the VVSG Lifecycle Policy is to facilitate a regular review of the VVSG standards, and provide guidance on when and how new versions will be adopted, and older versions will be discontinued and maintained. The policy defines changes that may be made to systems certified to older standards and describes the process for updating the standards as defined in the Help America Vote Act (HAVA).</p>

While, in the past, the individuals administering the elections process operated with relative obscurity, party leaders have targeted them and their offices in the hopes of controlling the voting process. This amplified attention may incentivize extreme partisans to attempt to subvert, undermine, or overturn an election. Acting with political self-interest, partisan officials could use their power to undermine legitimate and fair elections and overturn the will of the people. The threat is no longer theoretical. If Americans intend to maintain a democratic system of government, we must reimagine election administration to reduce or remove partisan incentives and strengthen the firewall between politics and the administration of the voting process.”</p>

The Postal Service Reform Act lifts budget requirements that have contributed to the agency&#8217;s red ink, and spells out that mail must be delivered six days a week, except for federal holidays, natural disasters and some other situations. The legislation cleared Congress last month after fully a dozen years of discussion. The new law ends a requirement that the Postal Service finance workers’ health care benefits ahead of time for the next 75 years — an obligation that private companies and federal agencies do not face. Biden said that rule had “stretched the Postal Service&#8217;s finances almost to the breaking point.&#8221; Dropped from the package as it neared actual legislation were efforts to cut back mail delivery. Also set aside — for now — were other proposals that have been floated over the years to change operations, including to privatize some services. Biden said Wednesday that more needs to be done to reform the Postal Service, including investing in an electrified vehicle fleet that could save money while helping combat climate change.  “Today we enshrine into law our recognition that the Postal Service is fundamental to our economy, to our democracy, to our health and the very sense of who we are as a nation,” Biden said.</p>

Critics of the bill say it could also have a chilling effect on grassroots organizations who work alongside elected officials to host voter registration and education events. Members of multiple grassroots organizations and the Secretary of State’s office spoke against the bill during the public hearing before the vote, while a couple of election officials and the Eagle Forum lent support.  Kathy Jones, president of the League of Women Voters Alabama, said language in the bill prohibiting the acceptance of personal services is the problem, saying it creates confusion. Hugh Evans, general counsel of the Secretary of State’s office, also spoke out against the bill. Secretary of State John Merrill had drafted a very similar bill to Allen’s that failed to gain the momentum of HB194.   Evans said the office agrees with stopping the privatization of elections, but shared similar concerns that the language could affect voter registration programs.</p>
<p>The Senate Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Development Committee advanced two House bills on<a href="https://www.wsfa.com/2022/04/07/alabama-senate-committee-passes-bills-change-state-voter-registration-rules/"> voter registration</a>. The first bill would prevent poll watchers from helping someone submit their ballot. Supporters say that’s because watchers represent parties or candidates, and poll workers are impartial. The other legislation will help stop confusion around voter registration. The legislation could come up for a floor vote in the final passage before the week is over.</p>

The legislation is the latest Republican-led change to election rules in Georgia after the close 2020 presidential election. The bill passed along party lines in both the state House and state Senate. The legislation would authorize the GBI to investigate any potential infractions that could have put the results of an election in doubt. The GBI’s law enforcement authority would overlap with election investigators in the secretary of state’s office, which would also continue to look into election infractions. Election officials have repeatedly recounted, investigated and upheld the results of the 2020 election. Under the legislation, Senate Bill 441, the GBI would be empowered to start election fraud inquiries and subpoena records, supplementing the authority of the secretary of state’s office. The GBI previously found no fraud after it assisted in investigations of absentee ballot signatures, counterfeit ballots and ballot collection. Lawmakers backed off other election proposals, including efforts to unseal paper ballots for public inspection, impose strict ballot handling rules and restrict nonprofit election funding.</p>

The GOP is still pursuing efforts to restrict the use of ballot drop boxes. Republican lawmakers&#8217; latest plans emerged Friday from negotiations between the House and Senate over proposals to tighten state election laws. While the Senate approved the proposal on ballot drop boxes late Friday, the House did not take it up before lawmakers adjourned early Saturday for their annual, three-week spring break. The GOP-controlled Senate also approved a proposal that would cut the number of drop boxes across the state by more than 40% — with some significant decreases in rural, heavily Republican counties. The GOP-controlled House considered neither measure, and a proposal to end the three-day grace period died in a House committee. The proposal on ballot drop boxes was part of a broader agenda for conservatives that also included passing a proposal to make it easier for parents to challenge classroom and library materials in public schools. Lawmakers are scheduled to reconvene April 25 to wrap up their business for the year. The vote in the Senate on the ballot drop box measure was 21-17, with some Republicans who represent rural areas joining Democrats in voting against it. Under the measure, 48 of the state&#8217;s 105 counties would lose at least one drop box, and statewide, the number would drop by 80, to 111 from the 191 used in the 2020 elections, according to the Kansas secretary of state&#8217;s office.</p>

Andy Beshear. One measure adds six days of in-person absentee voting in county clerks&#8217; offices before early voting begins, the secretary of state&#8217;s office said. It clarifies that early voting locations must be open for eight hours, including the Saturday before the election. It puts into state law an existing policy of not connecting voting machines to the internet, making such violations a felony. And the measure expands the definition of “election worker” for purposes of protection from intimidation. The other measure moves up the full statewide transition to paper ballots to the start of 2024, in time for the next presidential election. Last year&#8217;s election law required counties to move to paper ballots the next time their election machines needed upgrading. The new bill sets a definite time to make the transition, the secretary of state&#8217;s office said. The two-year budget passed by lawmakers provides $12.5 million each year to help counties offset the costs of purchasing the new machines. The bill also calls for voting machines to be put under video surveillance when not in operation and it doubles the number of counties subjected to post-election audits. A minimum of 12 counties will be audited if the measure becomes law, compared to six in prior election years. The counties are randomly drawn by the attorney general&#8217;s office, which conducts the audit.</p>

Janet Mills has<a href="https://fox23maine.com/news/local/election-integrity-law-signed-by-mills-to-protect-elections"> signed legislation</a> into law that will clarify the chain of custody of ballots and voting machines in Maine, while also preventing any unauthorized people from gaining access.</p>
<p>The Legislature has approved a bill that will<a href="https://mainebeacon.com/lawmakers-pass-bill-to-protect-election-workers-amid-increase-in-threats/"> strengthen protections</a> in the law for election workers and volunteers. State Rep. Bruce White, D-Waterville, who introduced the bill, said in addition to making interfering with an election worker a Class D misdemeanor, the bill would add a reporting procedure to document threats. White added that the bill is aimed at not only protecting workers, but protecting democracy and free and fair elections. He noted that if there aren’t enough workers and volunteers, polling places become disorganized and lines can get long. “We really want to provide adequate protections, so that all of us have that right to cast our ballot on Election Day,” he said. “We want the process to go smooth, and are thankful for all the workers out there, too.”</p>

The Secretary of State&#8217;s Office initially worked with lawmakers to develop the bills following a 2019 report from the state&#8217;s auditor that recommended improvements to Michigan&#8217;s voter list maintenance. But Republican lawmakers made changes to the legislation the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office said would add unnecessary costs and open the door to errors.  The GOP bills passed on a party-line vote in the state Senate while only a handful of Democrats supported the legislation in the state House.  The elections bills aimed at cleaning up Michigan&#8217;s voter rolls targeted voters with unknown birth dates and those who haven&#8217;t cast a ballot  in decades. The bills would have required those voters to complete a form mailed out by election officials, undergo signature verification and provide identifying information to ensure they could vote in future elections. Whitmer wrote in her veto letter that the bills &#8220;do not advance the goal of improving Michigan elections&#8221; and said &#8220;they would burden clerks and voters while increasing costs to Michigan residents.&#8221;</p>

Tate Reeves signed House Bill 1365  and it will become law July 1. It says state or local officials who conduct elections<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/mississippi-joins-states-limiting-election-funding-83873494"> cannot solicit or accept donations</a> from any private group for “voter education, voter outreach or voter registration programs.&#8221; Reeves said in a video posted to Facebook on Monday that he was “deeply disturbed by big tech&#8217;s attempt to influence the 2020 elections.” “Whether it was their attempt to silence conservative voices or suppress information they don&#8217;t agree with, California&#8217;s technology elites will stop at nothing to push their woke ideology on the American people,&#8221; Reeves said. &#8220;Our elections cannot be left up to billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, especially when groups like Facebook systematically silence conservative voices on their platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Legislature has passed a bill that<a href="https://www.djournal.com/news/state-news/legislature-reforms-voter-registration-laws-to-settle-federal-lawsuit/article_380dcc59-f8cb-5ab1-b9cc-c77311a5dec1.html"> changes how naturalized citizens can register to vote</a> in Mississippi.

According to the legislation, if a person is flagged by the state system as potentially being a non-U.S. citizen, that person’s name will be checked with the federal immigration database. If both the federal and state database flag the person who registered to vote as a noncitizen, county clerks will notify that person that have 30 days to submit proof of U.S. citizenship. If a person fails to submit proof by that deadline, their voter registration status will be marked as “pending” for the next federal election. If a pending voter does not submit citizenship proof within the 30-day time frame and still attempts to vote, they will be forced to cast an affidavit ballot during the election. The flagged voter then has a five days to present citizenship information to their county clerk’s office for the affidavit vote to count.</p>

Lawmakers gave their ballot measure initial approval in a voice vote. Another vote is needed to send the proposal to the GOP-led Senate, which is moving at a glacial pace this year amid Republican infighting. If passed by both chambers, the measure would go before voters for final consideration. The legislative proposal is in direct opposition to another group’s effort to radically change how Missouri handles elections for statewide candidates, lawmakers and U.S. Congress. The bipartisan Better Elections campaign has proposed a constitutional amendment that would give voters the option to pick from both Republicans and Democrats during primaries. Currently, voters can either choose to nominate one candidate from a pool of either all Republicans or all Democrats. In the general election, voters then could vote for either their No. 1 choice or rank their picks from a pool of the four highest-vote-getting candidates from the primary.</p>

The bill would void ballots of voters who don’t<a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/briefs/new-hampshire-senate-passes-bill-that-would-void-ballots-if-domicile-isnt-proven/"> prove domicile</a>. If it becomes law,<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=2108&amp;inflect=2"> Senate Bill 418</a> would create a new kind of ballot called an “affidavit ballot,” requiring voters to mail in a copy of the missing documentation within 10 days of an election in order for their vote to count in the final tally. Right now, to vote without an ID you must sign a legally binding document to verify your identity, a provision used by around 6,000 people in the 2016 election that this bill would eliminate. The<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/pdf.aspx?id=32940&amp;q=amendment"> version of the bill</a> the Senate passed is pared back from the original, which would have impacted same-day voter registration. The version that passed the Senate would affect only people who come to vote without an ID.</p>
<p>Last week, the Senate approved Senate Bill 418. Under Senate Bill 418, the ballots would be held aside after the election and<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/gov-sununu-expresses-concern-bill-create-provisional-ballots/39655040"> affidavit voters</a> would have to provide proof of their domicile in New Hampshire for their vote to count.  If proof is not provided within 10 days, the ballot gets tossed and the vote subtracted from the totals in the election. Senate Bill 418 is now in the House, but Gov. Chris Sununu, R-NH, indicated that he&#8217;s skeptical of the changes the legislation would make. “The problem I have, generally, with provisional ballots is that you may not get a result for days after the election, and that&#8217;s a problem,” Sununu said. &#8220;New Hampshire has always had a great system where you get the results that night, our system works, it has integrity.&#8221;</p>

The bill would require schools to let their students know they are eligible to vote when they turn 18 years old. Additionally, Senate Bill 2064 will require schools to provide information about how to register to vote, including the date and time of the supplemental voter registration conducted at the student&#8217;s high school. If passed, the bill will allow students to use their school ID to verify their identity at the polls. Also, it gets rid of the requirement of a person casting their ballot in person when they vote for the first time.</p>

In a brief order the justices rejected a bid by the Arizona Republican Party to get the justices to declare that early voting is unconstitutional. They rejected arguments by attorneys for the party that the issue is strictly legal and ripe for them to decide. But the order, signed by Chief Justice Robert Brutinel, does not end the matter. He said the challengers are free to refile the case in Maricopa County Superior Court where they can provide some factual basis for their allegations. Only after there is a decision at the trial court — and the judge there makes some findings — would it be appropriate for the high court to review the issue. Central to the fight is the contention by attorney Alexander Kolodin that the only form of voting specifically authorized by the framers of the state constitution is in person, and on Election Day. What that means, he said, is anything else — including the current system of no-excuse early ballots created by the legislature in 1991 — is illegal.</p>
<p>At least<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1768597/2-lawsuits-filed-against-new-gop-backed-voter-registration-rules"> two federal lawsuits</a> have already been filed challenging voter registration requirements signed into law Wednesday by Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The Republican-backed legislation seeks to expand U.S. citizenship voting requirements in the state, but critics warn it violates federal law and will jeopardize the voter registrations of thousands of Arizona residents. The first lawsuit from Mi Familia Vota, a local voter outreach organization, was filed less than 24 hours after the governor signed House Bill 2492. The bill “severely burdens the right to vote and, in many cases, will deny that right entirely, disenfranchising eligible, lawful voters in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments,” attorney Roy Herrera wrote. A separate lawsuit filed by Campaign Legal Center on behalf of several Arizona advocacy groups, including Living United for Change in Arizona and the Arizona Students&#8217; Association, makes similar claims that the bill targets Arizonans based on which type of registration form they used to register to vote. “The anti-voter policies in HB 2492, signed into law by Governor Doug Ducey, create new barriers to Arizonans’ freedom to vote and violate long-standing federal law,” said Trevor Potter, founder and president of Campaign Legal Center.</p>

Justices granted the emergency stay Friday requested by Republican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge.  It puts on hold a Pulaski County judge’s injunction against the restrictions the GOP-led Legislature passed last year.  The new measures include changing the state’s voter ID law to allow those without photo identification to vote if they sign an affidavit. The high court’s one-page order didn’t elaborate on the reason for staying the lower court judge’s decision.</p>

Given that history, he said, some future election law changes should be subject to court approval. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who made the election bill a priority, said the state will appeal Walker&#8217;s decision and win. &#8220;In front of certain district judges, we know we will lose no matter what because they are not going to follow the law,&#8221; DeSantis said at a news conference in West Palm Beach. He did not say specifically why he believes the ruling is incorrect.  Upon appeal, the case would go to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, Georgia, which is seen as being more conservative.</p>

The appeals court reversed and remanded the St. Martin Parish 16th Judicial District Court’s ruling in the case Louisiana v. Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL). The lower court, which dismissed Landry’s claim that state law prohibits parish registrars and clerks of court from accepting donations from private organizations to pay for election-related expenses, will have to rehear the case. The appeals panel found that the lower court erred when it defined parish registrars of voters and clerks of court as parish officials with the constitutional authority of political subdivisions to “acquire property for any public purpose by purchase, donation, expropriation, exchange, or otherwise” as detailed in the Louisiana Constitution.  Rather, the appeals panel stated, clerks of court and parish registrars are state officials who operate within a limited geographical jurisdiction. Thus, as state officials, they may not acquire property or funding in the same manner as would a local or parish government. The appeals court noted that seven similar federal lawsuits against CTCL filed in other states have all been dismissed, but the donations at issue in those cases “were offered to and accepted by the counties or cities holding the elections rather than by election officials such as registrars of voters and clerks of court.”</p>

A Superior Court trial that concluded in January 2020 upheld the election results and subsequent recount, and focused on a series of individual challenges that each had the potential to tip the race’s outcome by a single vote, either doubling the margin of victory or eliminating it. That included three absentee ballots the city accepted that Manning argues it shouldn’t have, ballots that were rejected but Manning argues should’ve been reviewed by the court, and a single last-minute voter who lacked proof of residency and was therefore denied access to a ballot. Ultimately, the trial ended in the city’s favor and Riccardi was sworn in days later. Ryan appealed the case to the Appeals Court, however, and the process slowly played out as Riccardi finished the term and won a new term last November to continue serving Ward 6. “Does that mean the challenges to the individual voters are moot?” asked Associate Judge Gabrielle Wolohojian. “If the contest itself is moot&#8230; which I think it has to be because the term is over, then whether the three people should’ve been counted, couldn’t have&#8230; that seems to me to all be moot.” The issues remain alive, Manning argued, because the city’s elections office made errors in 2019 that could be repeated going forward.</p>

In his 58-page<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pi_order_-_western_native_voice_v._jacobsen.pdf"> ruling</a>, Moses wrote that the plaintiffs had effectively made the case that the four laws may be unconstitutional. The ruling comes from a consolidation of different cases in which a number of groups, including the Montana Democratic Party, Western Native Voice, a few Native American tribes and Montana Youth Action filed lawsuits to overturn four recently passed state laws: HB 506, SB 169, HB 176, and HB 530. Lawmakers said the four laws were intended to combat voter fraud and “ensure voter integrity.” Perhaps the most impactful law, HB 176, would have ended same-day voter registration in the state, which has been in place since 2005, and has been used by thousands of voters in each election since. The new law would have pushed the deadline to register to vote back to noon on the day before Election Day. In his ruling, Moses said the plaintiffs had made a reasonably strong case that “HB 176 unconstitutionally burdens the right to vote because HB 176 eliminates an important voting option for Native Americans and will make it harder, if not impossible, for some Montanans to vote.”</p>

Clune, executive director of Disability Rights New York, in a statement. The<a href="https://dralegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_Complaint.pdf"> original complaint</a>, filed in May 2020, said voters with disabilities who did not want to vote in person out of fear of contracting Covid-19 were being excluded from absentee voting because they were unable to independently fill out paper ballots. Once the new system is in place, voters with disabilities will be able to request ballots from their local election boards up to 15 days before any election. These ballots will come with postage-paid return envelopes and “oath envelopes” that will feature raised markers indicating where voters with visual impairments can sign their names, though the board will accept signatures written anywhere on the envelopes. The new system will also allow voters with disabilities to mark their ballots electronically with the help of computer software that describes text and images in sound. Marked ballots can then be printed and mailed. The settlement requires the board to pay $400,000 in lawyer fees to those who sued.</p>

The stay blocks any felons from registering to vote until appeals in the case are resolved. “The motion [for a] temporary stay is allowed,” according to an Appeals Court order. “The ‘Final Judgment and Order’ entered by a divided three-judge panel of Wake County Superior Court on 28 March 2022 is hereby stayed pending this Court’s ruling on the petition for writ of supersedeas.” A writ of superseadas blocks a lower court order from taking effect until appeals are resolved. “The North Carolina State Board of Elections shall not order the denial of felon voter registration applications received pursuant to the ‘Final Judgment and Order’ but shall order such applications to be held and not acted on until further order of this Court,” the Appeals Court order continued. Action from the Appeals Court might not represent the final word in the dispute. On Monday plaintiffs in the case titled Community Success Initiative v. Moore asked the state Supreme Court to take the case. If the state’s highest court steps in, it could overrule the Appeals Court’s action. The ruling could affect 56,000 felons who have completed active prison time. That includes felons on probation, parole, or post-release supervision.</p>

However, they needed to be postmarked on or before 4:00 p.m. Monday. Gelb described the latest mail ballot issue as a ‘glitch.’ Gelb ordered the Bureau of Elections to accept any of the affected ballots that are postmarked on or before Monday, April 4, and received by the bureau by 4:00 p.m. on April 11. Denise Williams, the Chair of the Luzerne County Board of Elections is satisfied with her decision. “Those voters were impacted and it would be important not to disenfranchise anything that’s not their fault at all,” said Denise Williams, Chair, Luzerne County Board of Elections &amp; Registration. It was just last Thursday that 305 voters were sent their mail-in or absentee ballot for Tuesday’s special elections for the 116th state house district.

The Shelby County primary is May 3. Early voting starts in less than two weeks on April 13. And on the first two days of early voting only one location will be open and the plaintiffs say that’s just wrong. “There’s really no logical reason all precincts can’t be open every day of early voting,” Memphis NAACP President Van Turner told Action News 5. Turner says his organization joined UpTheVote901 and the Black Clergy Collaborative in filing a lawsuit against the Shelby County Election Commission on Thursday, March 31, because only one early voting location will be open the first two days of early voting April 13 and 14. That location is the downtown Election Commission office at 157 Poplar. The suit also accuses the Election Commission of violating the state constitution, the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Tennessee Open Meetings Act for holding what the lawsuit calls “secret meetings.”</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/HA/HA08/20220411/114569/HHRG-117-HA08-20220411-SD001.pdf">Field Hearing: Voting in America: Access to the Ballot In New Mexico</a>: The Subcommittee on Elections of the Committee on House Administration will hold a hearing at the New Mexico State Capitol. The proceeding will be livestreamed. <strong>When:</strong> April 11, 10am Pacific. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/events/universal-voting">Universal Voting</a>: Twenty-six coun­tries require parti­cip­a­tion in their elec­tions. In 100% Demo­cracy: The Case for Univer­sal Voting, co-authors E.J. Dionne and Miles Rapo­port argue that the United States should follow in their foot­steps. After all, Amer­ic­ans are required to pay taxes and serve on juries. Join us for a conver­sa­tion with the authors and New York City Coun­cil member Alexa Avilés about univer­sal voting and how to imple­ment it. <strong>When:</strong> April 12 6pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/100-democracy-the-case-for-universal-voting/">100% Democracy: The Case for Universal Voting</a>:  It is time for voting rights and democracy advocates to move away from defense and blaze a path toward universal participation in our experiment in self-government. In “100% Democracy: The Case for Universal Voting,” Brookings Senior Fellow EJ Dionne, Jr. and former Connecticut Secretary of the State Miles Rapoport argue that requiring everyone to participate in our elections should be a cornerstone of our democratic system. It would be the surest way to protect against voter suppression and the active disenfranchisement of a large share of our citizens. It would also create a system true to the aspirations written in the Declaration of Independence, by calling for a government based on the consent of all the governed. On April 14, Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund will moderate a conversation with Dionne and Rapoport to discuss key takeaways from “100% Democracy,” universal voting, and the transformative steps lawmakers can take to increase turnout and make our elections truly representative. <strong>When:</strong> April 14, 10am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rstreet.org/event/best-practices-for-election-audits/">Best Practices for Election Audits</a>: Properly administered election audits are one of the most important tools states can use to improve voter confidence and election security. In 2020, however, state legislatures in multiple states used audits for the opposite goal of undermining the public’s faith in elections and the electoral results themselves. Join us on April 14, as representatives from the Brennan Center for Justice and the R Street Institute discuss the audits that followed the last election cycle and explore options to strengthen oversight of our elections going forward. This virtual panel discussion is hosted by Wayne Law’s Voting Rights and Election Law Society and the Levin Center at Wayne Law. <strong>When:</strong> April 14, 12:15pm <strong>Eastern.</strong> Where: Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eac.gov/events/2022/04/14/2022-eac-standards-board-annual-meeting">2022 EAC Standards Board Annual Meeting</a>: The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) Standards Board will hold their 2022 Annual Meeting primarily to discuss next steps regarding the VVSG 2.0 Requirements and implementation, the status of the EAC&#8217;s e-poll book pilot program, and supply chain issues affecting the 2022 midterm elections. This meeting will include a question-and-answer discussion between board members and EAC staff. Board members will also review FACA Board membership guidelines and policies with EAC Acting General Counsel and receive a general update about the EAC programming. The Board will also elect two new members to the Executive Board Committee. <strong>When:</strong> April 14, 1:30pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/event/beyond-winner-take-all-possibilities-proportional-voting-united-states">Beyond Winner-Take-All: Possibilities for Proportional Voting in the United States</a>: At a time when many are rightly concerned about the health of American democracy, scholars and reformers are evaluating proposals to make democracy more functional and representative. One such proposal is to move beyond the winner-take-all electoral system used at the federal and state levels in the United States to enable adoption of proportional voting systems. What would be the impact of proportional voting in the United States, and what will it take to enact it?  Join panelists Rob Richie, President and CEO of FairVote, Rebecca Chavez-Houck, Community Engagement Consultant and Former Utah State Legislator, and Danielle Allen, James Bryant Conant University Professor at Harvard University in discussion. Archon Fung, Winthrop Laflin McCormack Professor of Citizenship and Self-Government at Harvard Kennedy School, Director of the Ash Center&#8217;s Democratic Governance Programs, will moderate. <strong>When:</strong> April 19, 4pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hhh.umn.edu/election-administration/election-accuracy-going-offensive">Election Accuracy: Going on the Offensive</a>: Local and state election officials in the United States — who run the most accurate and secure voting process in the world — are finding that facts are not a sufficient defense of their election outcomes. Despite the rigorous steps that protect voter registration, ballot distribution, election systems and vote counting, conspiracy theories are undermining the public&#8217;s trust in this most basic act of a democracy. To combat this problem, experts from around the nation analyze the problem to provide actionable steps so election administrators can go on the offense to manage communications before, during and after an election. Hosted by the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. 9am to 12:30pm Central. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> April 22.</p>
