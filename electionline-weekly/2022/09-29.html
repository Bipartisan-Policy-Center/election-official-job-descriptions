							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Poll watchers and poll workers</strong><br />
<em>New threat faces election administration in 2022</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>For years, poll watchers have been a relatively benign part of the Election Day process. People enlisted by candidates or political parties to watch the process and make sure all was well. Sometimes their work even resulted in an<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/02-10/"> elections meet cute</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/poll-watcher-qualifications.aspx">Laws</a> governing poll watchers vary from state to state and recently,<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/31/1120385486/1a-remaking-america-the-poll-watchers-primed-with-disinformation"> concerns have been raised</a> — rightfully so — that poll <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7443" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />watchers emboldened by political parties and disinformation  could  create problems at the polls this November.</p>
<p><a href="https://bouldercounty.gov/departments/clerk-and-recorder/">Boulder County, Colorado</a> Clerk Molly Fitzpatrick said it’s something she’s been thinking about a lot.</p>
<p>“We are diligent about communicating expectations and guidelines for watchers to the political parties and to the watchers themselves when they arrive on site,” Fitzpatrick said. “Our goal is to help them be successful in complying with state law, rule, and county policy because we consider them an important part of the process and we want them to be successful with their watching duties.”</p>
<p>According to Fitzpatrick, Boulder is a county with a very active watcher effort and fortunately in the recent years have had minimal instances in which watchers weren’t complying with the expectations provided to them when arriving on site. Still, she and her colleagues are vigilant and prepared.  When watchers do not comply with expectations, the  process is to first provide feedback on how to comply with expectations and if that does not work the process is to revoke their watcher credentials.</p>
<p>“We are aware of the environment and the calls to actions from political leaders to disrupt the process. We will continue to ensure that our staff, judges, and workers are trained to identify and report potential disruptors as well as how de-escalate tense situations (<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/election-security-in-a-time-of-disturbance">leveraging resources provided by the Elections Group</a>),” Fitzpatrick said. “We will also continue to invest in proactive communication to political parties and watchers about the expectations as well as letting them know what they consequences are if the expectations are not followed. We will act swiftly to ensure that our environment is productive, compliant, and safe.”</p>
<p>In addition to<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/election-security-in-a-time-of-disturbance"> Election Security in a Time of Disturbance</a> from The Elections Group, the recently-formed Committee for Safe and Secure has<a href="https://safeelections.org/five-steps-to-safer-elections"> Five Steps to Safer Elections</a>. The Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University has provided<a href="https://bridgingdivides.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf246/files/documents/De-Escalation%20Guidance%20for%20Poll%20Workers.pdf"> De-Escalation Guidance for Poll Workers</a>.

All poll watchers in Texas must now obtain a Certificate of Completion from the secretary of state’s office through the program.</p>
<p>The new<a href="https://pollworkertraining.sos.texas.gov/"> poll watcher training program</a> enhances the previous program by including a quiz after each poll watcher lesson to ensure that each person completing the training fully understands the material and the relevant Texas Election Code provisions relating to the appointment, duties, and permissible conduct of poll watchers. The training program requires each prospective poll watcher to answer 100% of quiz questions correctly before moving on to the next lesson.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new [program] will ensure that every individual who wishes to observe and report on the voting process in their county understands Texas election law, knows how to spot violations of the Texas Election Code, and is properly trained on how to report any irregularities they may observe,” Secretary of State John Scott said in a press release. “Ensuring transparency is a key aspect of maintaining election integrity, and our office encourages all Texans who want to become poll watchers to study the training material thoroughly and treat all voters, poll workers and election officials with absolute respect while observing the voting process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Local Texas elections officials are hopeful that this new training program will help ease any confusion and tension that may arise on Election Day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3340" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting-300x193.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Paper-Voting.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“The training is actually a very good thing,” Smith County Elections Administrator Michelle Allcon<a href="https://tylerpaper.com/news/local/smith-county-elections-admin-new-training-will-better-equip-poll-watchers/article_53296d40-381d-11ed-887d-0f37c91c2170.html"> told</a> the Tyler Morning Telegraph. “(Poll watchers) have an idea of what they’re supposed to be doing, how they’re supposed to be behaving, what the poll workers are supposed to be doing, and how the watchers are supposed to approach any type of situation they encounter.”</p>
<p>In North Carolina, the State Board of Elections recently tried to<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-voting-presidential-north-carolina-election-2020-ab1c7c9e4d06f318322ed06b76a628c8"> enhance the rules</a> governing poll watchers, but those changes were<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-voting-presidential-election-2020-6ae93d1d7d3b4d503d02995bbb517200"> shot down</a> by the state’s Rules Review Commission.</p>
<p>Patrick Gannon, public information director with the NCSBOE said the Board’s decision to attempt to enhance the rules for poll watchers was a response to incidents in some counties during the May 2022 primary election, along with general concerns about today’s environment around elections.</p>
<p>“Many county directors want to ensure that there are clearly defined rules governing partisan election observers,” Gannon said citing a survey of local elections directors following the primary.</p>
<p>With the new proposed rules on hold, the NCSBOE is  working on detailed guidance for the 100 county boards of elections that will go out soon in addition to<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/sboe/numbermemo/2020/Numbered%20Memo%202020-30_Conduct%20at%20the%20Polls.pdf"> existing guidance</a> that was sent out prior to the 2020 election.</p>
<p>“At a recent statewide conference attended by county elections officials, the State Board offered detailed training on developing relationships with law enforcement to manage any disruptions at the polls, and it provided county officials further guidance on the tools at the disposal of poll workers to address disruptive behavior,” Gannon said. “The State Board also has procedures in place to gather information from polling sites during the conduct of voting and to respond, as necessary, if there are disruptive activities.”</p>
<p>Gannon said the State Board will be closely monitoring any incidents at the polls this fall and will then assess the most effective approach to ensuring order at voting sites going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Poll Workers</strong><br />
While poll workers are the backbone of any successful Election Day, lately there have been concerns that poll workers recruited by political parties could disrupt the process. Just this week, a poll worker in Kent County, Michigan during the August primary was<a href="https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/politics/elections/election-worker-charged-with-falsifying-records-in-kent-county/69-1d7cdf47-7a05-4b8b-8053-fc73dafac015"> charged with falsifying records</a>. According to local news reports, after the polls closed, a witness allegedly saw James Hokeboer put a personal USB in an e-poll book.</p>
<p>&#8220;This incident is extremely egregious and incredibly alarming. Not only is it a violation of Michigan law, but it is a violation of public trust and of the oath all election workers are required to take,&#8221; Kent County Clerk Lisa Posthumus Lyons told the media outlet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8863" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/allianceforsecuringdemocracy-300x156.png" alt="" width="300" height="156" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/allianceforsecuringdemocracy-300x156.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/allianceforsecuringdemocracy.png 464w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This week, the<a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/"> Alliance for Securing Democracy</a>, has published a new paper on a number of targeted measures that state and local election officials can take to prevent, detect, and/or recover from rogue poll workers.</p>
<p><a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/vetting-poll-workers/">How to Vet Poll Workers to Mitigate Future Election Subversion Efforts</a> looks at how to vet and train poll workers more thoroughly as well as what to do in the event that a poll worker(s) goes rogue.</p>

							<h2>Happy Anniversary Electionline!</h2>
														<p><strong>electionline.org is 21!</strong></p>
<p>By Doug Chapin, director emeritus<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>On September 28, 2001, a new site made its debut on what was still called the World Wide Web. Its name was electionline.org, and it was the first public product of the Election Reform Information Project, funded by a grant from The Pew Charitable Trusts to the University of Richmond.</p>
<div id="attachment_8884" style="width: 342px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8884" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-8884" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/electionline21-300x169.jpeg" alt="" width="332" height="187" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/electionline21-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/electionline21-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/electionline21-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/electionline21.jpeg 1437w" sizes="(max-width: 332px) 100vw, 332px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8884" class="wp-caption-text"><em>A little gathering of some of the electionline family at 21. Sean from Rome, Aly from Los Angeles and Kat, Mindy, Doug, Stan and Tanner in DC.</em></p></div>
<p>Those were the days when attention to election reform nationwide was at peak intensity; the 2000 Presidential election had revealed the United States’ system of election administration to be widely (wildly?) varied from state to state and locality to locality – and legislators, thought leaders and academics from coast to coast were looking at how Americans registered to vote and cast ballots, how election officials counted those votes and how the media reported the results. Pew, with its belief in the power of accurate information to inform good policy, decided to invest in an effort to track all of this activity for the benefit of the nationwide election community.</p>
<p>electionline.org – whose very first posted story was about a GAO report suggesting the military and overseas voting process could be improved – was intended to help the field wrap its proverbial hands around what was happening in election administration nationwide. The goal, as the site’s tagline suggested, was to be “your first stop for election reform information” – a daily newspaper dropped on your digital doorstep that let you know what was going on in the elections community. The idea was to provide a single, comprehensive and – most importantly &#8211; nonpartisan source for news and information about reform developments nationwide. By reading the site every day, you could learn both what was happening in specific communities as well as spot trends across the nation. This became even more important with passage of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and the release of hundreds of millions of federal dollars for state and local election administration. Over time, it was not uncommon to hear election officials say they read electionline.org every morning – both to see what was going on AND to make sure they weren’t in it!</p>
<p>The site also soon launched a weekly newsletter – cleverly entitled electionlineWeekly – which stepped back from the day-to-day and also shared summaries about research and other developments that don’t always make the news. Rumor has it that’s still going, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>electionline.org has changed offices a few times over the years and has benefitted from not only Pew’s generosity but also that of the Democracy Fund; the staff has grown and shrunk, but the commitment to the daily drumbeat of election news and information continues. There have been dozens of people who have made the commitment to this work, but all of them pale in comparison to my friend and colleague Mindy Moretti, who has literally been electionline.org for almost a decade, waking up at oh-dark-thirty to scour the Internet for what can be HUNDREDS of links per day as a presidential Election Day approaches. [We originally started with the quaint notion that we would publish one new election reform news story every weekday – sometimes I think about that and LAUGH.] [<strong>Current Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: <em>One story per day, we now average 50+ per day&#8230;as my late, great friend Jamal was famous for saying, the same things that make you laugh make you cry.</em>]</p>
<p>A bunch of us from electionline.org’s early days gathered, in person and virtually, last night to raise a glass; we toasted not only our work together and the funders who made it possible, but the support of readers like you who have kept us in business all these years. As you read this, I hope you will raise a glass of your own in celebration of everything we’ve accomplished together. I consider electionline.org to be the one thing, other than my family, of which I am proudest – and I couldn’t be happier to see it turn 21 with the promise of many, many more years serving the American election community.</p>

From displaced voters to relocating polling places to poll workers to elections offices themselves, the impacts could be large. Most immediately — other than dealing with possible damage to elections offices — county elections officials are<a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/559066-hurricane-ian-bears-down-on-florida-election-deadline/"> required to send vote-by-mail ballots to voters between 40 days and 33 days before an election. This year, that window falls between today and the next Thursday</a>. An an email to the Department of State and the Division of Elections sent before the storm, Leon County Supervisor of Elections and Florida Supervisors of Elections President Mark Earley asked if the state had any plans to provide flexibility to counties impacted by Ian. Earley told Florida Politics he sent the correspondence because, as the association head representing the state’s 67 county election officials, he had not heard any update from state election officials. Early considered the possibility of delivering ballots early, so they wouldn’t all be housed in central facilities that could be damaged. He also floated extending the window to allay fears of postal service interruptions altogether. “The entire state could be impacted in some way,” Earley told Florida Politics. “This becomes a horrible test to see how effectively the election office is able to come up with a plan on the fly,” said former elections official Ion Sancho.</p>

Pulling from existing resources, the<a href="https://issueone.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Faces_of_Democracy_Final.pdf"> guide</a> explains how U.S. elections work, what makes them free and fair, and the challenges that election workers face in doing their work. The guide also walks readers through the security, accountability, and transparency measures found at all levels of the voting process, takes a look at the key ways states and local jurisdictions differ in how they run elections, and offers a frank assessment of the way the process could be made even stronger — including a call for regular federal funding for state and local elections.</p>

<p><strong>Stadium Polling Places</strong>: A new study conducted by Rice University has found that<a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2022/voting-stadiums-wins-fans-across-america"> using sports stadiums as polling places was a big hit in 2020</a>. Voters cast their ballots at a total of 48 professional sports venues — from baseball parks to basketball arenas to soccer stadiums — as officials sought novel ways to conduct elections during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now researchers who studied stadium voting say it was so popular it should be expanded for future elections.  “Voting at sports stadiums in 2020 was an out-of-the-park home run,” said Bob Stein, the Lena Gohlman Fox Professor of Political Science at Rice. “Voters really like casting their ballots where they watch their home teams play ball. Election administrators who aren’t already opening polling places in stadiums need to seriously think about it for future elections.” After interviewing election officials and surveying voters about their experiences casting ballots at stadiums, researchers have concluded it was a strikingly popular success. In Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta, sports stadiums attracted more voters than any other polling place in their counties. “Virtually all interviewees, including election officials, conveyed overwhelming enthusiasm for the idea of stadium voting,” the researchers wrote. “They felt that the effort to convert these facilities into voting sites was overwhelmingly successful, not just in facilitating voter turnout but also in generating enthusiasm.” Researchers discovered neither political party consistently benefited from stadium voting, which was overwhelmingly popular among both Democrats and Republicans.</p>

My sincere gratitude to every Colorado high schooler who submitted a design for consideration.” In<a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/9th-grade-union-county-student-wins-i-voted-sticker-contest/SI7H3RF2ZRGRFOC3SDEURDBJTE/"> North Carolina</a>, ninth grader Hannah Metz at Central Academy of Technology won the Union County Board of Elections “I Voted” sticker contest. “Congratulations to Hannah for being awarded first place,” said Board of Elections Director Kristin Jacumin. “We encourage residents to vote in the upcoming November 8 General Election and know they will be proud to wear Hannah’s design as their I Voted sticker.” The Board of Elections received entries from Union County Public Schools, private and home-school students in grades K – 12. The top 10 entries were chosen by the Board of Elections staff. The public was then asked to vote for their favorite design.

He was 74. &#8220;He (Antonacci) was a dedicated, tenacious, and assiduous public servant, lawyer, and respected professional – a friend to all in the State of Florida,&#8221; Gov. Ron DeSantis said in the statement. Antonacci became the head of Florida&#8217;s newly created Office of Election Crimes and Security in July. The office was created as part of a voting law package approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature earlier this year. The unit reviews fraud allegations and conducts preliminary investigations, with the law requiring the governor to appoint a group of special officers from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to pursue alleged violations. Besides his most recent position, Antonacci had a decades-long resume in state government serving under Democrats and Republicans. He was appointed to various positions by Govs. Bob Graham, Jeb Bush, Charlie Crist, Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis and served as deputy attorney general under Democratic Attorney General Bob Butterworth from 1991-1997. His positions included statewide prosecutor, CEO of Enterprise Florida, a member of the Ethics Commission and executive director of the South Florida Water Management District. Former Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, who is running for governor again this fall as a Democrat, praised Antonacci&#8217;s ability to work with both parties for the good of the state. &#8220;Peter Antonacci was a dedicated and respected public servant with a long history of working with members from both sides of the aisle to better Florida,&#8221; Crist said in a statement.</p>

The bill includes provisions that were developed with input from election officials, as well as provisions from the Freedom to Vote Act, voting rights legislation led by Senator Klobuchar and supported by all Democratic Senators. The Election Worker Protection Act has received the support of a bipartisan group of current and former election officials, including former Republican Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt, who<a href="https://www.rules.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony_Schmidt.pdf"> testified</a> before the Rules Committee last year about the threats he and his family received.

<li>Direct the Department of Justice to provide training resources regarding the identification and investigation of threats to election workers;</li>
<li>Provide grants to states to support programs protecting election workers’ personally identifiable information;</li>
<li>Establish threatening, intimidating, or coercing election workers as a federal crime;</li>
<li>Expand the prohibition on voter intimidation in current law to apply to the counting of ballots, canvassing, and certification of elections;</li>
<li>Extend the federal prohibition on doxxing to include election workers; and</li>
<li>Protect the authority of election officials to remove poll observers who are interfering with or attempting to disrupt the administration of an election.</li>

According to the office of Senator Josh Newman, &#8220;SB 1131 will allow election workers to enroll in either of the state’s existing address protection programs — the Secretary of State’s Safe at Home program or the state’s address confidentiality program for public officials. &#8221; Newman&#8217;s team says the Safe at Home program is designed to protect survivors of domestic violence and people who work at reproductive healthcare facilities. The program redirects the mail of those enrolled to a different mailing address. In addition, Newsom signed a bill into law that will increase vote-by-mail ballot drop box locations at UC and CSU campuses, and increase multilingual resources and access to polling place.</p>

The legislation was amended to clarify that this would include undocumented residents in addition to those with legal permanent residency, along with two other potentially significant bills. The “Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2022” would put D.C. alongside a small number of jurisdictions — including a number of towns in Maryland like Hyattsville, Takoma Park, and Riverdale Park — that allow non-citizen legal permanent residents, also known as Green Card-holders, to vote in local elections. Advocates say that those residents pay taxes and are impacted by local policies and thus should have a say in them. D.C. has a large immigrant community, making this bill potentially impactful. One in seven residents is an immigrant, according to the American Immigration Council. A separate survey found 28% of the immigrant population — 4 percent of total population in 2016 — are undocumented. In the same session, the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety approved a measure to<a href="https://dcist.com/story/21/11/09/voting-by-mail-dc-council-charles-allen-legislation/"> make voting by mail a permanent feature of D.C. elections.</a></p>

Starting this fall, clerks in municipalities of at least 10,000 people will be able to open absentee envelopes and mark voter registration numbers in the two days before an August or November election. Ballots still can’t be tabulated – meaning votes can’t be counted – until polls open. Considering some municipalities see tens or hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots, this will speed up a “very time-consuming” process, said state Sen. Ruth Johnson, R-Holly, chair of the Senate Elections Committee and a former Secretary of State. While this means results may come in sooner on election night, Johnson stressed that preprocessing is optional for every municipality and that election results are only final after a post-election canvass. “The deal includes tightened rules for officials collecting ballots from drop boxes, and it allows election challengers and inspectors to be present for preprocessing. In the deal are<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(4dji2npad5zopmb5qjl50olj))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=2021-HB-4491"> House Bill 4491</a> requiring clerks delete dead voters from their rolls every month and more often closer to an election;<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(4dji2npad5zopmb5qjl50olj))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectname=2021-SB-0311"> Senate Bill 311</a> and<a href="http://legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/billanalysis/House/pdf/2021-HLA-0311-946FDFD1.pdf"> Senate Bill 8</a>, which allow active-duty military to cast ballots electronically; and a<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(4dji2npad5zopmb5qjl50olj))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=2022-HB-6071"> House Bill 6071</a> allowing certain privately owned locations to be polling places.</p>

The proposal would have cost the county about $63,000. &#8220;I am concerned about the fiscal hit that this will take for the one day for the few people that actually would be using it for the purpose of the polls,&#8221; said Milwaukee County Supervisor Kathleen Vincent. &#8220;County has frequently given free rides on St. Patrick’s Day.

Milwaukee County&#8217;s vote for free rides on election day failed because it needed two-thirds to pass.</p>

Snow granted an injunction on two parts of a voter registration bill that lawmakers passed in May: One section of Senate Bill 1260 would make it a felony for anyone to knowingly provide a &#8220;mechanism for voting&#8221; to someone who is registered to vote in another state. That would extend to forwarding an early ballot to that voter.  The other blocked section would require county elections officials to cancel a voter&#8217;s registration if they confirm that the voter is registered in another county. There is no requirement to notify the voter that they were dropped from the voting rolls. Snow argued that the first section was vague about what is a &#8220;mechanism for voting.&#8221; He rejected Brnovich&#8217;s contention that he would only consider a ballot or a ballot affidavit envelope as such a mechanism, but Snow noted that Brnovich can&#8217;t speak for future attorneys general, adding that Brnovich only has a few months left before his term expires. Snow blocked the portion of the law that would cancel voter registrations because, he said, it conflicts with the National Voter Registration Act. Importantly, the new law does not require any confirmation from voters themselves that they wish to drop their registration. Brnovich responded a day later, arguing the injunction will create confusion on how to carry out the ongoing general election and chastising the liberal-leaning groups that brought the lawsuit for waiting until the &#8220;11th hour&#8221; to try and stop the new law.</p>

Republican state House candidate Jody Harris asked the court to throw out primary election results in her seven-vote loss to Chad Puryear. The race in House District 25 took place in three counties: Crawford, Franklin and Washington. The lawsuit disputes the count by the Crawford County Election Commission, but was filed in Franklin County, citing Arkansas law that says an election contest of a district office may be brought in any county in the district. Certified results in all three counties together show Puryear winning 2,211 votes to Harris&#8217; 2,204 in the May 24 primary. Harris&#8217; suit disputes the counting of absentee ballots in Crawford County. By law, the suit contends, absentee ballots should have been counted first, but weren&#8217;t counted until other results were in and until a pro-Harris poll watcher demanded it. Then, they were mishandled while being counted, according to the suit. Those absentee ballots made the difference in the race, the suit contends. The suit asks the court to void the House 25 race results, but doesn&#8217;t seek specific relief beyond that. The judge hearing the case in Franklin County ruled that the case should have been filed in Crawford County but then dismissed the case rather than transferring it there. A majority of justices on the Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday said the judge was correct about where the case should be heard, but that he erroneously concluded he lacked the authority to transfer the matter. &#8220;We reverse and remand for the circuit court to utilize its discretion in determining whether to grant Harris&#8217; motion to transfer,&#8221; the court said.</p>
<p>The Pulaski County Election Commission voted to<a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2022/09/26/pulaski-election-commission-to-settle-suit-by-election-worker-fired-over-unsupported-allegation-by-former-commission-chair-kristi-stahr"> accept a settlement offer</a> in a federal civil rights lawsuit by Barry Haas over former Commission Chair Kristi Stahr’s refusal to let him work in an election because of his political beliefs. The settlement offer had several provisions. For one, Haas would dismiss the case in exchange for an opportunity to speak before the commission at a scheduled meeting and Stahr would be given notice of that meeting. The settlement details that Stahr objected to his being certified as a poll worker by saying on the record that Haas wouldn’t uphold the law. The settlement says no evidence of that was ever provided and he’d worked in elections since then.   It says that David Scott, current commission chair, would meet with Haas one-on-one about the Sept. 21 meeting at which he joined Stahr in approving a list of election workers that did not include Haas.* It provides that in the future commissioners receive training on the First and 14th Amendments and the federal law that provides an individual the right to sue state government employees for civil rights violations. The settlement will have a financial cost. It provides that the commission will pay court costs as provided by federal court rules. The commission was told by attorney Brett Taylor that the Association of Arkansas Counties s Risk Management fund would pay the cost. The county pays fees to the association. No estimate of the cost was given.</p>

Plaintiff VoteAmerica agreed to withdraw its claims in court. Signed into law in 2021, SB-202 has caused controversy. Voting rights groups allege that it limits the ability of nonprofits to distribute absentee ballot applications to Georgia voters, in violation of the First Amendment. The State of Georgia has also agreed to resolve the claims of the plaintiff, affirming that the restrictions on absentee ballot application distribution do not apply to organizations like VoteAmerica. “The team at VoteAmerica is celebrating this win for voters,” says Daniel McCarthy, VP of Finance and Operations for VoteAmerica. “VoteAmerica stands firmly in its position that Georgia’s interference in our association with and assistance to Georgia voters who request it is anti-democratic and unconstitutional.” The office of Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is also claiming a victory.</p>

More importantly, according to Rosa Lee Bichell, staff attorney with Disability Rights Advocates, “The court has now officially determined that Indiana’s current absentee voting system discriminates against voters with print disabilities.” That ruling is specific to absentee voting from home involving voters with print disabilities. The ruling stems from a case filed in late 2020 alleging Indiana’s voting system violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and deprives blind and low vision Hoosiers of their right to vote independently and privately. In their lawsuit against the Indiana Election Commission and the Indiana Secretary of state, they contend Indiana discriminates against voters who are blind or have low vision by not offering necessary accommodations. The order grants the plaintiff’s motion seeking a declaratory judgment that Indiana’s current procedures for absentee voting from home discriminate against voters with print disabilities in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. While the judge’s recent ruling still only temporarily makes the traveling board permissive rather than mandatory for the upcoming November election, “This order indicates that Indiana will need to determine a more permanent accessible solution going forward,” Bichell stated.</p>

Bonifant has ruled that the<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-maryland-ballot-counting-decision-20220923-uyck4mw6k5ebfhj3dd6hw5ulwm-story.html"> counting of mail-in ballots for the November election may begin Oct. 1</a> statewide. The ruling sides with the Maryland State Board of Elections, which filed a petition asking for emergency authorization to begin counting earlier than state law allows in hopes of avoiding delays in results like Maryland saw after the July primary. Bonifant’s opinion dismissed an argument from Republican gubernatorial nominee Dan Cox, who argued during a hearing earlier this week that such a move would violate the separation of powers established in the state constitution. Cox’s attorney also argued the situation did not constitute an emergency. Cox has not yet said whether he plans to appeal the decision.  Cox’s legal team argued that it’s up to the legislature to manage elections, a task the General Assembly took up and failed to complete. Hartman, one of Cox’s attorneys, argued Tuesday that emergencies are unforeseen circumstances. The fact the legislature months earlier contemplated issues caused by a glut of ballots shows it wasn’t an emergency, he said. Bonifant said Friday there’s “no doubt that the increased amount of mail-in ballots will have an enormous effect on the process in this election.” It’s also clear, Bonifant said, that “a situation as drastic as a declared state of emergency is not necessary for the court to act.” The judge said he believed his decision to be constitutional. “The court is satisfied the undisputed facts of this case amount to emergency circumstances envisioned by the law,” he said. Cox has<a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/09/27/cox-campaign-appeals-decision-to-allow-early-counting-of-mail-in-ballots/"> filed an appeal</a>.</p>

The complaint filed in Common Pleas Court becomes the latest attempt by Ames to accuse a governmental agency of wrongdoing regarding the Open Meetings Act. He currently has multiple appeals filed with the Supreme Court of Ohio for pending cases involving entities in Trumbull and Portage counties and other parts of the state. The latest lawsuit claimed the Columbiana County Board of Elections failed to establish a rule for notification of its meetings during its organizational meeting in March 2021 or other meeting and did not provide notice of the meetings that properly reached the general public. The lawsuit claimed that each meeting conducted without proper notice constituted a separate violation of the Open Meetings Act and any actions taken during those meetings would be invalid. The board of elections is responsible for certifying results of the elections held in the county. Additionally, the lawsuit said the minutes of the meetings failed to record the rationale behind decisions and only recorded the general topics of conversations and the roll calls, which was improper under the law. The lawsuit claimed each alleged failure to keep proper minutes for each meeting resulted in a separate violation. The court was asked to award injunctive relief and invalidation under the Open Meetings Act, meaning a $500 civil forfeiture for each violation and an order invalidating actions taken during the meetings.</p>

The action comes after requests submitted by members of South Carolina Safe Elections (SCSE) for voting data related to the 2020 election were denied by state and county election agencies. It seeks a temporary restraining order to prevent the destruction of 2020 voting data until the matter can be heard in court. In a SCSE press release, the organization said, “They are challenging their election commission’s decision to deny any access to the cast vote records (CVRs) for the 2020 election as they want to do a full analysis to ensure that there was no malfeasance.” The suit was filed in Richland County by Bluffton-based attorney Lauren Martel. It names Michael Funderburk and SCSE as the plaintiffs in the case. Martel names the South Carolina State Election Commission (SEC) and the board of elections in Aiken, Charleston, Dorchester, Greenville, Lexington, Spartanburg and York counties as defendants in the case, in addition to Beaufort County. At issue is the state’s position on whether voting records are a matter of public record. An opinion issued by the South Carolina Office of the Attorney General (AG) in September 2020 asserted that a court would likely not require the state to produce voted ballots, scanned images of voted ballots and vote cast records as the result of a FOIA request. The opinion added that the constitutional right to a secret ballot supported the conclusion that voted ballots are not open to the public.</p>

Paxton had been fighting to overturn that ruling as the issue of prosecuting election fraud has become fraught in recent years. Paxton sought to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and has aggressively pursued individual cases of fraud, outraging some voting rights advocates who see the punishments as too harsh for people who made honest mistakes. Last December, eight of the nine members on the all-GOP court struck down a law that previously allowed Paxton’s office to take on those cases without local consent. The court said the law violated the separation-of-powers clause in the Texas Constitution. The court’s decision Wednesday came with no explanation, though one judge wrote a concurring opinion. “I still agree with our original decision handed down in December, when we recognized that the specific powers given to the Attorney General by the Texas Constitution do not include the ability to initiate criminal proceedings—even in cases involving alleged violations of the Election Code,” Judge Scott Walker wrote. Two judges dissented in the case.</p>

The pair of suits, which both name several county boards and local officials as defendants, were filed last week by Angela Stewart, who served as the county’s registrar for nearly three decades until she was terminated almost exactly one year ago, and Sharon Caldwell, a longtime Nottoway officer of election who served as an assistant registrar for two years. The lawsuits — which include claims of due process violations, wrongful termination, free-speech violations and defamation — are the latest development in a long-running fight over the rural county’s elections office. With two factions lodging broad accusations of skullduggery and illegality against each other, the litigation could shed more light on who has the law on their side. The county has not yet filed a formal response, but an attorney said Nottoway expects the claims to be dismissed.</p>

The mayor&#8217;s office suggested the lawsuit, filed just two weeks after records were requested, is more about political posturing than how the city handles open records. The plaintiffs argue that comments by Johnson earlier this month about a &#8220;Milwaukee Votes 2022&#8221; campaign raised concerns about the city&#8217;s &#8220;partnership with a partisan organization to conduct get out the vote efforts or other election administration functions&#8221; ahead of the Nov. 8 election, when heated contests for governor and U.S. Senate will be on the ballot. The lawsuit, filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court, states that Johnson&#8217;s office referred further questions about the canvassing to Melissa Baldauff, a principal at GPS Impact, a communications firm. Its website touts its success in helping Democrats win elections in red states.</p>
<p>A student-run group that organizes voter mobilization efforts has filed suit in Dane County<a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/student-group-sues-to-bar-clerks-from-rejecting-absentee-ballots-missing-certain-witness-address-information"> seeking an order that would bar local clerks from rejecting absentee ballots</a> if witnesses left off bits of their addresses, such as the ZIP code. The suit seeks a declaration that a witness address is complete so long as it provides information “necessary to reasonably discern the location where the witness may be communicated with.” It also would lessen the impact of a Waukesha County judge’s ruling that bars local clerks from filling in missing information to witness addresses on absentee ballot envelopes. The suit argued that ruling created confusion for clerks because state law doesn’t define what constitutes a complete address. The Elections Commission in 2016 guidance it issued defined an address as complete when it included a street number, street name and municipality. That same guidance also laid out steps clerks could take to complete an address with readily available information without first contacting the voter.</p>

Are you prepared to be a watchdog for disabled voters in your communities? What is your newsroom doing to ensure your election coverage is useful and accessible for disabled voters? How are you covering voter rights and accessibility leading up to and on Election Day?  More than 61 million Americans live with disabilities, yet they remain underrepresented in journalism produced by U.S. newsrooms.

<p><a href="https://www.eac.gov/events/2022/10/06/path-end-end-e2e-protocols-voting-systems">The Path to End-to-End (E2E) Protocols for Voting Systems</a>:  The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), in collaboration with NIST, is initiating a process to publicly solicit, evaluate, and approve protocols used in end-to-end (E2E) cryptographically verifiable voting systems for conformance to the recently revised Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, Version 2.0.

<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/npc-headliners-book-event-major-garrett-and-david-becker-big-truth">NPC Headliners Book Event: Major Garrett and David Becker, &#8220;The Big Truth&#8221;</a>: Less than a month before the midterm elections, CBS Chief Washington Correspondent Major Garrett and David Becker, one of the nation&#8217;s leading elections experts, will discuss their new book, &#8220;The Big Truth: Upholding Democracy in the Age of THE BIG LIE,&#8221; at a National Press Club headliners book event. Garrett and Becker&#8217;s new book examines the potentially dire consequences for the 2022 midterms and beyond. Filled with interviews with key players — election workers, January 6th Committee members Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md), Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and more — they take a close look at what is known as the Big Lie. Garrett, a veteran Washington correspondent, and Becker, the Executive Director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Integrity, make a case that Big Lie “fraud” allegations evaporate under scrutiny. The authors examine what actually happened in 2020, while reporting on what they call each Trumpian misdirection designed to con and beguile Americans into chasing phantom allegations of election crimes. The authors argue that the next midterm and presidential elections will test American democracy more severely than at any time since the Civil War, arguing that how Americans react may determine whether the country is led into another war against itself. The program will include a question-and-answer session with Garrett and Becker. <strong>When:</strong> October 11. <strong>Where:</strong> National Press Club, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><a href="https://voteearlyday.org/">Vote Early Day</a>: Vote Early Day is a nonpartisan movement of media companies, businesses, nonprofits, election administrators, and creatives working to ensure all Americans have the tools to vote early. This holiday is a tentpole moment for partners of all stripes to engage with voters and urge them to cast their ballots. Created in 2020, Vote Early Day has brought thousands of national and local partners together in celebration and activation to increase the number of people voting early. This collaborative, open-source model—similar to Giving Tuesday and National Voter Registration Day—ensures that millions more Americans take advantage of their options to vote early through on the ground activations, get-out-the-vote pushes, national communications on traditional and social media, and efforts to create a new culture around voting. Vote Early Day plays a unique role in the push to get voters to cast their ballot. We are a trusted, nonpartisan holiday with supporters on both sides of the aisle. We provide a central moment for a wide range of partners (many non- traditional to the civic space) to engage with voters and urge them to vote early. Our collaboration of thousands of diverse partners allows us to engage in places beyond where voters are used to seeing election messages. This allows us to break through the noise and meet voters where they are. <strong>When:</strong> October 28</p>
