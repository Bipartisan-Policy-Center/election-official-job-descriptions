							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Elections: A Love Story</strong><br />
<em>“We are the same type of weird”</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8029" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat1-300x276.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="276" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat1-300x276.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat1-1024x941.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat1-768x706.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat1.jpg 1188w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Like many Americans, Hina Patel was looking for a way to be part of the historic 2020 election. The Atlanta-area pharmacist decided that being a poll watcher was a great way to get involved and try something new.</p>
<p>Jeff Danovich, a nationally recognized election trainer, was serving as a poll manager for early voting at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Being a first time poll watcher, Patel wasn’t really sure what to expect on that October day.</p>
<p>“I was really nervous; not knowing how the day would unfold and what to expect,” Patel said.</p>
<p>As a long-time election official, Danovich wasn’t expecting anything out of the ordinary either.</p>
<p>“I thought it would be just an ordinary early voting day. Initially I thought the only thing of consequence would be to deal with the crazy, homeless man who was outside the polling location spouting misinformation,” Danovich said.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8030" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat2-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat2-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One thing neither of them were necessarily looking for that October in 2020 was love.</p>
<p>“I was not looking at all,” Patel said. “As someone who has been single for the majority of my adult life, meeting someone was the furthest thing on my mind.”</p>
<p>But fate has a funny way of working and what happened is an elections-style meet cute.</p>
<p>“During this time of COVID, when everyone was masking up, I only saw his bespectacled blue eyes. He introduced himself to me and my Republican counterpart,” Patel said. “He shared his background and what really caught my attention was when he talked about his Master’s thesis about Post-election Violence. As a ‘dorkaphile’, I immediately checked his ring finger. “</p>
<p>While they were both at the polling site to work, Danovich said there was some “low-key flirting throughout the day, which Danovich said there are no rules against.</p>
<p>“I noticed he was glancing at me an awful lot that afternoon along with ‘discovering’ reasons to come talk to me,” Patel said.</p>
<p>One of those “reasons” was to try and encourage Patel to become a poll worker, and snag her digits too of course.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8031" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat3-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat3-225x300.jpg 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat3-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat3-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat3-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/DanPat3-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />“I told her that if she was interested in becoming a poll worker, she should take one of my classes (my dorky way of admitting I wanted to see her again).,” Danovich said. “As the polls were closing for the day, she said she’d be interested in taking my class and she asked for my phone number. In her contacts, she listed me as  ‘Jeff Danovich Democratic Party’. I asked her to change it because, as Election Officials, we cannot be associated with any political party. So she changed it to ‘Jeff Danovich Party’. I reciprocated and listed her in my contacts as ‘Hina Patel Party’. We laughed and she asked if my wife would be upset with the choice of contact names, and I said ‘I haven’t had to worry about a wife for five years, so I think it’ll be all right’.”</p>
<p>The two communicated back and forth for about a week before their first official date and made plans for their second date the very next night.</p>
<p>“It just so happened to be right after her shift as a poll watcher at the same early voting site. The plan was to just “pop in” at Early Voting and we would walk together (without trying to be obvious I was only there for her) to a local restaurant for dinner,” Danovich said. “As hard as we tried to not make it obvious, my poll manager friend … texted me the next day and asked, “Did you and that poll watcher go out on a date yesterday after the polls closed?’ I said yes and she said we look ‘…super cute together…’”</p>
<p>Although Patel never signed up to take one of Danovich&#8217;s poll worker training classes she&#8217;s got her eyes on the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did online training as a poll watcher for the Democratic Party of Georgia. I have not signed up for the 2022 cycle,&#8221; Patel said. &#8220;More than likely, I will sign up as a worker&#8211;not watcher&#8211;for the 2024 cycle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest as they say is history. And because this a love story for our times, given her work in the medical field, Patel was able to administer Danovich his first two COVID shots.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3788" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/VoterRegGroups-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="189" />Fighting Disinformation</strong>: Last week we reported that, citing concerns about funding sources and pressure from outside sources, Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin (R) pulled the state from ERIC effectively immediately. This week, NPR has a piece about how<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/09/1076529761/right-wing-conspiracies-have-a-new-target-a-tool-that-fights-actual-voter-fraud"> right-wing conspiracy theorists are threatening the data-sharing system</a>. According to NPR, On Jan. 20, the far-right blog The Gateway Pundit published the first of a number of articles about the program, falsely implying it is part of a left-wing election conspiracy. Seven days later, Louisiana withdrew its membership. One candidate running for Alabama secretary of state has already threatened to pull the state from the system, however current Secretary of State John Merrill supports ERIC. &#8220;It helps identify duplicate registrations,&#8221; Merrill said. &#8220;It helps identify dual participation in elections. That&#8217;s a concern [and] there&#8217;s no other way that any state in the union can do that independently of ERIC.&#8221; David Becker of the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research told NPR that t&#8217;s because election deniers don&#8217;t actually want voting to be more secure or efficient. It&#8217;s the same reason, he says, they often oppose ballot drop boxes even though they are considered a more secure way to return mail ballots than using the Postal Service. &#8220;They don&#8217;t care about actual integrity,&#8221; Becker said. &#8220;They only care that their side wins. That is the most anti-democratic idea that I can imagine.&#8221;</p>

According to Nebraska Examiner, Evnen’s presentation called attention to several rumors about irregularities in the 2020 election.  The PowerPoint stated, “The Secretary of State’s Office is fully informed of the concerns and claims that have been raised and has fully investigated them.” In a recent legislative committee hearing, the Nebraska Voter Accuracy Project stated Evnen’s office wasn’t listening and that they underestimated the people they believe committed fraud. The group also claimed the state’s election counting machines aren’t tested for accuracy, which Evnen calls entirely false.  He says the state spent $7 million in 2019 to update its ballot counting system. Evnen rejected allegations that more than 4,000 votes could not be linked to registered voters as well.  The PowerPoint explains voter registration lists are updated almost daily, showing some differences can be attributed to people dying in the months following the election.</p>

The colt is owned by Klaravich Stables, Inc. and trained by Chad Brown. He was bred by Three Chimneys Farm. His most recent race, was the Withers Stakes at Aqueduct which he won. “He&#8217;s a horse that&#8217;s going to progress with each race. Each race is going to propel him, and we&#8217;ve seen that in the morning with him. He was very impressive in his works. Especially, in his last two works leading up to this,” Dan Stupp, assistant trainer told Thoroughbred Daily News. “He&#8217;s an exciting horse and I was really ready to see him run today. I think he&#8217;ll move forward nicely in his 3-year-old year.” According to The TwinSpires Edge, Early Voting has an <a href="https://edge.twinspires.com/racing/kentucky-derby-pedigree-profile-early-voting/">excellent pedigree</a> to make him a Derby contender. There’s still a lot of time till Saturday May 7, but we’ll be keeping an eye on Early Voting and fortunately, bipartisan legislation was signed into law in Kentucky in 2021<a href="https://apnews.com/article/bills-legislation-elections-kentucky-coronavirus-pandemic-cfae45798b5dee94f52a7782a562509a"> expanding early voting</a>.</p>

														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-7060" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="186" height="248" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" />Federal Legislation</strong>: The House has approved legislation that will<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/08/us/politics/postal-service-overhaul-house.html"> significantly overhaul the U.S. Postal Service</a> for the first time in nearly 20 years. To address the financial strain on the agency, the bill requires retired employees to enroll in Medicare when they are eligible and removes a mandate, first imposed by a 2006 law, that the agency cover its future health care costs decades in advance. The Postal Service estimates that those two changes will save the agency about $50 billion over a decade. The measure also would require the agency to publish delivery data that customers could search using a street address, ZIP code or post office box, as well as mandating the agency maintain a delivery standard of at least six days a week. The bill also would expand special rates for local newspaper distribution, and would also require regular reports to Congress about the agency’s financial state. The House approved the measure 342 to 92. A<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/us/politics/postal-service-reform-legislation.html"> companion bill</a> in the evenly divided Senate has bipartisan backing, including more than a dozen Republican co-sponsors, signaling sufficient support for the measure to move through that chamber and become law.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3748" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Arizona:</strong> Arizona Republicans advanced legislation to unwind the state’s overwhelmingly popular early voting system by<a href="https://apnews.com/article/elections-arizona-voting-donald-trump-election-2020-1acfff3191b1b4d4ad4099a94ca9b945"> requiring that voters have a reason and make a request to vote by mail</a>. The measure aims to steer most voters toward in-person balloting on Election Day, a method used by just 10% of voters in 2020. It would eliminate the Automatic Early Voting List, which allows voters to get a ballot in the mail before every election, and nix in-person early voting and emergency voting before Election Day.  The measure was approved in party-line votes of the Senate Government Committee, setting up a potential debate in the full Senate in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Arizonans for Free and Fair Elections is looking to<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1754584/az-group-looking-add-measure-ballot-protect-early-voting-rules"> restore the permanent early voting list</a> that lawmakers modified in Arizona last year. The local coalition has taken steps to repeal laws that limit who can deliver an early ballot to the polls and ensure people can cast them the weekend before Election Day.  Initiative organizer Joel Edman says the larger goal of the group is to prevent measures, like those that would permanently remove millions from the early voting list, in the Legislature. &#8220;The goal here is to be nonpartisan and advocate for policies that are going to benefit all voters in the state, regardless of their party, and protect our democracy for all of us so that we can get results that actually reflect the needs of our communities,&#8221; Edman said.  The group is working to put the initiative on the November ballot, which would also prevent lawmakers from handing election equipment and ballots to unqualified firms.</p>

The “Election Official Protection Act” would expand on existing law to “make clear that it is a crime to intimidate, threaten, or coerce &#8211; or to attempt to intimidate, threaten or coerce &#8211; an election official while they are performing official duties,” said Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold. The bill, sponsored by state Representatives Monica Duran and Emily Sirota, both Democrats, also makes it a crime to retaliate against election officials “for the performance of official duties.” And it gives election workers greater protections against “doxing,” the public release of information such as home addresses or other private identifying information, often to facilitate harassment.

Under current Florida law, only municipal and charter county officers can face a voter recall. Of note, 20 of Florida’s 67 counties operate under county charters. Under Florida law, “county officers” include each county’s Clerk of Courts, Property Appraiser, Sheriff, Supervisor of Elections and Tax Collector. If the legislation is passed, voters would have to collect signatures from 15% of a county’s registered voters to trigger a recall election.</p>

The presentation would show students the steps required to register to vote online. The bill would require the Division of Elections to prepare certain materials and make such materials readily available to each public high school. The bill would allow students to opt out and prohibits teachers from pressuring, requiring, or otherwise incentivizing a student to take certain actions.

One bill, House Bill 549, is a voter identification bill that sponsors are calling the Secure Election Act.  If passed into law, House Bill 549 would make it so that Idahoans would no longer have the option to sign a voter affidavit verifying their identity at the polls on Election Day. That bill would also make it so that student IDs would no longer be an acceptable form of ID to vote, though the bill would add the ability to use a concealed weapons permit that displays the permit holder’s date of birth and Idaho address.  The bill would also eliminate same-day voter registration. Under the bill, if a voter cannot produce an ID, they would be given an provisional ballot, which would be kept separate, the voter would have until 10 days following the election to present proper ID to the county clerk and have their ballot counted. Provisional ballots that are not validated would be marked spoiled and not counted. Under the bill, the only acceptable form of IDs would be: A current Idaho driver’s license or state ID; A current U.S. passport; A current active military ID card; A current tribal ID card issued by a federally recognized Native American tribe; and A current Idaho license to carry concealed weapons that displays the permit holder’s date of birth and address in Idaho. The bill contains an emergency clause, which would make it effective the date it is signed into law. Normally, bills that do not contain an emergency clause take effect on July 1, the first day of the state’s fiscal year. The emergency clause ensures the bill would be in effect for the spring primaries if it becomes law. House Majority Leader Mike Moyle, R-Star- is pushing a rewritten version of the so-called anti ballot-harvesting bill from 2021.  The new bill is<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2022/legislation/H0547/"> House Bill 547</a>, and the legislation makes it illegal to knowingly collect and return someone else’s absentee ballot. The previous version of Moyle’s bill passed the Idaho House last year but was never considered by the Idaho Senate. This bill would still make it a felony to turn in more than 10 other people’s ballots or if the person turning in the ballots was paid by anyone other than the voter.  The House State Affairs Committee voted to introduce House Bill 547, which clears the way for it to return to the committee for a full public hearing.  The bill also contains an emergency clause, which would make it effective the date it is signed into law.</p>
<p>The Senate State Affairs Committee advanced a bill this week that would require<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/02/09/idaho-senate-committee-approves-post-election-audits-bill/"> post-election audits</a> of a random selection of counties after a general or primary election.<a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2022/legislation/S1274/"> Senate Bill 1274</a> was introduced to the committee by Deputy Secretary of State Jason Hancock, who said the audits would increase public confidence in election results, and it’s a practice that many states have already implemented. Under the new bill, the audits would be open to attendance by media personnel, candidates and representatives from political parties. The exact procedures for the audits would be developed with county clerks, according to the bill text. Counties would be randomly selected each year according to population, with a certain number from counties with populations between 10,000 and 100,000 people and counties with more than 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Sen. Grant Burgoyne (D-Boise) has introduced Senate Bill 1230 which would allow for<a href="https://lmtribune.com/opinion/burgoyne-introduces-ranked-voting-to-skeptical-colleagues/article_86594207-927f-539f-877e-459200767b1f.html"> ranked choice voting</a>. Burgoyne’s measure would set up a nonpartisan primary for federal through county offices (except president). There, “The top four vote getters in the nonpartisan primary will be nominated and placed on the general election ballot. At the general election, voters will have the opportunity to rank their choices for each of these offices from first to fourth.”</p>

The Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee voted unanimously to approve a bill that would make the intentional interference, intimidation or violence against a municipal election official a Class D crime, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The proposal was backed by the Maine Town Clerks&#8217; Association and individual election officials who told the committee last month that they have witnessed increasing harassment and hostility directed at election procedures. The bill approved by the committee was amended to reduce the proposed crime from a Class C felony to a misdemeanor after defense attorneys and the Maine ACLU warned that it went too far. But the committee did add the crime to the list of offenses that can be prosecuted under state election law, which would involve the Office of Attorney General. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows says that moving threats against clerks into that part of the law &#8220;gives it a statewide importance and focus that by necessity, one hopes, will influence the prosecution, particularly depending on the circumstance if it&#8217;s a disruption in the polling place.&#8221; The change also puts election clerk threats in the same category as voter or election fraud.</p>

Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery) includes several reforms aimed at mail-in ballots, which surged in popularity during the unconventional 2020 election. Kagan’s bill also would allow local boards of elections to begin processing mail-in ballots eight days before early voting, although local election officials wouldn’t be able to release any preliminary mail-in ballot results until after polls close on Election Day. Under current Maryland law, voters who don’t sign the oath on a mailed-in ballot have their ballot automatically rejected. Under Kagan’s bill, voters would be allowed to provide a signature via “a digital picture message” by phone or email, an online portal, by text message, by mail or by an in-person visit to their local board of elections’ office.</p>

Robert Clements of Elmwood, would establish statewide standards for counties that employ ballot drop boxes. The bill would require drop boxes to be: securely fastened to the ground or on a concrete slab connected to the ground; secured with a lock that can be opened only by the county election commissioner, county clerk or an election official designated by the commissioner or clerk; compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act; emptied each business day; and opened for accepting ballots no later than the sixth Friday before a statewide election or the fourth Friday before a special election. The measure also would require a county election commissioner or county clerk to inform the Nebraska Secretary of State of each drop box location in the county no later than 42 days prior to a statewide election. Wayne Bena, deputy secretary of state for elections, testified in support of LB1263. All county election commissioners were provided with drop boxes for the 2020 primary election, he said, but the department currently lacks authority to regulate their use. The bill would ensure that all drop boxes comply with state standards, Bena said.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are considering a bill that would<a href="https://fox42kptm.com/news/local/lawmakers-consider-bill-to-restore-felon-voting-rights-sooner-jason-whitmer-aclu-lb158"> restore Nebraskans’ right to vote</a> immediately after they complete their felony sentences, instead of having to wait two years. ACLU Nebraska Board Member Jason Whitmer said LB158 would encourage more people re-entering society to educate themselves about programs that impact their families, and to get more involved in improving communities. Backers of the two-year waiting period have argued that it provides a carrot to encourage good behavior when people re-enter communities, and helps reduce recidivism.</p>

The funding request, passed unanimously by members of the Interim Finance Committee on Wednesday, comes from the secretary of state’s office and was described by Deputy Secretary of State for Elections Mark Wlaschin as the list of necessities to successfully implement new mail voting requirements for the 2022 election. The additional funding comes on top of $12.2 million already allocated by lawmakers last year as part of<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/81st2021/Bill/7842/Text"> AB321</a>, the bill implementing the move to permanent, expanded mail voting. Under the law, which was opposed by all legislative Republicans, every active registered voter will be sent a mail ballot before a primary or general election. Inactive voters, who are legally registered to vote but don’t have a current address on file with election officials, will not be sent a mail ballot. According to a memorandum submitted to lawmakers, the requested $2.2 million would be split between the secretary of state’s office and county election clerks for the cost of ballot drop boxes, ballot tracking software, signature curing software, ballot sorting equipment and increased pay and signature verification training for poll workers.</p>

Counties receive $125 from the state towards election workers’ $200 payment, making up the balance of $75.  This would not change under the new law: counties would continue to pay $75, but the state would reimburse them $225.  For election workers covering a school election “held at a time other than the general election,” their hourly rate would rise from $14.29 to $19.64.</p>

In addition, qualified electors would be automatically registered to vote after completing a transaction at the Motor Vehicle Division, though they could opt out afterward.

The bill would require every county to provide early-voting locations for two weeks before Election Day, with set hours of 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. They must open more than one location. The minimum number would vary by county, using a formula that involves total square miles and the number of registered voters, spaced at least 10 miles apart.

The amendment, introduced by House Majority Whip Brandon Newton, R-Lancaster, and adopted 75-39 largely along party lines, changed portions of a bill that firmed up the oversight and authority of South Carolina’s State Election Commission to add a prohibition on ballot drop boxes and expand the array of election audits the state can perform, among other things. The bill adopted Tuesday, which had been sitting in the House since it was amended late last session by the Senate, now returns to the upper chamber, which must decide whether to accept the House change or to convene a small panel of House members and senators and hash out the differences.</p>

The proposal, pitched by District 3 Rep. Drew Dennert, R-Aberdeen, seeks to move just the presidential primary to the Tuesday following the first Monday in March. The decision to seek a fiscal note was the third vote with votes to pass and defer to the 41st Legislative Day both ending in a tie vote. Dennert, who is prime sponsor on the bill, proposed the change to give South Dakota more of a voice in selecting the presidential candidate. House Bill 1116 seeks to establish the March election date only for the presidential race every four years, essentially creating two primary election dates for South Dakota with other primary election races, like those for the legislature, still happening in June. Included in the bill would be a requirement the state reimburse counties for the cost of the elections. Dennert said that would be an estimated $1 million to $2 million.</p>

First-time voters would have to show their driver license or state identification card at the polling place or include a copy of these identifications with their mail-in ballots,<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/HB0313.html"> HB313</a> states. The lieutenant governor’s office would also have to develop security requirements for Utah elections officials, relating to the handling and “documentation of custody” of ballots. Election officials would have to sign an affidavit after every election, certifying that they complied with these rules and have properly maintained the voter rolls under their supervision. The state would also have to create minimum standards for vendors that print ballots in Utah and establish “software validation procedures” meant to ensure no one can tamper with voter files. Video cameras would be stationed near each ballot drop box with a sign posted nearby to notify people that the premises are monitored around the clock. The bill would require the lieutenant governor’s office to audit the state’s voter registration records on at least a yearly basis; mandate that local election officials keep detailed records for maintenance work on voting machines; and prohibit tabulation machines or ballot scanners from ever being connected to the internet.</p>
<p>A House committee abruptly yanked a bill dealing with<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2022/02/09/utah-house-committee/"> ranked-choice voting</a> off their agenda Wednesday afternoon.<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/HB0178.html"> HB178</a> from Rep. Mike Winder, R-West Valley City, expands the use of ranked-choice voting in primary and general elections with more than two candidates. Last year 23 Utah cities used the system during their municipal elections as part of a pilot program. Lawmakers have faced withering pressure from opponents who organized an email and text messaging pressure campaign on right-wing social media and messaging apps, many of which are focused on baseless conspiracy theories about rampant election fraud. That appears to have paid off with the cancellation of Wednesday’s House Government Operations Committee hearing. According to the Salt Lake Tribune, opponents packed the committee room before the hearing anticipating a chance to speak against the proposal. The last-minute change dashed those plans.</p>

Glenn Youngkin is backing, would expand the board from five to eight members and also strip the governor’s authority to pick the commissioner of the Department of Elections and give it to the board.  The legislation wouldn’t go into effect until 2023 if passed by the House of Delegates and signed by Youngkin, giving the governor time to replace the outgoing elections commissioner. The board would be split between members representing the political party of the governor and the party that received the second most votes in a governor’s race. If the expanded board reaches a tie in a decision, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia will appoint a retired judge to break the 4-4 split. While the board would have the power to hire and replace the elections commissioner, any such decision would require at least five of the eight board members to agree.</p>
<p>Republicans in the House of Delegates<a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/capitol-connection/republican-bills-to-roll-back-voting-access-head-for-final-house-vote/"> advanced several bills</a> to roll back new voting laws. One proposal would discard absentee ballots that arrive in the mail after polls close. Currently, a vote is counted if it’s postmarked on or before election day and received by noon on the third day after the election. A separate bill would shorten the in-person early voting period from 45 days to two weeks but expands poll hours to 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. each day.</p>

The crime is currently a misdemeanor. The bill passed the House of Delegates with no opposition on Thursday. Six delegates were absent.</p>
<p>The House Political Subdivisions Committee approved the third bill in three weeks dealing with local elections. This one, HB 4353, is a 78-page bill that<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/house-committee-gives-first-ok-033000293.html"> requires nearly all local elections to be held on the same date as statewide elections</a>. It also does away with local special elections and requires them to be held during statewide primary or general elections. The previous two bills set up procedures to enable city and county voters to overturn city and county ordinances. All three were originally on a single agenda for the committee&#8217;s first meeting but couldn&#8217;t be handled in a single hour. This one generated less heat. Committee counsel explained some of the many details spread among the bill&#8217;s 78 pages. For example, for local levies that expire in an off year, the levying body may set a special election to extend or renew the levy until the next statewide election. Terms of local officials elected in off years or off months may be adjusted to conform with new dates. Local school boards will likewise have to hold special elections to extend board terms. The bill will still allow statewide bond elections to be held in off years, in order for the state to react quickly to situations, counsel explained.</p>

Currently comprised of three Democrats and three Republicans, the commission has recently deadlocked on contentious issues like guidance on whether clerks can place additional drop boxes for absentee ballots. Bernier said she is drafting a bill that would require both Republican and Democratic legislative leaders to agree on a list of four retired judges with whom they&#8217;d be comfortable serving as a seventh commissioner. Bernier said her proposal would then call for the list of retired judges to go before the state supreme court.</p>

The vote to temporarily stay a lower court order blocking the map was 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the court&#8217;s three liberals in dissent. The decision means Alabama will not immediately have to redraw its political lines to include a second majority-Black district, as had been ordered by a District Court judge, allowing the original maps to take effect for midterm elections. At the same time, the Supreme Court&#8217;s majority said it would take up the Alabama redistricting case on the merits later this year. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in a statement concurring with the decision, argued that the court should stay out of the political process so close to an election, insisting the decision makes &#8220;no new law regarding the Voting Rights Act&#8221; and simply allows time for a full briefing and oral argument.  &#8220;That decision does a disservice to our own appellate processes, which serve both to constrain and to legitimate the Court’s authority. It does a disservice to the District Court, which meticulously applied this Court’s longstanding voting-rights precedent,&#8221; Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the dissent.. &#8220;And most of all, it does a disservice to Black Alabamians who under that precedent have had their electoral power diminished—in violation of a law this Court once knew to buttress all of American democracy.&#8221;</p>

In new legal filings, attorney Roopali Desai said Brnovich is pursuing “unfounded and unprecedented enforcement action” against Hobbs, threatening her with criminal prosecution “for performing her duties as the state’s chief elections officer.” And she wants Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Joan Sinclair to block Brnovich from initiating any civil or criminal complaints against Hobbs. The fight is over the E-Qual system, first established in 2011, which allows candidates to get signatures they need for nomination online. Due to redistricting, Hobbs said she needs to take the system offline o account for those new districts, as the voter registration system — the one that determines if signers live within the districts of those they are supporting — cannot accommodate more than one set of maps. So that means the system will not be available for those running for Congress or the legislature. That led to a letter from Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Wright warning that any move to do so would be “contrary to law,” floating the possibility that Hobbs could be charged with a Class 3 misdemeanor —and jailed for up to 30 days and fined $500 — for knowingly refusing to perform a duty required under state election laws. Wright said that the refusal to keep E-Qual online could be a felony that carries a penalty of a year in state prison. “This threat against the secretary is not only legally baseless, but also dangerous,” Desai wrote. And she sees a political motive.</p>

Jones said that he would consider the risks to voter confusion and confidence before ruling on lawsuits alleging Georgia’s redistricting discriminated against Black voters in violation of the Voting Rights Act. Delaying the primary could potentially allow Jones to address concerns raised by the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative justices in a redistricting decision earlier this week. The high court put on hold a lower court ruling that Alabama was required to draw new congressional districts to increase Black voting power, in part because there’s little time to craft new maps before the May 24 primary. “I could change the whole calendar,” Jones said. “I need to hear all the evidence before I make a decision,” likely soon after court hearings conclude early next week.</p>

In a 5-2 decision,<a href="https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=184176"> judges wrote</a> that Missouri citizens&#8217; right to overturn laws passed by the Legislature is a “fundamental expression of the power held by the people.” “The legislature must not be permitted to use procedural formalities to interfere with or impede this constitutional right that is so integral to Missouri’s democratic system of government,” Judge Mary Russell wrote. In Missouri, referendum petitions must be submitted to the Secretary of State’s Office 90 days after the end of the legislative session during which the law passed. A 1997 state law requires petitions to contain an official ballot title certified by the secretary of state, and another law sets forth procedural deadlines for the secretary of state to approve that ballot title. The American Civil Liberties Union and the group No Bans No Choice sought to overturn those rules after Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft used all of his allotted time to approve the ballot title, leaving petition gatherers with just two weeks to collect hundreds of thousands of signatures. Ashcroft had argued that even with such a tight turnaround time, it&#8217;s still possible to collect enough signatures to put a law to a referendum vote. But Russell wrote that especially for people who can&#8217;t afford to pay workers to gather signatures, the deadlines are a hurdle to access the referendum process.</p>

Meanwhile, ID critics continue to push to have the case moved to the N.C. Supreme Court. “This State’s Constitution provides that ‘[v]oters offering to vote in person shall present photographic identification before voting’ and that the General Assembly ‘shall enact general laws governing the requirements of such photographic identification, which may include exceptions,&#8217;” according to a brief from attorney Nicole Moss, representing legislative leaders. “The General Assembly enacted Senate Bill 824 … to implement this mandate.” “Two judges on a divided three-judge Superior Court panel have now permanently enjoined S.B. 824 as a violation of North Carolina’s Equal Protection Clause,” the legislators’ brief added. “But they could do so only by failing to honor the presumption of legislative good faith and by implausibly concluding that a General Assembly bent on entrenching itself through a racially targeted voter-ID law would pass a law that does not prevent anyone from voting and do so with the support of several members of the party allegedly targeted.” In a separate brief, lawyers working for N.C. Attorney General Josh Stein also defended the voter ID law. “It was Plaintiffs’ contention that by passing S.B. 824, the Republican majority of our legislature attempted to disenfranchise African Americans, who historically support Democratic candidates, as a mechanism to entrench itself politically,” according to the brief from Special Deputy Attorney General Terence Steed. “The majority of the three-judge panel in this case agreed and concluded that ‘the enactment of S.B. 824 was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters.’ This conclusion was erroneous.”</p>

The federal lawsuit alleges violations of the Voting Rights Act. North Dakota’s Republican-controlled Legislature in November approved a new legislative map. It separates the state House districts on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation in northern North Dakota and the Fort Berthold reservation, in the heart of the state’s oil patch in the western part of the state and home to the Three Affiliated Tribes. Some tribal members and lawmakers said the move would increase the odds for tribes to elect their own members to the Legislature. Turtle Mountain argues the split House districts “packs” and “cracks” tribal members into a single house district on its reservation, while diluting their vote by non-native voters in the non-reservation subdistrict. Spirit Lake alleges the new redistricting map dilutes American Indian voters on and near its reservation. North Dakota Secretary of State Al Jaeger told the Associated Press he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it.</p>

Instead, the high court noted it was hearing oral argument on Feb. 18 in a case that will determine the lines of congressional districts. Philadelphia’s elections officials posted on Twitter that the ruling applies to all nomination petitions. In the congressional redistricting case, a lower court judge on Monday recommended a new map of the state’s 17 congressional districts and suggested alterations to the petition gathering period.

The suit alleges the secretary of state is violating the National Voter Registration Act by refusing to turn over documents related to the program. “The Texas secretary is once again improperly trying to purge voters from voter rolls [and is] ensnaring a ton of naturalized citizens in its efforts,” said Ashley Harris, a lawyer with the ACLU of Texas. “[They are] targeting largely communities of color in Texas who have just as much of a right to vote as everyone else.” The elections law passed last year by the Legislature requires the secretary of state to do regular sweeps of the voter rolls to verify voters’ citizenship status. This new iteration of a voter purge program follows a similar attempt made in 2019. That program was halted after it came out that the office was relying on out-of-date records and would have wrongly canceled thousands of voter registrations of legal Texas voters. The groups suing say they cannot determine if the secretary of state’s office is following the rules set by the 2019 settlement without the documents. The secretary of state’s office declined to comment on the lawsuit but did point to documents on its website detailing the citizenship verification process. About 11,000 voters have been flagged as potential non-citizens this time around, and about 2,500 registrations were canceled as of Dec. 31, 2021.</p>

The 4-3 ruling by the court against Kleefisch, who is running for governor, comes as justices are already considering a separate lawsuit challenging the use of drop boxes in Wisconsin. t was the latest in a series of election cases where conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn provided the swing vote, joining the court&#8217;s liberals to reject Kleefisch&#8217;s original action petition.

The court&#8217;s other three conservatives dissented, with conservative Justice Patience Roggensack writing that the court had &#8220;sidestepped&#8221; its responsibility. &#8220;The legality of absentee ballot guidance from (the Wisconsin Elections Commission) has been simmering since 2020, and will likely continue until we thoroughly address absentee ballot issues generated by WEC,&#8221; Roggensack said. &#8220;Because Wisconsin voters deserve elections conducted in a manner that we have reviewed and approved, I would grant Kleefisch&#8217;s petition to commence an original action.&#8221;</p>

Monica Evans, director of the DCBOE testified at a DC Council oversight hearing that the DMV is not providing the necessary data. “If we are essentially kicked out of ERIC that means we will not be able to take advantage of that data that comes from other states,” said Evans. “This is a tool to help those member states update voter rolls as much as they can. That is the gold standard… in terms of getting information from other states. Which is why states are joining ERIC. It helps all of us provide the most accurate voter rolls we can.” Evans also told the council that the DMV told her last week that it would need a $2,000 monthly payment to provide the data the elections board needs, the first time any such payment was brought up. “We’re kind of reaching the end of our ability to sort of accommodate and be patient with the DMV as they try to work through this and figure it out,” Shane Hamlin with ERIC told DCist. “It is jeopardizing the District’s membership in ERIC. Not getting D.C.’s DMV data is harming other states’ ability to maintain good, accurate voter rolls. And it’s certainly harming the District’s ability to update records and have good, strong, accurate voter rolls.”</p>

Public information about voters was posted to an online forum, but the breach didn’t involve Social Security numbers or driver’s license numbers, said Charles Davis, chief financial officer for<a href="https://www.easyvotesolutions.com/"> EasyVote</a>. Voter registration information can include names, addresses, races and dates of birth. EasyVote’s software isn’t connected to Georgia voter registration computers. Voter information may have been obtained from an EasyVote online storage location, Davis said. It’s unclear how many voters were affected by the breach, which EasyVote learned about on Jan. 31. “Upon learning that the files had been made available, EasyVote immediately started an investigation,” Davis said. “EasyVote quickly disabled access to that storage location and transferred the data to a new environment with additional security controls.”</p>

This information included copies of Social Security cards and driver’s license number. State and federal law enforcement are investigating. Beaufort County used the company’s system to upload hiring documents, which included poll workers’ personally identifiable information (PII), Whitmire said. “We’re not aware of any other county that used the system in that way,” Elections Commission spokesman Chris Whitmire said. “Any time any individual’s PII is compromised, it’s a big deal. It’s not acceptable. We, as government administrators who are charged with protecting information, we have to follow through with that. We see that as an important part of what we do.” The S.C. Law Enforcement Division notified Beaufort County’s voter registration office about the data breach last Wednesday, said Chris Ophardt, Beaufort County spokesperson. Because the breach involved data in at least Georgia and South Carolina, the Federal Bureau of Investigation also is involved in the investigation, he said.</p>
