														<p><strong>Countdown to Election Day 2022: A Resource Guide</strong><br />
<em>A round-up of resources for the coming weeks</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8343" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Elections officials have been bombarded with a lot in the last two years — records requests, mis/disinformation, threats, questions about the integrity of the system, etc.</p>
<p>They’ve also been given a lot of tools to help deal with all of it from communications to cyber and physical security to personnel issues.</p>
<p>Needless to say it can all be a bit overwhelming.  With just over 30 days till the 2022 Midterm Election, we pulled together what we hope is a helpful resource guide for state and local elections officials. A one-stop, if you will.</p>
<p>Thanks to the folks at Alliance for Security Democracy, Brennan Center, Bipartisan Policy Center, Bridging Divides Initiative, Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, Center for Tech and Civic Life, CISA, The Elections Group, National Association for Media Literacy Education, and National Association of State Election Directors for all the work they’ve done for elections officials and for providing the resources here.</p>
<p><strong>Audits</strong><br />
<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/bipartisan-principles-for-election-audits/">Bipartisan Principles for Election Audits</a>: Audits and reviews happen at each stage of the voting process. Local election officials conduct logic and accuracy testing, which is a check of voting systems before voting begins to ensure proper functionality. Politics and potential motives aside, the rise of unofficial election reviews prompts a need for a reckoning—begging the questions: What is the purpose of audits? How should audits be conducted? What makes an audit deserving of public trust?  — Bipartisan Policy Center</p>
<p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/61da19f9986c0c0a9fd8435f/t/620e599548201f38d44ada3d/1645107606630/RLA+SOP.pdf">Standard Operating Procedures for Risk Limiting Audits</a>: A risk-limiting audit (RLA) is a post-election tabulation audit in which a random sample of voted ballots is manually examined for evidence that the originally reported outcome of the election is correct. As <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8732" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LAIVoted22-227x300.png" alt="" width="227" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LAIVoted22-227x300.png 227w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LAIVoted22.png 738w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" />its name suggests, an RLA limits the risk of certifying a contest with the wrong winner. An RLA gives statistical evidence that the machine-tabulated results are consistent with what a full hand count of ballots would reveal. There are three main methods for conducting an RLA. Where and how ballots are scanned will be factored into the decision of which method(s) will work best. — The Elections Group</p>

<p><a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/telling-our-story-guide">Telling Our Story: An Elections Communication Guide</a>: Election oﬃcials have an extremely important and wonderful story to tell. They oversee and administer one of the best voting systems in the world, one that gives millions of Americans a voice in determining their future and the future of their country. The need to tell this story is more crucial now than ever before. Public confidence in U.S. elections has declined amid widespread disinformation and confusion about the process. — The Elections Group.</p>

While officials have long strengthened election security by creating resiliency plans, the evolving nature of cyber threats makes it critical that they constantly work to improve their preparedness. It is not possible to build an election system that is 100 percent secure against technology failures and cyberattacks, but effective resiliency plans nonetheless ensure that eligible voters are able to exercise their right to vote and have their votes accurately counted. This document seeks to assist officials as they revise and expand their plans to counter cybersecurity risks. — Brennan Center</p>

<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/brennan-center-letter-state-associations-election-officials-addressing">Brennan Center Letter to State Associations of Election Officials on Addressing Voting Equipment Breaches</a>: Insider threats are not a new phenomenon in election security. But the current participation of election deniers in the election process, and active recruitment of more, has sparked an increase in breaches of the physical security of election equipment. Election officials have an affirmative obligation to implement steps to prevent and detect unauthorized access to voting systems, and if a breach does occur, to take remedial action to address any harm that the breach may cause. This letter recommends steps that election officials can take to prevent unauthorized access to voting systems, respond to any breach that occurs, and maintain public confidence in future elections. — Brennan Center</p>

This collective, bipartisan effort helped avoid a constitutional crisis last year. But the effort to sabotage our elections has only intensified, which is why Congress and state and local governments must take critical steps to protect against insider threats. — Brennan Center</p>
<p><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/poll-worker-policy/">Closing Security Gaps in Poll Worker Policy</a>: Poll workers are the backbone of the democratic process, and the smooth functioning of elections relies on the hundreds of thousands of these part time workers across the country.<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-poll-workers637018267.aspx"> Poll workers</a> and other temporary election workers support all aspects of the election process, from setting up voting equipment to checking in voters to assisting in the counting of ballots. Election workers are your neighbors, your friends and family members, and they protect the security of American elections. There is mounting concern that temporary election workers recruited and trained by organizations with nefarious intent may undermine security and trust in the election process. While there is reason to be concerned, to date insider threats have been isolated, identified, and thoroughly investigated. Americans should feel confident in their elections systems for two reasons: (1) overwhelmingly, election workers are patriotic American citizens devoted to free and fair elections, and (2) most states and localities have guidelines for recruiting, training, and managing temporary election workers. Befitting their indispensable role in guaranteeing open and secure elections, temporary election worker service is guided by laws, regulations, and preparation that is determined by the states and localities where they serve. — Bipartisan Policy Center</p>

Their recent involvement in the elections process, and ongoing recruitment efforts of like-minded individuals, has led to an uptick in election interference efforts, raising concerns that insiders could be used to alter the outcome of future elections. —  Alliance for Security Democracy</p>

<p><a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/standards-of-conduct-for-election-workers">Standards of Conduct for Election Workers</a>: Standards of conduct set expectations for participant and observer behavior in normal election operations. Standards set the tone of the operating environment and create boundaries that – if crossed – identify individuals displaying unexpected or unacceptable behaviors. When early intervention of threatening or disruptive behavior becomes an expected part of the operation, it ceases being a reactive distraction. — The Elections Group</p>

<p><strong>Testing and Tabulators</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/logic-and-accuracy-testing">Logic and Accuracy Testing</a>: Election Officials have been testing voting machines since the late 19th Century, when lever machines <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-7940" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AnnArborIVoted-300x300.png" alt="" width="208" height="208" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AnnArborIVoted-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AnnArborIVoted-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AnnArborIVoted.png 382w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" />were first introduced. The first tests were purely mechanical, testing the accuracy of the equipment. When computer-based voting systems were introduced in the 1960s, simply testing the accurate functionality was no longer sufficient, so tests were added to verify the computer logic. The new practices are known as Logic and Accuracy (L&amp;A) testing. — The Elections Group</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/communications-resource-desk/logic-and-accuracy-protocols">Logic and Accuracy Protocols</a>: This public-facing handout is a helpful guide for any jurisdiction that wants to clearly communicate the purpose of logic and accuracy (L&amp;A) testing. — The Elections Group</p>

Recent efforts to limit the use of tabulators in at least<a href="https://tracker.votingrightslab.org/pending/search?number=7496485076190459"> six states</a> and<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/08/1085056986/as-misinformation-swirls-many-n-h-towns-will-vote-on-ballot-counting-machines"> countless local jurisdictions</a> have been based on the premise that hand counting ballots is the gold standard of accurate results. In reality, banning machine tabulation would undermine election integrity and sow distrust. — Bipartisan Policy Center</p>

Because the process for verification varies widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, we reference it here only briefly to indicate where in the process it should occur. We have created a separate document for verification and curing, which is available upon request. This guide was originally developed for jurisdictions that require the ballot security envelope to be sealed in order to open and extract the ballot. If that is not a requirement in your state, be sure and adjust those references in the Ballot Preparation section. — The Elections Group</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/communications-resource-desk/mail-ballot-processing-posters">Mail Ballot Processing Posters</a>: Conspicuous posters in mail ballot processing rooms or facilities are a helpful tool. They allow observers to follow the process as it happens, and coupling posters with handouts that provide descriptions of each process is an effective way to provide additional clarity. — The Elections Group</p>

A month before the anticipated midterm vote, the officials said they were closely monitoring<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-worker-threats-7-states/"> potential threats to election workers</a> in the U.S., after local officials reported a wave of harassment and abuse before and after the contentious 2020 presidential election. Since June 2021, the federal Elections Threat Task Force has reviewed more than 1,000 reports. About 11% of those met the threshold for federal investigation, so far resulting in four arrests. The bulk of the potentially criminal threats involved election workers in seven states – Arizona, Georgia, Colorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin – where the vote was close and involved post-election challenges. FBI officials said there was no evidence that election systems had been targeted by a cyber campaign aimed at disrupting operations or manipulating results. A significant compromise of such decentralized local election systems in the country would be &#8220;very difficult,&#8221; the officials said. Authorities were tracking attempted efforts by Russia, China and Iran to wage their own attempts at sowing distrust and promoting conspiracy theories aimed at disrupting the vote.</p>

Ron DeSantis (R) stressed that citizens in hard-hit counties will be able to vote. “I want to<a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/561755-with-damage-at-lee-election-offices-and-sites-gov-desantis-evaluates-accommodations/"> keep it as normal as humanly possible</a>,” DeSantis said Wednesday. “I think the more you depart, it just creates problems, but we do have precedent with Hurricane Michael.” In a<a href="https://twitter.com/Lee_Elections/status/1577313372583911424"> statement</a>, Lee County Supervisor of Elections Tommy Doyle said his office is working with local cities and the county government to assess damage and determine where temporary voting sites will be needed. “In the wake of Hurricane Ian, loss of or structural damage to our offices, early voting sites and Election Day polling locations is evident,” Doyle said. “For many voters, their regular polling location will not be available,” he continued. “We understand and will do our best to provide a safe polling location that is as convenient as possible under current conditions.” He also attempted to reassure voters that the election will be conducted under Florida law. “Election security is paramount,” Doyle said. “We want voters to be confident that we are working hard to ensure they can safely, securely and efficiently cast their ballots in the upcoming election.” Doyle is asking the governor to sign off on his plan.  He sent a letter requesting to open<a href="https://abc-7.com/news/politics/2022/10/05/__trashed-9/"> 12 county-wide voting centers</a>, explaining anyone could vote at these sites. Normally the county would have 97 sites on Election Day, but he doesn’t have enough poll workers to pull that off.</p>

In a statement Wednesday, Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway’s office said that “in the face of the erosion of such fundamental democratic pillars such as truth, voting rights and the rule of law, this week the City of Madison will shroud the drop boxes in the artwork of internationally known artist Jenny Holzer, who lifts the voice of many in hopeful messages about enduring democracy.” Work on almost all of the drop boxes had been completed as of mid-week, Deputy Mayor Katie Crawley said. Rhodes-Conway said the state Supreme Court’s decision “is one in a long line of decisions that negatively impacts voters in Wisconsin. &#8230; The ability to vote easily, safely and securely is fundamental to our democratic process. Rather than removing these secure ballot drop boxes, we wanted to transform them to share the powerful words of Sojourner Truth and to convey our community’s belief in democracy, voting rights and the prevailing power of truth.”</p>

According to the Ohio Capital Journal, though all of these mechanisms are already in place, LaRose wants to address skepticism in elections, such as those who denied the integrity of the 2020 election. “Our elections are being scrutinized like never before, and any lack of absolute confidence in the accuracy and honesty of those elections weakens the very foundation of our democracy. It’s the duty of my office to earn and maintain that trust,” LaRose said in a statement announcing the new division.</p>

With the general election coming up Nov. 8, items normally stored in the vault are being kept in other town vaults, including the vital records vault upstairs, said Town Clerk Ann Quirk. Stored items include boxes of old marked and unmarked ballots — which the state requires be retained for certain periods of time — and the 15 tabulation machines that accept ballots at the polling places. “Very crowded, very crowded,” Quirk said of the storage situation. “But we can get through, you know? We can get through this.” She said the locksmith who has been working on the vault is waiting for a part to arrive before the work can be completed. “It has something to do with the arm,” she said. “I would say it&#8217;s — I call it an arm. It&#8217;s the lever on the outside that connects to the lever on the inside.” To crack open the vault during the primary, the locksmith had to drill holes in the door to access an interior lever that is designed to free a person who gets locked inside the vault, she said.</p>

This isn’t the first time the team’s account has had to clarify that it’s for a baseball team and not any government official. Back in August it tweeted apparently trying to clear up any confusion by noting that it is, in fact, a baseball team playing in Harrisburg “which is great but also confusing for people trying to voice opinions on public matters.” “We can’t change laws, but we can sell you a ticket to a baseball game.”</p>

He was 75. Longmore was appointed as deputy clerk of Bonneville County in 1975 before becoming county clerk in 1979. He would win reelection 10 times before retiring. Those who knew Longmore described him as a compassionate man with both a love and a knack for public administration. Penny Manning, Bonneville County’s current clerk who replaced Longmore when he retired, said he had a deep understanding of election law and mentored her when she began working in the county’s election office in 2009. “He understood Idaho code better than anyone I ever met,” Manning said. Manning recalled that the first time she spoke to Longmore, she called him by the wrong name. He politely corrected her, an embarrassing but kind start to a mentorship Manning said prepared her to become county clerk years later. Bonneville County Commissioner Roger Christensen remembered meeting Longmore for the first time in 1996. They discussed the elections office, particularly in terms of technological upgrades to the process. “He was able to keep that whole operation going with old tech for a long time,” Christensen said.</p>

Ordinance 22-119 would require ballots to be counted by hand only and has passed by a vote of 6-1, with only Assembly Member Stephanie Nowers opposing. The assembly also passed a motion to have a special meeting on January 17, 2023, at 3 p.m. about elections. The legislation would amend Title 25 of the Mat-Su Borough Code. The ordinance comes after the assembly already passed a resolution directing the clerk to perform a hand recount of the upcoming Nov. 8 elections. Assemblymember Stephanie Nowers — who was in favor of the resolution — thinks the borough might be getting ahead of itself by introducing the new ordinance before the recount takes place. If passed, the new legislation would go into effect in 2023. Currently, the Mat-Su Borough leases 46 ImageCast Precinct voting machines each year, in addition to one central count system. According to the borough clerk, the current year-long lease of the machines ends June 30, 2023, and cost the borough $72,257.</p>

Gavin Newsom has signed legislation into law that will partially reform the state’s<a href="https://edsource.org/updates/newsom-signs-legislation-changing-recall-process"> recall process</a>.<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2584"> Assembly Bill 2584</a> and<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1061"> Senate Bill 1061</a> make several revisions to the Election Code, including increasing the number of signatures required to initiate a recall from 10 to a minimum of 30 in jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 registered voters, and a minimum of 50 in areas with more voters. The bills also require that information on recall petitions undergo the same review as candidates’ statements and that each page of the petition includes the estimated cost of the special election. Recall elections must also be consolidated with regular elections if the recall qualifies for the ballot within 180 days of a regular election. “It is far too easy to initiate a recall in California, wasting taxpayer dollars and distracting local elected officials from being able to serve their communities,” said Assemblyman Marc Berman, author of AB 2584. “While recalls can be an important tool to hold elected officials accountable, AB 2584 will ensure that the process to initiate a recall is rigorous enough to demonstrate that it is a serious effort, rather than weaponizing the recall process for the sole purpose of impeding government from working. In addition, this bill will make sure that voters are provided accurate and truthful information, and that we don’t waste limited public resources.”</p>

Council gave<a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/10/04/dc-council-non-citizens-mail-voting/"> initial approval to a pair of bills</a> that will reshape the city’s election system, largely by expanding how people vote and who can vote. The<a href="https://www.charlesallenward6.com/today_committee_on_the_judiciary_and_public_safety_to_advance_five_bills"> first bill</a>, which received unanimous support from lawmakers, would make voting by mail a permanent feature of D.C. elections, as well as require that at least 55 ballot drop boxes be used for every election. It also means that D.C. must use citywide vote centers for in-person voting instead of the traditional neighborhood-based precinct and that D.C. Public Schools close on primary and general election days to facilitate voting at schools. A<a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/09/27/undocumented-residents-could-vote-in-local-dc-elections-under-bill-advanced-by-council-committee/"> second bill</a> that was approved by the council would allow non-citizens — including undocumented immigrants — to vote in local elections. Both election-related bills require second and final votes next month, after which they will be sent to Mayor Muriel Bowser for her signature or veto. They carry small price tags that will have to be paid for in next year’s budget.</p>

The commission said she botched the certification of the county’s 22 ballot-counting machines and cites separate allegations that Otero harassed employees of the clerk’s office on multiple occasions. Torrance County Commission Chairman Ryan Schwebach urged Otero to resign at a special meeting of the commission. Otero attended the meeting and declined to respond, citing the advice of legal counsel. The politically conservative county continues to grapple with simmering mistrust about voting systems. Torrance County’s all-Republican board of commissioners has responded to that anger and skepticism by assigning county staff to monitor preparations for the November general election and conduct a hand recount of primary election results. County Manager Janice Barela is at the forefront of that oversight effort. She attended the certification of voting machines last week and said pre-signed certificates struck her as “dishonest” because the county clerk was not in attendance. “That goes to the core of what her duties are,” Barela said Tuesday. “That’s the very first thing, is certifying the machines. &#8230; That means something. We need to have trust.”</p>

Voting advocates, civil rights groups, and several formerly incarcerated people urged lawmakers to reject the bill, warning it would suppress voter turnout among New Jerseyans of color, especially those with criminal histories. In January, Gov. Phil Murphy signed the law barring on- and off-duty police officers from being within 100 feet of a polling station or ballot drop box absent an emergency, a bid to prevent voter intimidation. The bill included an exception allowing senior living facilities that double as polling places to request a police officer be stationed there if the facility reports a threat or other safety concern. The bill advanced Thursday would add a similar carveout for public schools, alarming opponents. Concerns over school safety and difficulties finding locations to house voting machines on Election Day have pushed lawmakers to consider tweaks. The bill to allow police at polling places in public schools was introduced in June, roughly a month after a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. The New Jersey Association of Election Officials and New Jersey School Boards Association both supported the legislation.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are looking to pass a<a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/10/05/new-jersey-lawmakers-want-a-state-voting-rights-act/"> new set of voting protections</a>. The <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/A4554">bill</a> would give the state Division on Civil Rights oversight powers over elections that impinge the ability of people belonging to a protected class — defined here as members of a race, color, or language minority group — to influence an election or elect candidates of their choice. “I just think it’s really important for folks in general,” said Assemblyman Benjie Wimberly (D-Passaic), one of the bill’s prime Assembly sponsors. “Voting should be something that is a right for all.” Dubbed the John Lewis Voting Rights Act of New Jersey — after the congressman and civil rights activist who died in July 2020 — the measure would also grant state courts broad powers to tweak election rules and dates if they find existing rules violate its provisions. In such cases, the bill would grant courts the power to redraw voting districts, increase the size of a given governing body, move elections to coincide with higher turnout primaries and general elections, and demand additional polling locations and voting hours, among other things. It would also create preclearance rules at the state level that could require localities that breach the state Voting Rights Act to get approval from the Division on Civil Rights or a state court before changing any part of their electoral process.</p>

The justices’ decision not to hear the case means a federal judge’s ruling in August 2021 that allowed the lawsuit to move forward remains in place. Lindell had unsuccessfully asked U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols of Washington, D.C., to allow him to appeal two legal questions related to the landmark 1964 Supreme Court defamation ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan, which concluded that there must be evidence of “actual malice” for a public figure to pursue a defamation claim. Lindell argues that Dominion is a public figure because it performs a government function in elections and that therefore the “actual malice” standard applies. His lawyers argue that because Lindell genuinely believes in his claims, there was no “actual malice” and that therefore the lawsuit should be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Court heard oral arguments in<em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/us/alabama-supreme-court-voting-rights-act.html"> Merrill v. Milligan</a>,</em> a redistricting case out of Alabama that could imperil further the Voting Rights Act. According to published reports, the court’s conservative majority seemed to be searching for a narrow way to uphold a congressional map drawn by Alabama lawmakers that a lower court had said diluted the power of Black voters, violating the Voting Rights Act. Based on their questioning, which was mostly subdued and limited, the court’s conservatives seemed likely to reject some of the state’s most aggressive arguments, which would impose profound new restrictions on how the 1965 act applies in redistricting cases. “If one just listened to the oral argument, one might think that these justices are up for grabs in this case,” Richard L. Hasen,s, told The New York Times. But he cautioned that questioning can be misleading and that the court may well rework the leading precedent to make it much harder to challenge voting maps. The court’s three liberal members pushed hard to curb potential damage to the law, which Justice Elena Kagan called “one of the great achievements of American democracy.”</p>

Only 712 Republican poll workers were hired as opposed to the 857 Democrats, according to the suit. The letter also claimed a “significant disparity between political parties in the central processing boards utilized at the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center during the primary.” The RNC claimed only 10 Republican poll workers were allowed on the “receiving/inspection boards” versus 58 Democrats, which they said violated the state’s procedures manual that requires each central board to be “comprised of two members of different political parties.” The RNC also claimed  Republican poll workers were subjected to a far more rigorous regimen than their Democrat counterparts.</p>

Baker has<a href="https://www.ktlo.com/2022/10/02/federal-judge-declares-6-sections-of-arkansas-election-law-unconstitutional/"> declared as unconstitutional six sections</a> of Arkansas election law pertaining to “new political parties.” G. Baker sided with the Libertarian Party of Arkansas in its lawsuit against Secretary of State John Thurston. She enjoined Thurston from enforcing six sections of state law. Among other things, the changes implemented by the sections mentioned above effectively increased the signature requirement for getting a party candidate on the statewide ballot from 10,000 to 3% of the number of people who voted in the last election for governor, which would have been 26,746 based on the 2018 election. (The 10,000 signature option was eliminated.) The statutes also moved up deadlines, shortened the amount of time allowed for candidate petition drives, and required new political parties to qualify candidates through a convention. In her 83-page opinion and order, Baker wrote, “The Court concludes that, because of the combined effect of the early petition deadline, the 90-day petitioning period, the three percent petition requirement, the requirement that new party candidates declare before the major party candidates are selected, and that new parties select their candidates at a party convention and not at a primary or runoff election, the Court grants plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.”</p>

The court said in its ruling that it agreed with Superior Court Judge Robin Wilson&#8217;s finding that city election officials failed to comply with certain statutory guidelines but found that Cohen had not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the final results were not legitimate. Following the close election between Rossi and Cohen, a recanvass of Election Day upheld that the mayor won her third term by 32 votes. Although Cohen received more votes on Election Day machines, Rossi&#8217;s margin of victory on absentee ballots narrowly put her over the top. In his initial lawsuit and subsequent appeal, Cohen raised questions about the Election Day handling of some of those absentee ballots, which he said cast doubts on their legitimacy.</p>
<p>Citing alleged absentee ballot fraud in the recount vote, Superior Court Judge Barry Stevens has<a href="https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Judge-orders-new-primary-for-state-house-seat-17486745.php"> ordered a new Democratic primary for the state House&#8217;s 127th District</a>. Stevens ruled that four voters had not signed applications for absentee ballots, as required by law, invalidating the final vote tally in the primary. “Because these four voters did not sign their applications for absentee ballots in accordance with (state law) they were not entitled to the absentee ballots they received, the ballots they cast should be rejected and not counted,” the judge wrote in a 14-page decision. In a hearing a short time later, the judge refused to immediately place a hold on his decision until it can be reviewed by the state Supreme Court.</p>

Jones’ judgment concludes the ambitious case against Georgia’s voter registration and absentee ballot practices after a trial in which voters testified about problems at the polls but few of them were unable to cast a ballot. “Although Georgia’s election system is not perfect, the challenged practices violate neither the Constitution nor the VRA (Voting Rights Act),” Jones wrote in a 288-page order. The decision followed what is believed to be the longest voting rights trial in the history of the Northern District of Georgia, lasting 21 days with testimony from over 50 witnesses, wrote Jones, a nominee of President Barack Obama. Jones ruled against Fair Fight on claims over Georgia’s “exact match” voter registration policy, absentee ballot cancellation practices and registration inaccuracies. “The court finds that the burden on voters is relatively low,” Jones wrote about the “exact match” rules. “Here, plaintiffs have not provided direct evidence of a voter who was unable to vote, experienced longer wait times, was confused about voter registration status.”</p>

In a 199-page order released Friday Moses struck down laws ending Election Day voter registration, creating tighter voter identification requirements and dramatically restricting third-party ballot collection. The three laws were among four originally challenged more than a year ago by nearly a dozen plaintiffs in three separate lawsuits. The three cases were eventually consolidated, and the groups challenging the laws faced off against the sole defendant, Republican Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen, in a nine-day trial in August. They were passed by a Republican-majority Legislature along nearly party-line votes. Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen along with many Republican lawmakers, have said Montana&#8217;s Constitution specifically gives the Legislature authority to determine how to hold elections in the state. Montana didn&#8217;t allow registration on Election Day until 2006, and they argued it&#8217;s up to lawmakers if they want to revert back to the previous system. Moses wrote, however, &#8220;that does not mean the Legislature has power to take away (Election Day registration) without that power being subject to judicial review and interpreted in conjunction with the fundamental rights guaranteed to Montanans in the Constitution.&#8221;</p>

Wilson ruled against the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada’s motion asking to prohibit the Nevada secretary of state’s office from authorizing counties to engage in hand counting. Nye County has decided to implement hand counting in its elections, and in response the Nevada secretary of state adopted regulations on Aug. 26 for how counties should conduct hand counting. The Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada challenged the move on Aug. 31 and filed a motion for preliminary injunction Sept. 1, arguing that Nevada’s laws preclude hand counting ballots, and that hand counting could disenfranchise voters. Wilson ruled that Nevada’s law does not prohibit the use of hand counting. Voting is permitted by a “mechanical voting system,” but it is optional, he wrote in his order. Wilson also wrote that the right to a uniform, statewide standard for counting votes does not require counties and cities to use only one method of counting votes, but rather it is a statewide standard for what qualifies as a vote. “Having some cities or counties use hand counting and others use mechanical voting systems does not violate voters’ right to a uniform, statewide standard for counting votes,” Wilson wrote.</p>
<p>The ACLU’s Nevada chapter filed a lawsuit against Nye County and its interim clerk to<a href="https://www.whec.com/politics-news/aclu-sues-over-nevada-countys-hand-counting-ballot-plan-2/"> stop the implementation of the county’s new hand-counting process</a>, which was spurred by false claims of election fraud. The process entails hand-counting all paper ballots alongside a machine tabulator. The lawsuit cites three main violations of the Nevada constitution, state or federal law in its claims. The county plans to start hand-counting its mail-in ballots two weeks before Election Day, a process that the ACLU said risks public release of early voting results. The verbal announcement of each ballot’s results from hand-count teams will result in the release of election results and information, which the ACLU alleges violates state statute. The group also says Nevada statute criminalizes the release of early voting information, potentially putting the hand-count tally team members at risk of a misdemeanor. The hand-count plan also uses “stringent signature verification,” which allows the clerk to require an ID card if a voter’s signature fails, which the ACLU said violates state statute. Normally, county clerks are required to contact the voter to ask them to confirm whether the signature used for the mail ballot belongs to the voter. Nye County’s in-person paper ballots mirror mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation filed a lawsuit on Sept. 16 against Elko County, Nev., and several county officials alleging<a href="https://www.kunr.org/politics-and-policy/2022-10-05/nevada-tribes-sue-elko-county-officials-unequal-voting-access-2022-election"> “grossly unequal voting opportunities” for the 2022 election</a>. The suit claims Elko County is giving tribal members on the reservation an early voting window of just eight hours and no opportunities to register or vote in person on Election Day. Meanwhile, residents of the city of Elko and nearby towns have 108 hours during which they can vote early and 12 more on Election Day. Native American advocacy group Four Directions Native Vote is assisting the tribes with the lawsuit. Bret Healy, a consultant with the group, noted that Nevada’s constitution requires equal rights for all voters after the passage of<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6643/Overview"> Assembly Bill 345</a> in 2019. “Simply put, Elko County is trying to have a rigged election,” Healy said. Healy said the county is providing one polling location on the Duck Valley Indian Reservation that will be open for four hours on two Fridays prior to the election. If a tribal member wants to vote outside of their allotted 8 hours, they’d have to travel roughly 200 miles round trip to the city of Elko. “That’s a $150 excursion,” said Healy, citing Internal Revenue Service mileage rates. “And if you don’t have reliable transportation, and if you don’t have lots of extra money, that’s an obstacle.”</p>

The lawsuit, if successful in court, could have a dramatic effect on the November election. Along with challenging a 2022 law that expedites absentee ballot canvassing, the lawsuit seeks to throw out another recent law allowing people to vote absentee if they fear contracting a disease like COVID-19. That could have the effect of invalidating large numbers of absentee ballots that have already been requested and, in some cases, mailed back. The complaint was filed in state Supreme Court in Saratoga County on behalf of more than half a dozen plaintiffs including Nick Langworthy, chair of the state Republican Party and a congressional candidate for the 23rd District; Gerard Kassar, chair of the State Conservative Party; and two Republican elections commissioners. They are suing the state Board of Elections, Gov. Kathy Hochul, and the leaders of the state Legislature. The Republican-led plaintiffs are asking the court to declare unconstitutional a new law adopted last year to expedite absentee ballot canvassing, a process conducted by teams of bipartisan elections officials to determine if an absentee ballot envelope appears valid, invalid, or contains any curable defect, such as a missing voter signature. They also want the court to rule that the threat of COVID-19 is not a valid excuse to seek an absentee ballot.</p>

The board’s Democratic majority in July had rejected an initial signature matching proposal introduced by Republicans, citing concerns that it could create unequal voting access and allow partisan bias to contaminate the electoral process.</p>

The decision was a loss, at least temporarily, for Republicans who have tried in recent years to stop local elections officials from offering voters the opportunity to fix errors like missing signatures that would otherwise cause their ballots to be thrown out. “Petitioners have not proven that there is a clear violation of the Election Code or the law interpreting the Election Code,” Ceisler wrote in her 58-page opinion. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit brought by the Republican National Committee, which had asked the judge to bar the practice — known as “ballot curing” — before the November election. But barring all 67 counties from doing so, Ceisler wrote, “would clearly cause greater injury than refusing the injunction, precisely because it would seriously harm the public interest and orderly administration of the 2022 General Election, which is already well underway.” The RNC called Ceisler’s decision “flawed” and said it was weighing its options for appeal to the state Supreme Court.</p>

In July 2021, the State Supreme Court announced that it would not take up the commission&#8217;s Metro Charter referendum appeal. In that ruling, the Tennessee Supreme Court stated, &#8220;The Court concludes that this case does not warrant the extraordinary action of the exercise of the Court’s authority to assume jurisdiction. As a result, the motion to assume jurisdiction is DENIED.&#8221; The referendum was an effort by the group 4GoodGovernment to change the charter on a number of different topics, but primarily property taxes.</p>
<p>The Tennessee Supreme Court heard arguments in a voting rights case where plaintiffs allege<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/05/tennessee-supreme-court-hears-out-state-felon-voting-rights-case/69540601007/"> the state illegally blocked a man from registering to vote over a previous felony conviction</a> in Virginia, even though his voting rights had been restored there. Ernest Falls, who was granted clemency and had his voting rights restored for a prior conviction in Virginia, moved to Tennessee and tried to register to vote in Grainger County in 2020. Tennessee officials said Falls failed to prove he had paid all court costs and restitution required by the state of his conviction, a requirement the state puts on people seeking voter restoration following a Tennessee felony conviction. But Falls never owed court costs or restitution in his Virginia case, and the clemency grant fully restored his right to vote in Virginia. &#8220;A fundamental bedrock interest in this case is that a person who has the fundamental right to vote does not need his rights restored,&#8221; Falls&#8217; attorney Bill Harbison argued before the Tennessee Supreme Court. Assistant Attorney General Alex Rieger on Wednesday argued court precedent allows Tennessee to enact certain requirements, such as proving any court costs have been fulfilled in another state, on anyone convicted of certain felonies, even if they&#8217;ve had their rights fully restored in another state.</p>

The appellate court reversed a lower court’s ruling in August in which a district judge had found Texas was violating federal law by refusing to release the list. The appellate court found that the five civil rights groups suing the Texas secretary of state for the list did not have standing to sue. Circuit Judge Edith H. Jones wrote in the ruling that the groups have neither established injury to themselves from the state’s refusal to release the list nor sued on behalf of any voter included on the list who could be harmed. The coalition “offered no meaningful evidence regarding any downstream consequences from an alleged injury in law under the NVRA [National Voter Registration Act],” Jones wrote. “The lack of concrete harm here is reinforced because not a single Plaintiff is a Texas voter, much less a voter wrongfully identified as ineligible.”</p>
<p>The Texas Civil Rights Project filed a lawsuit seeking to keep Bexar County elections officials from<a href="https://sanantonioreport.org/bexar-county-election-locations-voting-rights-lawsuit/"> closing roughly 40 Election Day polling locations</a>. The move comes after activists and Democrats on the Commissioners Court requested Elections Administrator Jacque Callanen to maintain the number of locations to accommodate what they anticipate will be a high turnout election.  Commissioners approved Callanen’s initial list of 259, but asked her to come back with additional locations to get to 302, and added money into the county’s budget to fund them.  Callanen, meanwhile, says her office wouldn’t have the manpower to staff all of the locations. She contends they need to eliminate sites that see the least traffic.</p>

The lawsuit, filed against the Wisconsin Elections Commission in Dane County Circuit Court by liberal law firm Law Forward, follows a<a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/new-lawsuit-says-wisconsin-clerks-should-accept-ballots-with-partial-witness-addresses/article_d49efe56-600b-51e6-9e07-d1ecb4d52fbd.html"> similar lawsuit</a> filed arguing that absentee ballots with partial witness addresses should be accepted as long as clerks can discern the correct addresses. Both lawsuits follow a Waukesha County judge’s ruling in early September that election officials can’t fix or fill in missing address information on absentee ballot envelopes — a ruling that “threatens to unlawfully disenfranchise Wisconsin voters,” the latest lawsuit states. Circuit Court Judge Michael J. Aprahamian ruled against guidance issued in 2016 by the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission that had allowed clerks to fix errors on witness certificates. The ruling has led to confusion among election officials, with no consensus on whether, for example, they can count a ballot if the witness certificate is missing a ZIP code. State law does not specify what constitutes an address. “While WEC’s cure guidance remained in effect, clerks were empowered to resolve address omissions or defects to avoid ballot rejection,” the lawsuit states. “So, whether a witness address was ‘missing’ was a purely academic question. No longer. That question now holds the fate of numerous Wisconsin voters.” The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin seeks a declaratory judgment defining that a missing address entails when the address field is left entirely blank. The organization also seeks to allow clerks to accept absentee ballots if the witness has included his or her street number, street address and municipality. “Wisconsin voters need an answer to the unresolved legal question of whether a witness’ address is ‘missing,’” the lawsuit continues.</p>
<p>With just over one month until the Nov. 8 general election, a Waukesha County judge on upheld his initial ruling that election officials<a href="https://madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/judge-upholds-ruling-barring-clerks-from-fixing-errors-on-absentee-ballots-in-wisconsin/article_e5f8db6a-56fd-50ed-92fa-23cfc51f3c84.html"> cannot fix errors on absentee ballot witness certificates</a>. In a final judgment, Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Michael J. Aprahamian prohibited the Wisconsin Elections Commission from “advising, guiding, instructing, publishing, or otherwise communicating information to Wisconsin municipal clerks and local elections officials that clerks or local election officials have the duty or ability to modify or add information to incomplete absentee ballot certifications.” The ruling has led to confusion among election officials, with no consensus on whether, for example, they can count a ballot if the witness certificate is missing a ZIP code. State law does not specify what constitutes an address. Aprahamian’s order also permanently prohibits the bipartisan elections commission from displaying or disseminating guidance stipulating that clerks can add missing information to absentee ballot witness certificates. Under the order, clerks can only return an incomplete ballot to the voter, who has the opportunity to correct the error or fill in the missing address information.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.eac.gov/events/2022/10/06/path-end-end-e2e-protocols-voting-systems">The Path to End-to-End (E2E) Protocols for Voting Systems</a>:  The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), in collaboration with NIST, is initiating a process to publicly solicit, evaluate, and approve protocols used in end-to-end (E2E) cryptographically verifiable voting systems for conformance to the recently revised Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, Version 2.0. This workshop will be used to discuss the plan and further develop the protocol requirements and evaluation criteria. This workshop will cover the following: A keynote presentation on E2E in voting systems; Four discussion-based panels covering: Integrity and Voter Confidence, Voting System Security, Accessibility and Human Factor Considerations, Implementation of E2E in Voting Systems/Testings; Next Steps; Q&amp;A Session <strong>When:</strong> October 6 &amp; 7, 1pm-5pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/npc-headliners-book-event-major-garrett-and-david-becker-big-truth">NPC Headliners Book Event: Major Garrett and David Becker, &#8220;The Big Truth&#8221;</a>: Less than a month before the midterm elections, CBS Chief Washington Correspondent Major Garrett and David Becker, one of the nation&#8217;s leading elections experts, will discuss their new book, &#8220;The Big Truth: Upholding Democracy in the Age of THE BIG LIE,&#8221; at a National Press Club headliners book event. Garrett and Becker&#8217;s new book examines the potentially dire consequences for the 2022 midterms and beyond. Filled with interviews with key players — election workers, January 6th Committee members Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md), Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and more — they take a close look at what is known as the Big Lie. Garrett, a veteran Washington correspondent, and Becker, the Executive Director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Integrity, make a case that Big Lie “fraud” allegations evaporate under scrutiny. The authors examine what actually happened in 2020, while reporting on what they call each Trumpian misdirection designed to con and beguile Americans into chasing phantom allegations of election crimes. The authors argue that the next midterm and presidential elections will test American democracy more severely than at any time since the Civil War, arguing that how Americans react may determine whether the country is led into another war against itself. The program will include a question-and-answer session with Garrett and Becker. <strong>When:</strong> October 11. <strong>Where:</strong> National Press Club, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newamerica.org/international-security/events/information-security-minority-communities-and-2022-election/">Information Security, Minority Communities, and 2022 Election</a>: November’s upcoming midterm elections are the first federally administered elections since 2020, which were notable for the numerous attempts to cast doubt on the legitimacy and security of the presidential election. The presidential election also highlighted the role of information security and operations in election, and how mis/dis/malinformation interacts with the US democratic process. As the US heads into election season, why should election security expand to include information security, and how does this impact minority communities within the US? New America’s #ShareTheMicInCyber Fellowship program is pleased to invite the public for a virtual panel discussion on the role of information security and operations in election security. There will be a moderated panel discussion, followed by an audience Q&amp;A session. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> October 12, 10am Eastern.</p>
<p><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/event/to-save-democracy-make-it-worth-saving/">To Save Democracy, Make It Worth Saving: Get More Done</a>: Former Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Alice Rivlin’s posthumous book, Divided We Fall contains an urgent message to the American public: Get involved in making democracy work better or risk losing it. Alarmed at the state of American politics and policy, Ms. Rivlin combined scholarship with personal experience to call on political leaders of both parties to break stalemates and make the compromises necessary to reach bipartisan agreements. Following her passing in 2019, Ms. Rivlin’s son and daughter-in-law, Allan and Sheri Rivlin, completed her manuscript. Join BPC for a discussion on the state of politics and public policy, as well as the legacy of the late Alice Rivlin. <strong>Where:</strong> Online &amp; in Washington, DC. <strong>When:</strong> October 12, 5pm Eastern.</p>

Are you prepared to be a watchdog for disabled voters in your communities? What is your newsroom doing to ensure your election coverage is useful and accessible for disabled voters?

<p><a href="https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/event/its-time-audit-every-state-every-election">It’s Time to Audit: Every State, Every Election</a>: Presented by The Heritage Foundation: While in-depth financial and accounting audits are a standard practice in the business world, they are almost nonexistent in public elections. Should all states require comprehensive audits of their voter registration, voting, and vote tabulation processes and systems? How should such audits be conducted and who should conduct them? What should auditors be reviewing and what standards should they apply to election administration? How often should audits be conducted and how many political subdivisions within a state should be audited? On the eve of the upcoming midterm elections, this timely issue is vital to ensuring the honesty and integrity of elections. Join us for a discussion of this important topic with current and former election officials. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> October 20, 12pm Eastern</p>
<p><a href="https://voteearlyday.org/">Vote Early Day</a>: Vote Early Day is a nonpartisan movement of media companies, businesses, nonprofits, election administrators, and creatives working to ensure all Americans have the tools to vote early. This holiday is a tentpole moment for partners of all stripes to engage with voters and urge them to cast their ballots. Created in 2020, Vote Early Day has brought thousands of national and local partners together in celebration and activation to increase the number of people voting early. This collaborative, open-source model—similar to Giving Tuesday and National Voter Registration Day—ensures that millions more Americans take advantage of their options to vote early through on the ground activations, get-out-the-vote pushes, national communications on traditional and social media, and efforts to create a new culture around voting. Vote Early Day plays a unique role in the push to get voters to cast their ballot. We are a trusted, nonpartisan holiday with supporters on both sides of the aisle. We provide a central moment for a wide range of partners (many non- traditional to the civic space) to engage with voters and urge them to vote early. Our collaboration of thousands of diverse partners allows us to engage in places beyond where voters are used to seeing election messages. This allows us to break through the noise and meet voters where they are. <strong>When:</strong> October 28</p>
