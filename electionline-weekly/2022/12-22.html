							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Exit Interviews<br />
</strong><em>The end of 2022 brings the end of numerous careers in elections</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Seven presidential elections, an election on September 11, 2001, recounts, violent threats, changing technology, changing laws, Congressional testimony, and litigation, so much litigation. Oh, and a global pandemic.</p>
<p>The elections officials featured this week have pretty much seen it all. And whether it’s due to term limits or retirement, they are all bidding the elections world adieu as 2022 draws to a close.</p>
<p>These departures are of course in addition to the<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/politics/election-workers-officials-harassment-kentucky-texas/index.html"> hundreds of local elections</a> who have left or are planning to soon leave the field.</p>
<p>We reached out to all the outgoing secretaries of state as well as a few other elections folks and these are the interviews of the people we heard from. If we get more responses in the coming days we’ll post those in a future electionline.</p>

Paul Bettencourt, a Houston Republican who helped author the law that instituted the new rule. &#8220;I expect that even 2.7 will continue to go down as everyone understands exactly how the system works.&#8221; Senate Bill 1 — passed by Texas Republicans in 2021 in the name of election integrity — requires voters to include a state ID number, such as a driver’s license or partial Social Security number when applying for a mail-in ballot and when submitting it. The ID number on the ballot has to match what is on the voter’s registration record, a detail many voters did not recall. Remi Garza, the elections administrator for Cameron County and president of the Texas Association of Elections Administrators, said he was pleased to see the decrease statewide (his county&#8217;s rate was 1.34 percent). But at the same time, he said he still sees room for improvement. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a great indication of the hard work that election offices across the state are doing,&#8221; Garza said. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad the information that has been distributed by everyone has had an impact on bringing the rejection rate down, but obviously it&#8217;s still way too high. We need to work harder to communicate with the vote-by-mail applicants on how to assure their vote is going to be counted.&#8221;</p>

During the August special U.S. House and primary elections, the Department of Justice sent federal observers to some predominantly Alaska Native polling stations to assess language accommodations for Yup’ik speakers. Reports identified what appeared to be violations of the law at some polling locations that are required to provide language assistance. The Justice Department again deployed federal observers during the Nov. 8 general election to six jurisdictions where accommodations for Yup’ik speakers are required. Reports showed lingering problems, including poll workers who did not receive mandatory language assistance training and a lack of translated election materials. Tiffany Montemayor, a spokeswoman for the division, said the division is reviewing the federal observer reports and “makes every effort to comply” with the Voting Rights Act and a 2015 court order, but noted that the agency has encountered challenges recruiting bilingual poll workers. “It is frequently difficult to recruit bilingual workers, particularly in places where the residents have informed the division that they do not need language assistance. But the division is committed to providing language assistance and it believes it has complied with the stipulated order and will continue to comply with the Voting Rights Act going forward,” Montemayor said in a statement.</p>

Mark Gordon and Louisiana Secretary of State Kyla Ardoin have banned TikTok from state electronic devices. Shortly before Gordon made his announcement, Secretary of State-elect Chuck Gray announced his own plan to ban TikTok on all state-owned government devices within the Secretary of State’s Office upon being sworn in next month. In<a href="https://lailluminator.com/briefs/louisiana-secretary-of-state-bans-tiktok-from-department-devices/"> Louisiana</a>, the ban affects only 11 cellphones, Secretary of State spokesman John Tobler said, but Ardoin has also blocked the app from the department’s WiFi networks and computers. “As Secretary of State, I have the serious responsibility of protecting voters’ personally identifiable information, which is why I have taken the step of banning the use of TikTok on all devices owned or leased by my agency,” Ardoin wrote in a letter to Edwards. “I wholeheartedly believe that doing so on a statewide level would protect our data and reaffirm our commitment to privacy protections for our constituents. Therefore, I urge you to issue a directive banning the use of TikTok on our state government’s devices with immediate effect.”</p>

The nonprofit said the award was presented for “substantial efforts’ in helping a voter with special needs cast their ballot in November. The group specifically highlighted the work of staffers Roxana Castro, Imelda Carrillo and Justin Berardino in aiding a voter. “Our staff is committed to ensuring that all voters in Orange County have equal access to the election process,” Registrar Bob Page said. “We are honored to have been presented with this award.” According to the Orange County Register, one individual thought she had successfully updated her voter registration online, but did not realize until the evening before Election Day that she had skipped a step. The person did not have the necessary technology at home to properly complete her voter registration, and her disability prevented her from leaving her house without assistance, which she lacked at the time. Elections officials partnered with Disability Rights California to send someone to the person’s home and, with real-time phone assistance, helped her complete her voter registration and submit her ballot — on Election Day. “Without the commitment, flexibility and creative thinking of these officials in the Orange County elections office, this voter would not have been able to vote in her new county of residence,” Disability Rights California said in announcing the award.</p>

At this time, mobile voting is not ripe to move forward as additional security protections are likely needed to be considered in the event we do adopt a mobile voting option in the future,” she wrote in an email. Pinto introduced the mobile voting bill in February, building off a campaign Bradley Tusk launched last year to push mobile voting in jurisdictions across the country — starting with the District. Tusk and Pinto said that mobile voting would increase turnout and democratic engagement by making it easier for residents to vote, especially Black and Latino voters for whom turnout rates tend to lag behind white voters in the city. The bill quickly raised alarms among many cybersecurity experts, who said there are too many remaining risks to pursue mobile voting at scale at this point.</p>

The move adds one year to the council members’ current terms and impacts the city library and Dial-a-Ride property taxes. Moving the council elections from odd-numbered years to even-numbered years allows the city to piggyback on state and federal elections held in even-numbered years and save money.  City Clerk Anna Soik said in her report to the council that the last city election in November 2021 cost the city $10,751. That amount could increase because of the increased costs of supplies and labor because of the growing popularity of no-reason absentee voting, Soik said. She said that, when the early voting process approved by voters in November gets up and running, that could also cause more cost.</p>

Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston would allow those convicted of felonies who are not currently incarcerated for those offenses to vote without needing to have completed parole, supervision or probation. HB 944, filed by Rep. Harold Dutton Jr., D-Houston would mandate that a county with a population of 3.3 million or more serve as a polling place, in effect creating a polling place at the Harris County jail.</p>

The new election system will be in place for the primary elections for local county board seats in June. It will not yet apply to any other election contests, though county officials have also considered plans for potentially implementing it again in next year’s general election in November. The Board approved the measure unanimously, following<a href="http://arlington.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&amp;clip_id=4153"> a public hearing</a> in November where members indicated that they would endorse the plan. “Ranked Choice Voting has been shown to make the electoral process more representative and participatory in communities across the county, as well as resulting in candidates who build consensus and a more diverse slate of elected officials,” said Board Chair Katie Cristol, who has led the county’s consideration of the elections method, in November. “I’m glad that Arlington voters have a chance to utilize this program next year.”</p>

Julian said she may order Finchem and his attorneys to pay the legal fees for Fontes and Secretary of State Katie Hobbs who had also been sued. In a 13-page order, Julian said the Republican contender failed to present any evidence that showed the outcome of the race — and his loss by more than 120,000 votes — was in any way affected by misconduct or fraud by anyone. “Honest mistakes or mere omissions on the part of election officials, or irregularities in director matters, even though gross, if not fraudulent, will not void an election, unless they affect the result, or at least render it uncertain,” Julian said. “A valid election contest may not rely upon public rumor or upon evidence about which a mere theory, suspicion, or conjecture may be maintained.” And here, the judge said, there is not even the evidence of mistakes. “Mr. Finchem does not allege that any of the votes cast were actually illegal,” she said. Nor, said Julian, did he present evidence that ballots were cast by people ineligible to vote. “What Mr. Finchem argues is a case of missing votes,” the judge said. That includes claims that people were disenfranchised because they were frustrated due to the malfunction of tallying machines at some Maricopa County vote centers and delays and left without voting, leading to “suspicions that some votes may not have been counted.” And that, said the judge, is insufficient to void an election.</p>
<p>At hearing this week, lawyers for losing attorney general candidate Abe Hamadeh, who lost by 511 votes, argue that<a href="https://www.paysonroundup.com/election_2022/lawyers-claim-use-of-wrong-pens-could-have-thrown-attorney-general-race/article_a3cfa40b-2ddd-5b37-9de2-4dd39a650c02.html"> what type of ink a voter used</a> may be at heart of why there were about 50,000 undervotes in the race. We&#8217;re not saying the machine cannot read blue ink,&#8221; attorney Tim La Sota told Mohave County Superior Court Judge Lee Jantzen. &#8220;We&#8217;re saying it is less able to read blue ink,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;And in a race of this small of a margin, that could make the difference.&#8221; La Sota said allowing him to examine ballots from Maricopa, Pima and Navajo counties where there was no choice recorded in the race for attorney general will enable him to show if these people actually wanted to vote in that race &#8212; and, more to the point, vote for the Republican contender and help him make up the deficit of 511 votes that he would need to defeat Mayes. But Emily Craiger, representing Maricopa County, said there are a couple of problems with the theory. She said it starts with the fact that the instructions given to voters specifically tell them what kinds of ink they can use that the tabulators can read. Beyond that, Craiger said the explanation that the use of certain inks or pens affected only the race between Hamadeh and Mayes makes no sense. Mohave County Superior Court Judge Lee Jantzen<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1834013/judge-allows-election-lawsuit-losing-ag-candidate-abe-hamadeh-move-forward"> ruled this week</a> that Hamadeh is entitled to try to prove that some people legally entitled to vote did not get to cast a ballot on Election Day because of issues in Maricopa County. That has to do with whether people who left one voting center because of printer and tabulator problems were illegally denied the right to vote when they arrived at a second one. Jantzen also said Hamadeh can pursue allegations that some ballots which could not be read by tabulators were improperly duplicated by election officials who are required to prepare a new — and readable — ballot. Hamadeh requested an<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/12/22/abe-hamadeh-asks-court-for-emergency-hearing-in-arizona-attorney-general-election-challenge/69749237007/"> emergency hearing</a> in Mohave Superior Court on Wednesday after failing to reach agreement on a ballot inspection in three counties. That ballot inspection was supposed to happen Dec. 21. Former Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett, a Republican, sent a declaration joining Hamadeh’s side. The hearing is set to take place at press time. The ballot inspection is provided for under election contest statutes and the trial for Hamadeh&#8217;s challenge<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/12/20/hamadeh-arizona-attorney-general-election-challenge-to-go-to-trial/69745246007/"> begins Dec. 23.</a></p>
<p>Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/12/19/kari-lake-master-plot-claim-election-lawsuit-evidence/69740001007/"> declined to dismiss</a> Kari Lake&#8217;s election challenge after oral arguments by attorneys, giving her a chance to try to prove her claims of misconduct by election officials. Thompson did toss eight of the claims in Lake&#8217;s lawsuit, but allowed two to remain that alleged an intentional plot by officials to manipulate the election in favor of Lake&#8217;s Democratic opponent, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. In two separate orders, he ruled that a<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/12/22/no-evidence-of-misconduct-in-1st-day-of-kari-lake-election-challenge-trial/69745880007/"> two-day trial will begin Dec. 21</a>, and that Hobbs and County Recorder Stephen Richer would be required to testify as Lake wished. Lake has &#8220;alleged intentional misconduct sufficient to affect the outcome of the election and thus has stated an issue of fact that requires going beyond the pleadings,&#8221; the ruling stated. It continued that Lake must show at trial that the county&#8217;s printer malfunctions were intentionally rigged to affect the election results, and that the actions &#8220;did actually affect the outcome.&#8221; Thompson didn&#8217;t immediately set the time for the trial, but ordered the attorneys for Lake and defendants including Hobbs and county officials to submit a list with the anticipated time required for the proceedings no later than 12 p.m., Dec. 20.</p>

The commission had expressed an intention to settle the case earlier, pending final details. There’s no admission of liability. The suit will pend for 90 days to insure the agreement is enforced. The only monetary payment is an agreement to use the county’s insurance carrier to pay $402.60 in court costs. No attorney fees or monetary damages were sought.</p>
<p>A group called Arkansas Voter Integrity Inc., led by Conrad Reynolds, who lost a Republican primary race against U.S. Rep. French Hill, has filed a lawsuit<a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2022/12/20/failed-republican-candidate-sues-over-arkansas-election-machinery"> challenging the legality</a> of Arkansas voting machinery. The Pulaski Circuit Court lawsuit names Secretary of State John Thurston, the state Board of Election Commissioners and Election Systems and Software, which provides voting machinery in all 75 counties. The suit contends the machinery violates state and federal law that requires that voters be allowed to verify their ballots before they are counted. The group’s suit seeks an injunction to bar use of ESS machinery — voting machines that produce a ballot and the electronic tabulators — in future elections.</p>

This past summer, the Delaware General Assembly passed a law allowing universal mail-in voting and same-day voter registration. The Public Interest Legal Foundation then filed a lawsuit against the law, alleging that it violated Delaware’s Constitution. In the opinion, the Court states that Article V, Section 4A of the Delaware Constitution only allows for absentee voting in certain enumerated circumstances. In addition, the Court writes that the state constitution establishes a deadline for voter registration.

In a complaint filed in federal court, the coalition argues the “at-large” election system is unconstitutional and a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The lawsuit was filed by the UCLA Voting Rights Project, American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, the national ACLU, and New York City-based law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton. The city uses an at-large election system, in which all city residents can vote for each of the five seats on the city commission. About 65% of Dodge City’s residents are Latino. But the election system, plaintiffs argue, allows the city’s white voting bloc to prevent the Latino population from electing candidates. No Latino candidate has been elected to the commission this century. The coalition says a map that divides the city into five voting districts would give the Latino population the opportunity to hold at least two seats on the commission.</p>

Olmsted County Attorney Mark Ostrem said Thursday that his office decided not to charge former Rochester election judges Margaret Sherman and Frederick Nolting with breaking election law because “proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a very high standard and the evidence would not meet that burden.” According to an Oct. 26 Rochester police incident report, former Byron City Administrator Mary Kathleen Blair-Hoeft reported two possible election law complaints to Rochester police on Oct. 24, sometime after the August primary election.  According to Ostrem, Sherman was suspected of running a report off of a voting machine and taking a copy home. She was investigated for allegedly violating Minnesota Statute 204C.06, Subd. 4a, which prohibits removing election materials, files, and registers from polling places, except as authorized by law.  Ostrem said Nolting was suspected of attempting to “break into the secure WiFi that the elections machines were connected to.” Nolting was investigated for alleged violation of Minnesota Statute 204C.41, which concerns felonious conduct by election officers who fail to “safely keep and product ballots on election day…” or are “guilty of fraud, corruption, partiality or misbehavior in conducting or aiding in the conduct of an election.”</p>

Early this week, Justice Jess Dickinson said the request was “not well taken and due to be denied” after “having heard argument and being fully advised on the premises.” Johnson is facing 26 felony counts in connection with embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars in grant money the county received to keep election workers and voters safe during the 2020 general election. The majority of the funds came to the county through the Center for Tech and Civic Life, which is funded in large part by Facebook and Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg. Hinds County received more than $1.8 million in election grant dollars from CTCL and the Schwarzenegger Institute. The Hinds County District Attorney’s Office alleges that Johnson used her position on the Election Commission to award hundreds of thousands of dollars in contracts to friends.</p>

McManaman’s ruled against Barger’s lawsuit on a technicality and on its merits. The judge said his court lacked the jurisdiction to consider the lawsuit because Barger’s original digital copy of the filing lacked the proper electronic verification of signatures required by state law. Jennifer Huxoll of the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, arguing on behalf of the state, contended that McManaman couldn’t consider Barger’s filing because of the missing digital notarization. The judge agreed, writing that the “law of Nebraska is clear that the filing of a motion and affidavit for a verified petition is a jurisdictional requirement” before weighing in on a requested writ of mandamus. The judge also sided with Secretary of State Bob Evnen’s office and Attorney General Doug Peterson’s office that state law left the decision on the recount method to the secretary. McManaman, in his ruling, found “no merit” to the argument put forward by Barger’s lawyer, David Begley, that separate sections of state law and historical practice hint at a preference toward hand recounts. “The statute simply does not say what Relator claims, but it does say that the Secretary of State shall supervise recounts,” the judge ruled.</p>

The court’s Democratic justices said they saw no reason to disturb the 2021 ruling that voided the photo ID law. The lower court said the law violated the equal protection clause of the state constitution because it was tainted by racial bias and designed to help Republicans retain their grip on the General Assembly. “We hold that the three-judge panel’s findings of fact are supported by competent evidence showing that the statute was motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose,” Associate Justice Anita Earls wrote in the majority opinion. “The provisions enacted &#8230; were formulated with an impermissible intent to discriminate against African American voters in violation of the North Carolina Constitution.”</p>

Five separate recount petitions were filed for the county&#8217;s Palmyra North, Palmyra East, North Londonderry West, South Lebanon South and North Lebanon East precincts. Each petition has three registered Republican voters alleging there was fraud or error in the vote tabulation process. Only seven of the 15 petitioners attended the hearing Thursday afternoon, with petitioners alleging fraud at Palmyra East and Palmyra North not present for the hearing.

Tylwak said that all three petitioners for each petition needed to be present to offer testimony at last week’s hearing. &#8220;There was no indication that any of these notices were returned to the prothonotary&#8217;s office, that they were undelivered or undeliverable in any way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So based on precedent, I&#8217;m convinced that everybody received notice, and that those that did not appear chose not to appear of their own accord.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marybeth Kuznik, a former Armstrong County elections director filed a federal lawsuit against the county and one of its contractors, alleging<a href="https://triblive.com/local/valley-news-dispatch/former-armstrong-county-elections-director-sues-for-discrimination-alleges-election-security-issues/"> discrimination and security concerns</a> with the county’s voting system. Kuznik was fired in 2021 shortly after she requested a new scan of ballots after the 2021 primary in Brady’s Bend, where 18 ballots initially were missing, according to her lawsuit filed Nov. 21.  It is unclear whether the issue was resolved, but the Pennsylvania Department of State certified Armstrong County’s 2020 and 2021 election results.  Kuznik’s attorney claims Kuznik was discriminated against because of her whistleblower activities alerting Armstrong County officials of potential security problems in the elections department.  Many of the lawsuit’s allegations are directed at an independent contractor, Jeffrey Jessell, who helped program and operate the county’s electronic voting system.</p>
<p>Judge Eric R. Linhardt has<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/elections/2022/12/pa-judge-overturns-open-records-decision-orders-release-of-voting-spreadsheet.html"> overturned an Office of Open Records decision</a> and ruled the clear vote cast record (CVR) from the 2020 general election in Lycoming County is public record. Linhardt found CVRs are not excepted from public access under the Election Code as they are not contents of ballot boxes or voter machines. He directed the county to provide a printed copy of the 2020 CVR but stayed his order for 30 days to give time for an appeal. He did so, he explained, because it is impossible to restore confidentiality in a document that has been declassified. The concerns of the Department of State, which intervened on behalf of the county, are neither frivolous nor contrived, he said. Linhardt ruled Heather Honey, the Lebanon County voter who filed the initial Right-to-Know request for the CVR, is not entitled to it because she is not a county resident.</p>

Ballot numbering was at the heart of the controversy that led the county to request the AG opinion. There was disagreement about whether the Texas Election Code requires the consecutive numbering of ballots and whether electronic voting systems that randomly number ballots fulfill legal requirements. Carew said that the Texas Secretary of State “worked closely with Hart Intercivic” and that she had received confirmation from that office that the automatic numbering system met legal requirements. Carew had 14 years of experience as an elections administrator and was president of the Texas Association of Elections Administrators when she was hired by the Hood County Elections Commission in a 3-2 vote in August 2020. Although there were no reported issues with the November 2020 election in which President Donald Trump received more than 80% of the vote in Hood County, 2021 brought a laser focus on Carew and on how elections are handled in the county.</p>
