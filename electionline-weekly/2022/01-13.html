														<p><strong>2021 Legislative Action on Elections</strong><br />
<em>NCSL staff take a look at some of the trends in election leg last year</em></p>
<p>By Saige Draeger and Amanda Zoch, Ph.D.<br />
<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/">National Conference of State Legislatures</a></p>
<p>On the heels of an election year unlike any other, it’s no surprise interest in elections peaked during the 2021 legislative session. An astounding 3,676 election bills were introduced last year—the highest number recorded since NCSL began tracking in 2001. Despite this groundswell of activity, the number of election enactments was consistent with other odd-numbered years (2019 being the exception) with 285 bills across 42 states and 2 territories becoming law.</p>
<p>Absentee/mail voting was a popular topic, due in large part to the historic expansion of absentee and vote-by-mail options precipitated by the pandemic in 2020. Even so, only a handful of states drastically expanded or limited absentee/mail voting, a larger chunk made changes to ballot collection rules, and addressed a feature of the process that, until 2021, wasn’t much of a legislative issue: ballot drop boxes. Lawmakers also enacted laws for the first time prohibiting private funding for election administration (a 2020 trend never seen before) and in a few states, increased oversight of election officials, including setting civil and criminal penalties for officials who break state laws.</p>
<p>We’ve summarized the year’s legislative trends below. For details on all these enactments and more, visit our<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/2021-election-enactments.aspx"> enactments page</a>. To learn more about what didn’t pass, visit NCSL’s state election legislation <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/elections-legislation-database.aspx">database</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Absentee/Mail Voting</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4166" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CaliforniaCapitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Absentee/mail voting received serious attention in 2021 from various angles. Three states—<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:CA2021000A37&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=80a190966fbdabf0fda093291c4f6072&amp;mode=current_text">California</a>,<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:NV2021000A321&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=878820bb68f0ea3b9305193a792ca716&amp;mode=current_text"> Nevada</a> and<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:VT2021000S15&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=9984fcf96d29f539f0a19e58ca95b962&amp;mode=current_text"> Vermont</a>—moved to<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-18-states-with-all-mail-elections.aspx"> all-mail elections</a>, bringing the total number of states conducting elections by mail to eight.</p>
<p>Several enactments addressed when absentee/mail ballots must be returned.<a href="https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&amp;leg_video=&amp;bn=A06047&amp;term=2021&amp;Text=Y"> New York</a> joined 34 other states requiring ballots be returned by Election Day (previously the deadline had been the day before Election Day).</p>
<p>The other 15 states and D.C. will accept ballots after Election Day, as long as they’re postmarked on or before Election Day. In 2021,<a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF%20590&amp;ga=89"> Iowa</a> and<a href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB3291/Enrolled"> Oregon</a> shifted places: Iowa removed its “postmarked by” provision and now requires ballots to be received by  Election Day, and Oregon went the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Four states—<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:IA2021000S568&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=0b1dbfd7ded815e7148406397bdc56c1&amp;mode=current_text">Iowa</a>,<a href="https://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2021/A4186B"> New York</a>, <a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:TX2021000H1382&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=37c636f11fe258bcb9bdc15b28144d3c&amp;mode=current_text">Texas</a> and<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:UT2021000H70&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=c0447541aee0e606a7f05d5fdfbe720f&amp;mode=current_text"> Utah</a>—established<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx#systems"> ballot tracking systems</a> allowing voters to follow their absentee ballot as they would a package, bringing the total number of states with such systems to 34. Three states—<a href="http://laws.flrules.org/2021/11">Florida</a>,<a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/201498"> Georgia</a> and<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/872/billtext/pdf/SB00001F.pdf#navpanes=0"> Texas</a>—added voter identification requirements to absentee ballot request applications and/or absentee ballot returns. And<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:KY2021000H574&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=6be35cbbbaff7d9383024106bfeba479&amp;mode=current_text"> Kentucky</a> and<a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/A6970"> New York</a> established <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-6-states-with-web-based-and-online-absentee-ballot-applications.aspx">online absentee ballot request portals</a>.</p>
<p>Five states also took steps to reduce absentee/mail ballot rejection rates.<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:IN2021000S398&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=bb94533c5ff02a993ee8af5ccc31b48b&amp;mode=current_text"> Indiana</a>,<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:KY2021000H574&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=6be35cbbbaff7d9383024106bfeba479&amp;mode=current_text"> Kentucky</a>,<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:TX2021020S1&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=ed4e9564903deb962c78cb6cbbb05575&amp;mode=current_text"> Texas</a>,<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:VA2020000S1245&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=913d1f9c5a9e743c89b4c3cef3749f8c&amp;mode=current_text"> Virginia</a> and<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:VT2021000S15&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=9984fcf96d29f539f0a19e58ca95b962&amp;mode=current_text"> Vermont</a>—created a<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-15-states-that-permit-voters-to-correct-signature-discrepancies.aspx"> signature curing process</a>, which allows voters to correct signatures deemed discrepant by election workers from previous signatures on a voter’s record. This brings the total number of states with a signature cure process to 23.</p>
<p><strong>Ballot Drop Boxes and Ballot Collection</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3874" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hawaii-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hawaii-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hawaii-Capitol-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Hawaii-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Until 2020, only eight states made mention of drop boxes in statute, and those statutes almost entirely addressed security features. In 2021, that changed, with nine states—<a href="http://laws.flrules.org/2021/11">Florida</a>,<a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20212022/201498"> Georgia</a>,<a href="https://capitol.hawaii.gov/session2021/bills/HB199_HD1_.PDF"> Hawaii</a>,<a href="https://ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=&amp;SessionId=110&amp;GA=102&amp;DocTypeId=HB&amp;DocNum=1871&amp;GAID=16&amp;LegID=130614&amp;SpecSess=&amp;Session="> Illinois</a>,<a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF%20590&amp;ga=89"> Iowa</a>,<a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/acts/21RS/documents/0197.pdf"> Kentucky</a>,<a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2021RS/bills/hb/hb1048E.pdf"> Maryland</a>,<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=SF0002&amp;version=latest&amp;session=ls92&amp;session_year=2021&amp;session_number=1&amp;format=pdf"> Minnesota</a> and<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0471"> Virginia</a>—enacting bills related to drop boxes. While many of those bills addressed security features, such as 24-hour cameras and lighting requirements, some created new stipulations relating to the number of drop boxes permitted or required in a given area, and where they should be located.</p>
<p>Ballot collection laws, which define who can return a ballot on behalf of a voter and how many ballots can be returned per collector were common and controversial before 2020. The issue got even hotter in 2021. Forty-three states have ballot collection laws, and three of them—<a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/iactc/89.1/CH0147.pdf">Iowa</a>,<a href="https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/acts/21RS/documents/0197.pdf"> Kentucky</a> and<a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2021/sesslaws/ch0534.pdf"> Montana</a>—enacted legislation placing further limits on ballot collection in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Voter Registration</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3756" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MontanaCapitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MontanaCapitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MontanaCapitol-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MontanaCapitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Voter registration is said to be the gateway to voting—and thus always a legislative priority. This year,<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:CA2021000A796&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=669afc17a6773a75c62489c3a1940a4c&amp;mode=current_text"> California</a> and<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/81st2021/Bills/AB/AB432_EN.pdf"> Nevada</a> updated or expanded their existing<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx"> automatic voter registration</a> programs, but the biggest news was that<a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/json/BillDetail/GenerateHtmlDocumentSessionLaw?sessionLawId=48446&amp;docTypeId=13&amp;sessionLawName=chp71"> Delaware</a> enacted automatic voter registration for the first time. Now, 21 states and D.C. automatically register citizens when they do business with state agencies like the Department of Motor Vehicles-.</p>
<p>A stone’s throw away,<a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=HP0804&amp;item=4&amp;snum=130"> Maine</a> became the 42nd state with<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-or-online-voter-registration.aspx"> online voter registration</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2021/billhtml/HB0176.htm">Montana</a> repealed its Election Day registration policy, the first state to move in that direction. Eighteen states allow voters to<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx"> register and vote on Election Day</a>. In Montana, the deadline to register is now the day before Election Day.</p>
<p>Lastly,<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0217"> Virginia</a> will permit 16-year-olds to<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/preregistration-for-young-voters.aspx"> pre-register</a> to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Voter ID</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5169" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WyomingCapitol-300x207.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="207" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WyomingCapitol-300x207.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WyomingCapitol-768x530.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WyomingCapitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />NCSL has<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/the-canvass-october-2021637668734.aspx"> written on voter ID</a> more than any other election topic due to steady legislative interest that just won’t quit.</p>
<p>In 2021, three states tightened identification requirements.<a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/HB0075"> Wyoming</a> enacted its first voter ID law (classified as<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id-chronology.aspx"> strict non-photo</a> by NCSL), bringing the total number of states with voter ID laws to 35.<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:AR2021000H1112&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=eeae130799718d2f22ec7cdc6da9a4d9&amp;mode=current_text"> Arkansas</a> eliminated the sworn affidavit as an alternative to presenting a photo ID (separately,<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:AR2021000H1244&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=0c9a43eab6105ec9dc2d63e477319542&amp;mode=current_text"> Arkansas</a> removed a photo ID religious exemption for voters with beliefs which prevent them from taking a photograph).<a href="https://leg.mt.gov/bills/2021/sesslaws/ch0254.pdf"> Montana</a> enacted legislation requiring voters without a state, military, tribal ID or passport to provide two forms of alternate ID, one of which must include a photo. This enactment also added concealed carry permits to the list of accepted single-source voter IDs.</p>
<p>States also expanded voter ID options. In<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:ND2021000H1447&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=5e8e74fe74ec7201dec4a2dc5a3b2683&amp;mode=current_text"> North Dakota</a>, students can request a document from their college or university to use as voter ID, and<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:IN2021000H1485&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=d0d9b90680bcce3ab9da410448cbeaac&amp;mode=current_text"> Indiana</a> now accepts tribal IDs.</p>
<p><strong>Early In-Person Voting</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/early-voting-in-state-elections.aspx">Early in-person voting</a> has steadily ticked up over the past two decades. According to the MIT Election Data + Science Lab, just over a quarter of all voters cast their ballots during an early in-person voting period in 2020, up from 3% in 2000. While lawmakers introduced more bills on early in-person voting in 2021 than in years prior, enactment numbers stayed relatively steady.</p>

<p><strong>Post-Election Audits</strong><br />
The term “audit” has been paired with “elections” much more this year than ever before. In NCSL parlance, we refer to statutorily mandated<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/post-election-audits635926066.aspx"> post-election tabulation audits</a>, which define procedures that can verify the accuracy of an election’s outcome .</p>
<p>Most states, use a traditional fixed percentage audit, in which a small percentage of precincts or machines are selected for a comparison of the official count to a hand tally. Over the last few years, risk-limiting audits, in which the number of ballots to be reviewed depends on how close the margin of victory was, are getting lawmakers’ attention.</p>

<p><strong>How Elections are Run</strong><br />
In 2021, in addition to legislation addressing how people vote, we saw bills and enactments on how elections are run. Here are a few that caught our eye.</p>

<p>Some novel enactments focused on<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/the-canvass-november-2021.aspx"> election officials</a>. Four states—<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:AR2021000H1803&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=1ce995c2f97984f6e16ed9b4fb8caefe&amp;mode=current_text">Arkansas</a>,<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:GA2021000S202&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=6e5ecfb994e8605313c5b77509d70a90&amp;mode=current_text"> Georgia</a>,<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:IA2021000S413&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=a8bd6f6dd1139c4506b167ddfa9cb611&amp;mode=current_text"> Iowa</a> and<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:TX2021000H574&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=2796236b7912a91ced7093c54145613a&amp;mode=current_text"> Texas</a>—created criminal penalties for election officials who don’t follow state law, each in its own way.  Mis- and dis-information was also a concern, and<a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/laws/0388.pdf"> Arizona</a>,<a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2021_22/measures/documents/hb2183_enrolled.pdf"> Kansas</a> and<a href="https://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:LA2021000H581&amp;ciq=ncsl15&amp;client_md=52a7172770e0b80e388130abc619c924&amp;mode=current_text"> Louisiana</a> passed bills making it a crime to impersonate an election official.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/poll-watcher-qualifications.aspx">Poll workers and watchers</a>—those who help run elections and those can observe them—were also a hot topic in 2021, with 13 enactments in 11 states. Some of these enactments related to new training requirements, and several others were in response to poll worker shortages and will now allow poll workers to serve in precincts where they are not registered or counties where they don’t live.</p>

							<h2>Bipartisan Policy Center Report</h2>
														<p><strong>Policy to Advance Good Faith Election Observation</strong><br />
<em>New report from the Bipartisan Policy Center</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5432" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png" alt="" width="300" height="90" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01-300x90.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BPC-Logo-01.png 638w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The United States’ democracy is built on a foundation of checks and balances. They extend from the three branches of government to the relationship between state and federal legislatures—and even to the inner workings of local election administration. Election observers and challengers are one small, but mighty, component of our intricate system of collective governance.</p>
<p>Across the globe, election observation is regarded as a pillar of democracy-building, crafted to advance transparency and integrity. When correctly managed, it stands to boost civic engagement, voter confidence, and election security. Yet without the proper guardrails in place, election observation can become a partisan or prejudicial tool used to disrupt orderly elections and undermine voter confidence.</p>
<p>Dating back to the earliest days of the republic, election observation—like much of our electoral system—has a checkered past. Throughout history, individuals have abused the right to observation to unfairly target marginalized groups. In 2020, a new crisis emerged when pandemic social distancing requirements clashed with the high number of prospective observers, all during the heat of one of the most contentious elections in U.S. history. Resource and capacity limitations left many observers feeling as if they were unfairly excluded from the observation process; other observers took advantage of their position to disrupt and delay the administration of the election. One thing became clear: Current rules around election observation are inadequate to advance the meaningful engagement of observers in the electoral process.</p>
<p>As we gear up for the 2022 midterms, many in the elections community are increasingly concerned about partisan observers and challengers disrupting the voting and counting process. If 2020 and 2021 are any indication, going forward we can expect large numbers of observers and challengers who are eager to interact (or, at worst, interfere) with the voting process. As we have seen, inadequate protections risk undermining trust in both the process and the outcome of elections. With proper policy and preparation, states will reap the benefits of an engaged electorate who is well-informed about how elections operate. If states fail to act, they risk further fracturing an already-polarized public and undermining election worker security.</p>
<p>This<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/election-observations-challenges/"> report</a> outlines policy best practices for election observers and challengers. The set of recommendations is unanimously endorsed by the Bipartisan Policy Center<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/elections-task-force/"> Task Force on Elections</a>, a diverse group of state and local election officials from across the country. Election officials have the best perspective for how election policy works when put into practice. To secure the integrity of the 2022 and 2024 elections, we need look no further than the dedicated professionals long committed to our democracy.</p>
<p>The recommendations made in this<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/election-observations-challenges/"> report</a> stand to ensure accountability and transparency in the administration of elections. For maximum effectiveness, the recommendations should be considered as a unified set. Election administration is a complex ecosystem: Changes to one policy have upstream and downstream impacts for countless other parts of the process. This set of recommendations anticipates those impacts and works cohesively to address them.</p>

In his speech, the president endorsed altering the Senate rules &#8220;whichever way they need to be changed&#8221; to bypass Republican opposition to two voting rights bills in the Senate. The president initially had resisted the rules change even as Republican-led states enacted a spate of new voting restrictions. &#8220;Let the majority prevail,&#8221; he said at the Atlanta University Center Consortium on the grounds of Clark Atlanta University and Morehouse College. &#8220;Today, I&#8217;m making it clear, to protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed, to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action on voting rights.&#8221; While experts agree that it was the president’s most forceful statement on voting rights to date, the response from both sides of the aisle was mixed. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky)<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-calls-biden-s-voting-rights-speech-profoundly-unpresidential-n1287368"> called the speech</a> “profoundly unpresidential.” Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/reactions-biden-speech-us-voting-rights-2022-01-11/"> said in a statement</a>: “While President Biden delivered a stirring speech today, it&#8217;s time for this administration to match their words with actions, and for Congress to do their job. Voting rights should not simply be a priority — it must be THE priority.&#8221; In a memo to Senate Democrats following the speech, Majority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York)<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/us/politics/democrats-voting-rights-bill.html"> laid out a new strategy</a> intended to overcome at least one procedural obstacle erected by Republicans to prevent the Senate from even considering the legislation. Under the plan, the House would package two major pieces of voting rights legislation being pushed by Democrats — the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/14/us/politics/voting-rights-bill-democrats.html"> Freedom to Vote Act</a> and the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/24/us/politics/house-democrats-voting-rights-bill.html"> John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act</a> — insert them into an unrelated bill and pass it. That measure would then go to the Senate as what is known as a “message,” meaning Republicans could not filibuster a move to bring it to the floor for debate and Democrats would not need to muster 60 votes to do so. You can read the president’s full remarks<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/01/11/remarks-by-president-biden-on-protecting-the-right-to-vote/"> here</a>.

Crawford. Smith, chairman of the Genesee County, Michigan Republican Party and a member of the Davison Community Schools Board of Education was sentenced pleading guilty to malicious use of a telephone for<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2022/01/genesee-county-gop-chairman-sentenced-to-probation-for-harassing-phone-call.html"> making a harassing phone call</a> during which his victim says he threatened to kill her dogs. The victim was Houghton County Clerk Jennifer Kelley. Kelly, who was re-elected to her position as Houghton County clerk in 2020, said she initially supported the plea arrangement but told Crawford via Zoom Tuesday that she regrets having done so because Smith has downplayed the seriousness of the phone call to her since entering his plea. “He called me to scare me. He succeeded. To live how I have for the past two years has been more than I can tell you, your honor,” Kelly said. “I have hid in my own home. I have been afraid to go outside. I have avoided functions. I have feared losing my animals &#8230; What Matt Smith has done to me &#8230; has truly changed my life.” This is one of the first successful prosecutions of someone threatening an elections official.</p>

She was 71. According to her obituary in The New York Times, Guinier made her name in the 1980s as an unorthodox thinker about whether America’s legal institutions, even after the civil rights revolution of the 1960s, needed to change further to realize true democracy. She argued, for example, that the principle of “one person, one vote” was insufficient in a system where the interests of minorities, racial or otherwise, were inevitably trampled by those of the majority, and that alternatives needed to be considered to give more weight to minority interests. During the assistant attorney general nomination process, Guinier came under fire from Republicans for her progressive views on voting rights and quotas and some scholars questioned whether her ideas about voting were in fact democratic, as she claimed. Clinton eventually bowed to pressure and withdrew her nomination in June 1993, calling some of her positions “anti-democratic.” Guinier returned to teaching and eventually moved from the University of Pennsylvania to Harvard Law School where she became the first woman of color to receive tenure. She pioneered research on implicit bias in the classroom and workplace. Later in her career she opened a wide-ranging critique of merit, especially the way it distorts institutions like her own. “The ability to see so far down the line was her gift,” Heather Gerken, the dean of Yale Law School, said in a phone interview. “She had a deep understanding of the insidious ways that power corrupts institutions, even institutions acting in good faith.”</p>

Wendy Rogers has introduced SB1133 which would<a href="https://www.azfamily.com/news/politics/arizona_politics/arizona-senator-proposing-new-bill-to-ban-mail-in-ballot-elections/article_f9bd8484-7351-11ec-b80b-13478e95cd56.html"> ban cities, towns and school boards from holding all-mail elections</a>. According to CBS5, local government entities have decided to run many of its low turn-out and off-cycle elections this way because it&#8217;s cheaper to send ballots to voters than open and staff polling stations and voting cites. Stephen Richer, the Maricopa County Recorder, said he doesn&#8217;t see a reason to change state law that gives local governments the option on how they want to run an election. &#8220;My perspective on election legislation generally is that it should identify and solve real problems, not just something we have general, vague concerns about, and I&#8217;m unaware of any such real problem,&#8221; he said Tuesday. Last year, Richer said there were three mail-in voting elections in Maricopa County with no problems. He added that there is no evidence that mail-in voting increases the risk for fraud.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7918" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SanJoseCA-300x196.png" alt="" width="300" height="196" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SanJoseCA-300x196.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SanJoseCA.png 502w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />San Jose, California</strong>: A pair of San Jose councilmembers is proposing a measure that would<a href="https://sanjosespotlight.com/san-jose-councilmembers-seek-to-extend-voting-rights-to-immigrants-undocumented-residents-noncitizens/"> allow immigrants who are not U.S. citizens to participate in local elections</a>. The measure, which requires voter approval, would give more than 200,000 noncitizen residents in San Jose a right to select new lawmakers and weigh in on different policies in future local elections. Councilmembers Magdalena Carrasco and Sylvia Arenas, who are spearheading the efforts, introduced the landmark proposal Friday—just days before the City Council is scheduled to vote on changes to the city’s charter. “This is a novel idea, but not a new idea,” Carrasco said at a news conference Monday, adding it’s unfair that the immigrant community pays taxes and contributes to the economy without having a say on local policies. “We need to make sure that the voice of our noncitizen community is not suppressed or erased… They deserve the right to vote for those in power.”</p>

The effort is aimed at preventing a repeat of moves made in 2021 by Gov. Ron DeSantis. He delayed setting special elections to fill a congressional and three state legislative seats far longer than he and other governors ever have before. The proposed change would require the governor to set special elections within 180 days of the vacancy, but also asks that they be set as soon as is feasible, “so it certainly could be much sooner than six months.” “There was no reason for this to happen. It has never happened before,” Sen. Tina Polsky said. The proposed change would “take away this discretion, the vagueness [in the law] that has allowed this to go on. I don’t want to see this happen again in the future.”</p>
<p>Sen. Travis Hutson, a Palm Coast Republican, has filed an elections package that would, among other things,<a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/484728-ranked-choice-voting-could-be-eliminated-before-the-first-ballots-get-cast-in-florida/"> eliminate ranked-choice voting</a> (RCV) in Florida. “I don’t think you should be numbering and ranking people on the ballot,” Hutson said of SB 524. “One person should win, or if there is a runoff you should go to a top two.” The bill also would also raise a cap on candidate reporting fines and allow for elections supervisors to have two more early voting sites.</p>

Pritzker<a href="https://www.myjournalcourier.com/news/article/Pritzker-signs-bill-relating-to-elections-in-2022-16763995.php"> signed an amended bill</a> that deals with the primary election in 2022, allowing voters to request vote by mail ballots beginning March 30 and ending June 23, and allowing for a signature collection period from Jan. 13 to March 14. House Bill 1953 as amended would amend the Election Code for 2022 and the Legislative Commission Reorganization Act of 1984, and also provides that in 2022 the period during which newsletters and brochures may not be mailed begins on May 15.

The bills are LD1821 “An Act To Make Interfering with an Election Official a Class C Crime”, and LD 1779 “An Act To Protect Election Integrity by Regulating Possession of Ballots and Voting Machines and Devices”. “A bill by representative Bruce White, it is a bipartisan piece of legislation to make it a crime to threaten an election worker or attempt to disrupt an election through a violent activity. The second bill is to protect the integrity of ballots and voting equipment,” said Secretary of State Sheena Bellows. At a<a href="https://www.sunjournal.com/2022/01/12/harsher-punishment-sought-for-those-who-threaten-election-workers-in-maine/"> hearing this week</a>, clerks said they have noticed higher tensions and more confrontations with angry and misinformed voters, and the situation is making it harder to find poll workers.</p>

Alderman Sharon Tyus, 1st Ward, plans to introduce two bills to try to do that, according to the tentative agenda released for the meeting. One measure would simply repeal the existing law, under which residents vote for as many nonpartisan candidates for an office in a March primary as they “approve” of — with the top two moving on to a runoff in the April general election.  City voters adopted the new system at the November 2020 election after activists got it on the ballot through an initiative petition campaign. The other Tyus bill would return to holding partisan primary and general elections, but add a runoff in situations in which no one gets at least 50% of the vote in a primary with more than two candidates. Under that proposal, the municipal primary would move to February, the new primary runoff would take place in March and an April general election would feature party nominees and any independent candidates who qualify by petition.</p>

Tom Briese has introduced legislation to<a href="https://fox42kptm.com/news/local/jan-6-inspired-bill-aims-to-improve-voter-confidence-by-making-voter-fraud-a-felony-tom-briese"> enhance penalties for voter fraud</a> in the Corn Husker state. Illegal manipulation of election results through fraud, extortion would be consider a Class II felony. Briese told Fox42 that he’s not questioning past election results, but that he’s concerned about the perception and sees the legislation as a way to address that. Briese said, “Voter fraud whether real or imagined I believe poses a serious threat to our republic and I believe we need to prevent voter fraud and increase the public&#8217;s confidence in the system.” Sen. John Cavanaugh says there&#8217;s little to no evidence of voter fraud in Nebraska and he&#8217;s concerned about efforts that address a problem that doesn&#8217;t exist. “I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the purview of the legislature to regulate people&#8217;s perceptions,” Cavanaugh said.</p>

The bill was drafted largely in response to last year’s general election, when slow vote counting in some counties caused election results in several races to remain undetermined for days or weeks after Election Day. “This year’s election results were significantly delayed due to the counting of [absentee and early] ballots,” State Sen. Troy Singleton (D-Delran), one of the bill’s sponsors, said last month when the bill was introduced. “By allowing county boards of elections to begin processing early votes and VBMs before Election Day, we hope to restore timeliness and confidence in the process, while maintaining and upholding election integrity.” Every Democrat on the committee voted in favor, while all four Republicans abstained.</p>
<p>Both chambers of the Legislature have approve a bill that would<a href="https://www.governing.com/now/new-jersey-may-ban-police-at-polling-station-ballot-drop-boxes"> limit police presence</a> — for plain-clothed or uniformed officers — and would also prohibit any electioneering within 100 feet of a ballot drop box.

Under the proposal: Extending early voting, making Election Day a holiday, and permitting residents as young as 16 to vote in local elections. Restoring voting rights to those convicted of felonies who are not incarcerated. Creating a voluntary permanent absentee voter list of voters who would automatically receive election ballots by mail. Allowing residents without a state-issued ID to register online using their Social Security number. Mailing ballots to voters 35 days before Election Day and accepting ballots as late as 7 p.m. on the Friday after an election, to accommodate postal service delays. Extending time for indigenous nations, tribes, and pueblos to request alternate voting sites.

The bills would continue expanded absentee ballot voting that was allowed earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic, and permit voters to cite the virus as a reason to skip going to the polls. They would instead receive mail-in ballots for the spring school board elections, the June primary and November’s general election. The measures would also shrink the voter registration deadline from 25 days before an election to 10 days. They would also create more early voting locations and allow for portable polling places in some counties. There also would be more absentee ballot drop-off locations. And, New Yorkers could more easily register to vote at a second residence within the state. Two of the measures are aimed at remedying the November defeat of two ballot propositions. One would have allowed the Legislature to enact universal mail-in voting, and the other would help pave the way for same-day voter registration.</p>

Leroy Irvis Voting Rights Protection Act</a>, is named after K. Leroy Irvis, a former speaker of the Pennsylvania House who was also the first Black speaker of any state legislature since Reconstruction. The proposal would bring 15 days of early voting and same-day voter registration to Pennsylvania, while giving counties 21 days to pre-canvass mail-in ballots – a provision that counties have been asking for since mail-in voting was enacted in 2019. The bill would also implement the use of electronic poll books, allow voters to fix or “cure” ballots that are defective and require counties to provide at least two ballot collection drop boxes within their borders. HB 2090 currently awaits a vote in the House State Government Committee.</p>
<p>A bill to ensure voting<a href="https://www.heraldstandard.com/election/bill-to-prevent-election-day-ballot-shortages-earns-committee-approval/article_dc623fd0-723c-11ec-92db-7313198c34f8.html"> precincts have enough ballots to accommodate in-person voters</a> has been approved by the House State Government Committee. State Rep. Ryan Warner, R-Perryopolis, introduced the legislation after voting precincts in several areas of the state, including Fayette and Westmoreland counties, ran out of ballots in the May 2021 primary election. “It’s unconscionable that a voter would show up to cast his or her ballot only to be told there aren’t any left,” Warner said. “There is no excuse for ballot shortages in any election, and my bill will make sure this never happens again.” House Bill 1614 would require enough ballots to be printed and supplied to each precinct for 50% of all registered voters in that precinct in each party for a primary election, and 100% of all registered voters in that precinct for a general election. Each of these numbers could be reduced by the number of registered voters in an election district that have requested an absentee or mail-in ballot. The measure now goes to the full House for consideration.</p>

The bill,<a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/people/single/2022/30955"> S. 172</a>, passed by voice vote and was sent back to the Senate for delivery to Gov. Phil Scott. Quick passage was seen as essential to allow town clerks, and town and school boards, to plan for Town Meeting Day, which is March 1 this year. An amendment offered by Rep. Casey Toof, R-Franklin, that would have mandated universal balloting by mail for town meetings, was defeated on voice vote. The bill, which was sponsored by Sen. Jeanette White, D-Windham, and passed through the Senate on Wednesday, allows cities, towns and school districts to hold annual meetings by Australian ballot rather than floor meetings, and move the meeting to a potentially safer date later in the year. The bill also provides for electronic informational meetings to held in advance of Australian ballot voting. But it does not allow towns to permanently replace the floor meeting with polling place voting.</p>

The measure was sparked by reports of threats to workers across the country following the 2020 presidential election and the misinformation that stemmed from that, and continues to date. Democratic Sen. David Frockt, the bill’s sponsor, said the measure is needed to address “a grievous threat to our democratic system.” It’s the second time the Democratic-led chamber has voted on the measure, first passing it last year. The measure now heads to the House, also led by Democrats, where it died last year.</p>
<p>A bill that would<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/01/12/proposed-weapons-free-zones-in-washington-guns-legislature/"> ban guns from election-related locations</a> received a public hearing this week. Violations would be gross misdemeanors punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of $5,000. “When our ballots and elections workers are under threat, our democracy isn&#8217;t safe,&#8221; said Democratic state Rep. April Berg in testimony before the House Civil Rights and Judiciary Committee regarding her bill to ban weapons from ballot counting centers and other election-related facilities. &#8220;This legislation is about extending the same protections we offer to students, teachers and our courtrooms to the beating heart of our democracy, the very place where our election workers count ballots,&#8221; Berg said. Opponents of the proposed new restrictions pushed back forcefully in their own testimony. A common theme was that the bills would abrogate their state and federal constitutional gun rights and unfairly penalize lawful gun owners, without improving public safety.</p>

Under current law, people who have been convicted of felonies in Wisconsin are not allowed to vote until they complete their term of imprisonment, as well as any court-mandated periods of probation or parole. Under the new proposal, those people would also be barred from voting until they have completed any required community service hours and finished paying off any financial penalties imposed as part of their sentence, including fines and victim restitution. Rep. Shae Sortwell, R-Two Rivers, one of the bill’s sponsors, said the plan is not intended to create more barriers to voting in Wisconsin.  &#8220;We’re not making it more difficult to vote. We’re making sure justice is fulfilled here,&#8221; he said.  Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, another sponsor, argued it’s appropriate to restrict certain rights until all terms of an individual’s criminal sentence have been met. &#8220;I believe the restoration of one’s right to vote should be contingent on all debts to society being paid,&#8221; Stroebel said in a prepared statement. However, opponents of the plan equate it to a &#8220;poll tax&#8221; — a harmful obstacle that prevents people from exercising their constitutional right to vote.</p>

Paul Okeson, et al.,</a> 1:20-cv-01271, argues that Indiana’s law limiting mail-in voting to Hoosiers who are 65 or older violates the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age to 18. “Construing the Twenty-Sixth Amendment to merely guarantee that citizens age 18 or older shall have the right to vote also ignores the Amendment’s textual and historical context,” the plaintiffs argued in their brief in support of their motion for summary judgment. “In prohibiting both the denial and the abridgment of the right to vote, the Twenty-Sixth Amendment consciously echoes three of the Constitution’s earlier Amendments, which similarly provide that no state shall ‘den[y]’ or ‘abridge[]’ the right of citizens to vote on account of certain criteria: race, color, or previous servitude (Fifteenth); sex (Nineteenth); or ability to pay a poll tax (Twenty-Fourth).”</p>

Moses to put the brakes on new election laws that ended Election Day registration and restricted ballot-collection practices in the state. Arguing that the changes will irreparably harm the voting rights of Native Americans living in Montana, the plaintiffs are asking Moses to issue an injunction blocking the enforcement of the two laws until a ruling is made on their constitutionality. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the request for a preliminary injunction on behalf of a coalition that includes Western Native Voice, Montana Native Vote and the Blackfeet, Confederated Salish and Kootenai, Fort Belknap Indian Community and Northern Cheyenne tribes. The lawsuit was initially filed by the groups as a challenge to two election-related bills signed into law following the 2021 legislative session. Last month it was consolidated with two other cases challenging Republican-led changes to voting laws. Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen is the defendant in the case.</p>

Wilson’s ruling was issued following a roughly hour-long hearing. The ruling rejected all three claims raised against the initiative, and the judge concluded that changes to both primary and general elections did not violate the single-subject rule for ballot initiatives. “Every initiative presents voters with policy choices, some of which voters may prefer more than others,” the ruling stated. “But so long as those provisions relate to a single subject, it is for the initiative’s proponents to propose those policy changes. The law allows Nevada voters to propose to change the manner in which specified officeholders are chosen.” The ruling could be appealed to the State Supreme Court.</p>

The litigation challenges the bill based on the state’s constitution, election law and municipal home rule law that contradicts the bill that became law last week.  “Anyone reading N.Y. state election law in plain English can see that it prohibits foreign citizen voting,” City Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli (R-South Shore) said. “The public should look for themselves at section 5-102 to fully grasp how their city government willfully violates the law without regard.” Part of the election law reads that “(no) person shall be qualified to register for and vote at any election unless he is a citizen of the United States.” As of now, about 900,000 non-citizens, who are lawful permanent residents, will have the opportunity to vote in local elections starting Dec. 9 for things like borough president, mayor and City Council. Opponents have raised several concerns about the bill, including the brevity of the 30-day residency requirement and its effect on the city’s African-American community.</p>

Both justices cited in part the will of the voters who elected them in 2020 to resolve judicial questions. Lawyers for the civil rights group asked last summer that the two justices be disqualified from participating in the deliberations, citing conflicts. The attorneys pointed to Berger as the son of Republican state Senate leader Phil Berger, who is a defendant in the lawsuit that challenges in part the legality of a 2018 statewide referendum that enshrines a voter ID mandate in the North Carolina Constitution. And as a senator, Barringer voted in favor of holding the referendum on the voter ID amendment.</p>

In July 2021, ACLU Legal Director Witold Walczak formally asked for all documents related to the request of Sen. Doug Mastriano of Franklin County to review the county’s voting machines and election results by private company Wake Technology Services Inc. (Wake TSI), which was involved for a time in the Arizona election review. The review ultimately led the state to decertify the machines because the review violated state law. Fulton County originally denied the ACLU’s request, but on appeal the Office of Open Records ordered the county to comply in September. In the new lawsuit, the ACLU recognizes that the county released 691 documents but says there are materials missing from the collection. The lawsuit identifies several categories of documents that should have been released but were not. Specifically, the ACLU was looking for contracts and email communications with Wake TSI that are discussed and referenced in other records, including a contractual document signed by Wake TSI co-founder Gene Kern and Fulton County Director of Elections Patti Hess that was referenced in an email released by the county.</p>

<p>The statewide Commonwealth Court<a href="https://www.witf.org/2022/01/10/pa-court-wont-block-entire-2020-election-investigation-subpoena/"> declined to block an entire subpoena</a> to state election officials in what Republican state lawmakers call a “forensic investigation” of 2020’s presidential election, fueled by former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims that Democrats stole the election. But the court did not immediately greenlight the release of some information that Democratic state Attorney General Josh Shapiro challenged as being protected by privacy laws. In the unsigned order, the court said state officials and Democratic lawmakers did not persuade it that the subpoena issued in September by a Republican-controlled Senate committee had no legitimate legislative purpose. The subpoena had requested a 17 categories of records, much of it public, but also wanted information the state attorney general’s office said is protected by privacy laws — namely voters’ partial Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers and details about election systems that are barred from public disclosure by federal law governing critical infrastructure. The court also declined to debate whether the subpoena was issued appropriately under internal Senate rules, saying it would leave that matter to the Senate. It did not issue a hearing schedule or instructions on how it will handle the release of information potentially protected by privacy laws, including the partial Social Security and driver’s license numbers of roughly 9 million registered voters.</p>

We are thrilled to offer election officials the enhanced speed, accuracy and security these releases bring to both tabulation and reporting.” Both EVS 6200 and EVS 6060 include the new DS950 high-speed scanner and tabulator – the most advanced central count tabulator on the market today. The machine meets the nation’s increasing demand for reliable, accurate paper ballot scanning with customizable, full-speed sorting capabilities. The machine’s enhanced design and ballot control capabilities allow ballots to be read without scanning interruptions. ES&amp;S’ patented, embedded Intelligent Mark Recognition (IMR®) and Positive Target Recognition &amp; Alignment Compensation (PTRAC®) technologies reduce the number of ballots requiring time-consuming manual adjudication.</p>

Registration is currently available. Check back for more information on the agenda. <strong>When:</strong> January 20-25, 2022. <strong>Where:</strong> Indian Wells, California.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nased.org/-conferences">NASED Winter Conference</a>: The NASED Board voted unanimously to cancel its in-person conference scheduled for the end of January and hold the conference virtually at a date to be determined. In the coming days, NASED will announce the dates for the virtual winter conference, but they will not overlap with the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) conference so that anyone who wants to attend both is able to do so. This is not a decision that we made lightly and it was not an easy one to make, but ultimately, we think it is the best one for our members and other conference attendees.  We hope to see you in person in July in Madison, Wisconsin and, of course, virtually at our rescheduled event.</p>
