							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Countdown to Election Day 2022: Voting on Voting</strong><br />
<em>Voters in at least 13 states will vote on statewide and local voting ballot measures</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8343" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Voters in 36 states will decide 129 statewide ballot measures this election season.</p>
<p>In seven of those states, voters will make decisions on statewide election administration-related ballot measures including ranked choice voting, early voting, noncitizen voting.</p>
<p>There are also a handful of local elections-related measures on the ballot including consolidating election dates, special elections, ranked choice voting and an appointed city clerk.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Arizona<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Proposition_309,_Voter_Identification_Requirements_for_Mail-In_Ballots_and_In-Person_Voting_Measure_(2022)"> Proposition 309</a>, the Voter Identification Requirements for Mail-In Ballots and In-Person Voting Measure is on the ballot this year. A &#8220;yes&#8221; vote supports making multiple changes to Arizona&#8217;s voter identification and mail-in ballot policies, including requiring dates of birth and voter identification numbers for mail-in ballots and eliminating the existing two-document alternative to photo ID for in-person voting. Additional, there are three proposed restrictions to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/us/politics/ballot-measures-midterms.html"> ballot measures</a> on this year’s ballot: Proposition 128, which would allow the Legislature to amend or repeal ballot measures even after they are approved if a judge rules that provisions within them are unconstitutional; Proposition 129, which would limit citizen-initiated ballot measures to a single topic; and Proposition 132, which would require any ballot initiative that would raise taxes to pass by 60 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> If approved,<a href="https://www.ualrpublicradio.org/2022-09-22/coalition-forms-against-proposed-changes-to-arkansas-ballot-initiative-process"> Issue 2</a> would require 60% approval for all citizen-led ballot initiatives and proposed constitutional amendments to pass. Both currently require support of 50% plus one vote for approval.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-7535" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.31.56-AM-300x288.png" alt="" width="234" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.31.56-AM-300x288.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-14-at-9.31.56-AM.png 678w" sizes="(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px" />California:</strong> Under Measure U, voters in<a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2022/09/26/ballot-measures-san-clemente-could-soon-appoint-rather-than-elect-clerk-and-treasurer/"> San Clemente</a> will ask if the city clerk should be appointed. “San Clemente residents deserve impartial, exemplary service by a full-time, qualified city clerk who is neutral on all issues,” said council members Chris Duncan and Kathy Ward. The city clerk, whose responsibilities include record and agenda management; elections oversight; and compliance with various federal, state, and local laws (among other things), would be selected following a screening process if Measure U is approved by a majority of voters in November. In<a href="https://www.oaklandca.gov/news/2022/councilmembers-vote-to-send-non-citizen-voting-ballot-measure-for-ousd-school-board-elections-to-november-general-election-ballot"> Oakland</a>, voters will decide whether or not noncitizen parents, legal guardians, and legally recognized caregivers of children who are eligible to attend Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) schools, the ability to vote in OUSD Board Director elections. Voters in<a href="https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2022/08/12/ojai-california-mayor-selection-ranked-choice-voting-ballot-general-election/10276810002/"> Ojai</a> will decide whether ranked-choice voting should replace district-based voting.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> In<a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/09/20/odds-or-evens-boulder-voters-will-decide-which-years-are-best-for-city-council-elections/"> Boulder</a>, Measure 2E would would move the city’s elections for City Council and mayor to even years beginning in 2026 to coincide with state and federal races. To enable the transition, the City Council members elected in 2023 and 2025 would serve three-year terms instead of four-year terms and the mayor elected in 2023 would serve for three years instead of two years.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Connecticut_Question_1,_Allow_for_Early_Voting_Amendment_(2022)"> Question 1</a> in the Nutmeg State is the Allow for Early Voting Amendment, which would amend the state’s constitution. A &#8220;yes&#8221; vote supports amending the state constitution to authorize the state legislature to provide by law for in-person early voting before an election.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> Voters on<a href="https://www.kauai.gov/Portals/0/Boards_Commissions/Charter/Other/2022%20Charter%20Amendments_Final.pdf?ver=2022-08-25-154824-977"> Kauai</a> will decide whether or not the county charter should be amended to require that future elections for prosecuting attorney occur at the same time as the county’s regularly scheduled elections.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-8732 alignleft" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LAIVoted22-227x300.png" alt="" width="159" height="210" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LAIVoted22-227x300.png 227w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LAIVoted22.png 738w" sizes="(max-width: 159px) 100vw, 159px" />Louisiana:</strong> In December, Louisiana voters will weigh in on<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Louisiana_Amendment_1,_Citizen_Requirement_for_Voting_Measure_(December_2022)"> Amendment 1</a>, the Citizenship Requirement for Voting Measure. A &#8220;yes&#8221; vote supports amending the Louisiana Constitution to provide that &#8220;No person who is not a citizen of the United States shall be allowed to register and vote in this state.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Michigan_Proposal_2,_Voting_Policies_in_Constitution_Amendment_(2022)"> Proposal 2</a> is the Voting Policies in Constitution Amendment. A “yes” vote supports adding several election and voting-related policies to the Michigan Constitution, including some policies that exist in statute and others which would be new. As provisions of the Michigan Constitution, legislators would not be able to repeal or amend these policies without first passing a constitutional amendment, which would require voter approval. Proposal 2 would add the following policies to the state constitution: creating a nine-day early voting period; allowing for a signed affidavit or photo identification to vote; requiring that military and overseas ballots postmarked by election day are counted; providing voters with a right to request an absentee ballot; requiring the state to fund prepaid stamps and a tracking system for absentee ballots; requiring the state to fund a number of absentee ballot dro pboxes; providing that local governments can accept charitable and in-kind donations to assist with running elections as long as donations are disclosed and aren’t from foreign entities; and providing that election officials are responsible for election audits, requiring election audits to be conducted in public, and requiring election results to be certified based on votes cast. Proposal 2 would also add constitutional language saying that laws, regulations, and practices that interfere with a person’s right to vote are prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> A ballot measure in Nebraska will determine whether or not voters must provide photo ID in order to cast a ballot in future elections.  A &#8220;yes&#8221; vote supports amending the state constitution to require<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nebraska_Initiative_432,_Photo_Voter_Identification_Initiative_(2022)"> valid photo identification</a> in order to vote and authorize the state legislature to pass laws to specify the photo identification requirements.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-6476" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Douglas-County-300x300.png" alt="" width="202" height="202" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Douglas-County-300x300.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Douglas-County-1024x1021.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Douglas-County-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Douglas-County-768x766.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Douglas-County.png 1298w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" />Nevada:</strong><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nevada_Question_3,_Top-Five_Ranked_Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2022)"> Question 3</a> is the Top-Five Ranked Choice Voting Initiative. A &#8220;yes&#8221; vote supports establishing open top-five primaries and ranked-choice voting for general elections, which would apply to congressional, gubernatorial, state executive official, and state legislative elections.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Ohio_Issue_2,_Citizenship_Voting_Requirement_Amendment_(2022)"> Issue 2</a> is the Citizenship Voting Requirement Amendment. A &#8220;yes&#8221; vote supports prohibiting local governments from allowing noncitizens or those who lack the qualifications of an elector to vote in local elections.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong><a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/10/multnomah-county-ballot-measure-how-would-ranked-choice-voting-work.html"> Multnomah County</a> residents will be asked this November to consider changing the way candidates are chosen in county elections. The ballot question asks voters if “elections for county offices (should) give voters option of ranking candidates in preferred order, with instant-runoff vote-counting process determining results?” Additionally, if an amendment on<a href="https://www.portlandmercury.com/news/2022/08/11/44858325/multnomah-county-voters-will-weigh-in-on-voting-rights-jail-inspections-and-ranked-choice-voting-this-november"> noncitizens</a> is approved by voters, Multnomah County will be tasked with determining if expanding voting rights to non-citizens is possible under current law. If the county determines that the expansion of voting rights is illegal, the amendment would require the county to actively advocate for law changes on a state and federal level that would allow non-citizens to vote. The amendment is written broadly enough that the county’s pursuit of expanding voting rights could also include incarcerated people and people under 18, depending on the current county leadership’s priorities. In<a href="https://www.portland.gov/sites/default/files/2022/cc_infosheet_approvedbysos_sh22-106.pdf"> Portland</a>, Proposed Measure 26-222 would make several changes to local government including whether or not officials are elected using a ranked choice voting system.</p>

This would allow them to coincide with bigger elections — like the vote for president or governor. If the amendment passes, it will take effect in 2023 — with elections taking place for a three-year term ending in 2026, and again in 2025, with those elections having the same three-year term ending in 2028. In<a href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2022/aug/21/clark-county-voters-to-have-say-on-ranked-choice-voting/"> Clark County</a>, voters will decide whether or not use a ranked choice voting system in the 11 nonpartisan county offices.</p>

Gary Restaino, the U.S. Attorney for Arizona, said it’s not clear cut, whether it involves those hanging out at drop boxes or even outside of polling places. “It seems unlikely that taking pictures and video, on its own, is a violation of voting access laws,” he told Capitol Media Services. He said prosecutors would look at other factors.  In California,<a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/politics/2022/10/10/san-diego-registrar-of-voters-unveils-new-drop-boxes-as-ballots-go-out-to-voters"> San Diego County</a> Registrar of Voters Cynthia Paes recently unveiled new, stand-alone drop boxes. There will be 141 drop boxes placed throughout the county.  Three counties in<a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/ballot-box-arapahoe-adams-denver-counties/"> Colorado</a> have partnered to offer ballot drop boxes that are tri-branded so voters in any of the three counties—Arapahoe, Adams and Denver—can use them. “The partnership between Adams, Arapahoe, and Denver for a drop box is a boon for all our voters,” Adams County Clerk Josh Zygielbaumsaid in a statement. In<a href="https://www.govtech.com/civic/michigan-township-enhances-security-cameras-for-ballot-boxes"> Clinton Township, Michigan</a>, the town recently invested $22,00 in increased technology and security by equipping each box with four surveillance cameras, including one inside the box&#8217;s delivery door. Two of the boxes contain cameras that are solar powered, with support from federal election security money. Kim Meltzer, the township clerk, said ring cameras were formerly used on the ballot boxes, but the new cameras provide better visuals and sharper quality. Advocates in<a href="https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/berks/it-takes-the-joy-away-from-voting-new-berks-drop-box-policies-raise-concerns/article_03dd60fa-49ea-11ed-9150-cb3ceeab3493.html"> Berks County, Pennsylvania</a> are saying new drop box policies by the county are “taking the joy out of voting.” The county now requires a sheriff’s deputy to be at each drop box. Interim<a href="https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/local_news/interim-secretary-of-state-requests-ballot-drop-boxes-be-removed/article_08d28b20-49aa-11ed-9b09-a7ee91539a67.html"> Wyoming</a> Secretary of State Karl Allred has moved quickly to request the removal of absentee ballot drop boxes statewide. Three days after he was sworn into office, he sent a letter on Friday to all 23 county clerks. In the correspondence, he asked them to consider the request, if not for this election, then for 2024 and all future elections.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8879" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/HurricaneIan-300x276.png" alt="" width="300" height="276" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/HurricaneIan-300x276.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/HurricaneIan-1024x943.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/HurricaneIan-768x707.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/HurricaneIan.png 1138w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Hurricane Ian Update:</strong>  Local Florida elections officials are working to overcome hurdles and ensure safe and secure voting access just weeks from the pivotal midterm election. Officials are also hoping the state steps in to help alleviate some of their issues.  “<a href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/politics/elections/hurricane-ian-election-voting/67-109218a4-10a9-4a04-b775-773085e5d3d4">We are going to operate a secure election</a>,” Lee County Supervisor of Elections Tommy Doyle told a local television station. Even with ongoing challenges post-Ian, Lee, Manatee, Sarasota, DeSoto and Collier counties have all been able to mail out ballots to those that requested them. “All our vote-by-mail requests have been mailed out so that’s about 170,000 [ballots] have been mailed,” Doyle explained. Some people displaced by the storm may not be able to get those ballots. In that case, officials say to call their local supervisor of elections office to request a new one be sent to wherever they may be staying. In some cases, it could require them to change their address in their voter file and they will be able to walk them through that. Meantime, Doyle is encouraging more people to vote by mail or vote early, as some polling sites have been decimated. “We usually have 97 sites, right now I can only confirm about 50% of those are available and I can confirm that at least 25% are not available,” Doyle added. “One of the key asks of the governor is that we be<a href="https://www.wkrg.com/news/florida-election-officials-call-for-additional-voting-resources-for-ian-victims/"> allowed to use vote centers</a>,” said Mark Earley, president of Florida Supervisors of Elections. “People have been dispersed throughout the county and having vote centers extend into Election Day lets people go to one of these vote centers and not have to vote in their neighborhood because those places aren’t there anymore.” Extending that deadline for another week is among the<a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2022/10/12/voting-rights-groups-seek-emergency-actions-to-ensure-voting-access-in-ian-zone/"> actions recommended by the a cohort of voting rights groups</a>, which include the Florida State Conference of the NAACP, All Voting is Local Florida, Common Cause Florida, Equal Ground, ACLU of Florida, Campaign Legal Center, Demos, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Such changes would require an executive order by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Here are some of the other changes that the voting rights groups are calling for: Extending state-mandated early voting in the counties affected by the storm from Oct. 29 through Nov. 5 to Oct. 24 through Nov. 7, or allow individual supervisors of elections in those counties to conduct early voting every day beginning Oct. 24 through Nov. 7; Extend the mandatory early voting hours in affected counties from 8 hours to 12 hours per day through the early voting period; Allow supervisors of elections in affected counties to designate additional early voting sites; Allow supervisors of elections in affected counties to accept written (including email) or telephone request for a vote-by-mail ballot to be mailed to an address other than the voter’s address on file; Allow supervisors of elections to move or consolidate polling locations; and Allow voters in affected counties to cast their ballots at any polling location within the county.</p>

Local, state and federal officials, alongside political experts, have repeatedly debunked claims of election fraud but clerks in Chaffee, Eagle, El Paso, Fremont, Garfield, Summit and Weld counties told the Denver Post they’re still seeing an increasing number of bad-faith poll watchers and election judges around the state. The<a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/news/press-releases/2022/10/07/state-board-issues-guidance-maintaining-safe-and-orderly-polling-places"> North Carolina</a> State Board of Elections, which had previously been rebuffed by another state agency from tightening the rules for poll watchers, late last week released detailed guidance aimed at ensuring all voters can safely and securely cast their ballot and election officials can perform their duties free of harassment, intimidation, and interference. “The State Board of Elections is committed to ensuring all voters can cast their ballot safely, securely, and free from interference of any kind,” Brinson Bell said. “We also must ensure that trained election workers can carry out their duties free from harassment, intimidation, and interference.” The bipartisan<a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/wi/madison/politics/2022/10/10/elections-commission-rejects-guidance-for-poll-observers"> Wisconsin</a> Elections Commission failed to pass a Republican motion during a special meeting that would have provided new guidance as to what observers would be allowed to do at the polls on Election Day. Chair Don Millis, who was appointed to the commission by Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, said the issue had been raised by members of the public at last month&#8217;s regularly scheduled meeting. “I do think it&#8217;s important to act prior to the November election,” Millis explained. “This is not changing an election process or a voting process.” However, Democrats on the commission raised concerns that proposed guidance would allow observers to be within three feet of the table where voters announce their name and address and receive a number at the polling location.</p>

Council’s efforts to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last week, D.C. Council approved the first of two votes needed to allow non-citizens living in the District to vote in local elections. It would allow visa or green card holders as well as undocumented immigrants and permanent residents to vote in elections for Mayor, D.C. Council, and Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, among others. But two new bills have been introduced in the House to try and block those measures. The first is the</span><a href="https://republicans-cha.house.gov/american-confidence-elections-act"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> American Confidence in Elections Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or ACE Act, introduced by Illinois Republican Congressman Rodney Davis, which would require a photo ID in order to vote. This is a measure D.C. Council is trying to remove with the Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2021. Davis’ bill would also ban same-day registration and ballot harvesting and would require post-election audits. The ACE Act cites the district as an example and would “exercise Congress’ responsibility over D.C. to implement election integrity measures outlined in the model state legislation.” The second is not out rightly named but described by Texas Republican Congressman August Pfluger also aims to block the bill proposed by D.C. Council. In a press release, Pfluger specifically highlighted his concern with the 30-day period required to vote in D.C. elections. D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton fired back at the two congressmen.  “The notion that they’re meddling with elections in D.C. not only frustrates me but emboldens me to go after them. That’s not their concern,” Congresswoman Holmes Norton said. “We’re not talking about federal elections. We’re talking about people who vote in D.C. and only in D.C.”</span></p>

Gretchen Whitmer signed into law legislation that would<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/10/07/whitmer-signs-ballot-preprocessing-bill/69534507007/"> allow election officials to carry out the initial steps of processing absentee ballots before Election Day</a> without counting any votes. But some clerks say that the proposal that emerged from negotiations between Whitmer and GOP state lawmakers won&#8217;t help them handle the large volume of absentee ballots on Election Day and expedite election night returns. &#8220;They missed the mark. They missed the mark entirely,&#8221; said Canton Township Clerk Michael Siegrist, who does not plan to preprocess absentee ballots before Election Day. While election officials in Detroit − Michigan&#8217;s largest voting jurisdiction − plan to preprocess absentee ballots before Election Day, those in other large municipalities − including Livonia and Sterling Heights − said they&#8217;ll skip it. Whitmer&#8217;s office wrote in a news release touting the legislation that clerks who don&#8217;t use preprocessing this year &#8220;will be able to take advantage of this law and speed up election results in future election cycles.&#8221; The bill signed by Whitmer gives election officials in communities home to at least 10,000 residents from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. the Sunday and Monday preceding the election to open the return envelopes containing absentee ballots and check that the number on the stub attached to the ballot matches the number on the envelope. Clerks cannot remove absentee ballots from the secrecy sleeve or tabulate them. &#8220;Honestly, to open envelopes, take them out of the envelope and leave them in the secrecy sleeve doesn&#8217;t do much to eliminate time,&#8221; said Livonia City Clerk Susan Nash.</p>

Councilors Isaac Benton and Tammy Fiebelkorn introduced the legislation. The idea behind ranked-choice voting is to avoid costly run-off elections by allowing an automatic run-off based on how voters rank the candidates. Since 2013, the city has spent more than $2.4 million on runoff elections. If approved by councilors, it wouldn’t go into effect until the municipal elections next year. Similar legislation was brought up in 2019. Councilors did not pass it then because it was too close to election day, and they didn’t have enough time to educate voters about the system.</p>

Sam Marcellino, chair of council’s Safety and Health Committee, who introduced the legislation, said it&#8217;s a preventative measure for Bexley and was prompted by previous incidents around the country. “This (ordinance) gives us some teeth to make sure that we can hold anybody in violation of this ordinance accountable,” Marcellino said at council’s first reading Sept. 27. “We do have an election coming up here in this November, and we&#8217;d like for this to be in place by the time that election takes place.” For the ordinance to be in effect by the Nov. 8 election, legislation will go into effect immediately if approved by council and signed by Mayor Ben Kessler, foregoing the usual 30-day waiting period, City Attorney Marc Fishel said. “It’s modeled after an ordinance that was recently passed by Upper Arlington,” Fishel said. “It gives the Bexley Police Department, should there be a problem, a little bit of extra teeth to be able to take action immediately and not deal with it after the fact.” The ordinance would ban anyone other than a resident waiting to vote from standing or loitering, influencing or attempting to influence a voter within 100 feet of a poll or voting place during the hours when polls and voting places are open or hindering or interfering with an election official in the execution of his or her duties. Any violation would be a first-degree misdemeanor.</p>

Under the ordinance, sponsored by Councilmember Emmanuel V. Remy, anyone who threatens a poll worker is guilty of election interference, a first-degree misdemeanor, and is mandated to spend three days behind bars. Current state law permits poll workers to take civil action in the case of harassment, according to the Ohio Revised Code. While Sellers said no physical threats of violence have been reported against Franklin County election workers, the county’s board of elections makes “at least several” calls to law enforcement on Election Day due to activity that violates the city’s proposed ordinance.</p>

The groups had gathered over 14,000 signatures in support of the petition. In the end, El Paso city Reps. Cassandra Hernandez, Cissy Lizarraga, Joe Molinar and Claudia Rodriguez voted for a motion to deny the three ordinance proposals, which would have capped individual campaign contributions, provided public funding for community candidates and introduced ranked-choice voting in local elections. If approved by the council, the propositions would have become local ordinances. The groups now have the option of collecting a second round of signatures to have the three propositions appear before voters in May. Two of the propositions were campaign-finance related and the third would have implemented ranked choice voting: Proposition C: The city of El Paso shall use ranked choice voting for the election of mayor and City Council where voters rank candidates (up to five) in order of preference, and if no candidate receives a majority, candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated and the votes they received are transferred to voter’s second choice, and so on until there is a majority vote for one candidate, so long as permitted by state law.</span></p>

Tim Ramthun (R-Campbellsport) is looking for co-sponsors for a bill that would</span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/brief/ramthun-circulates-bill-to-impeach-wec-administrator-for-corruption/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> impeach Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) Administrator Meagan Wolfe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for “corrupt conduct in office.” Ramthun is  one of the most right-wing members of the Legislature and a former Republican candidate for governor who ran largely on a platform of 2020 election denialism. The bill is largely a rehashing of the many Republican complaints about the administration of the 2020 election and the WEC itself. The 22-page bill includes references to many of the characters and actions that election conspiracists have focused on as evidence that Wolfe acted wrongfully. In some of the cases, the decision she’s accused of making corruptly was actually the responsibility of the six appointed members of the WEC. The bill points to the use of absentee ballot drop boxes, the acceptance of outside grant money by mostly Democratic cities to aid election administration, the decision by the six commissioners to forgo sending voting assistants into nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic and the use of an online portal to allow requests of absentee ballots as evidence of Wolfe’s corruption.  Ramthun’s co-sponsorship memo gives legislators until Oct. 21 to sign on.</span></p>

Council member Denise Fenton urged her colleagues to show a united front. Appleton election officials have been yelled at, sworn at and accused of inappropriate actions, Fenton said, and she hoped the city won&#8217;t have to budget money to reinforce the windows at the city clerk&#8217;s office or to hire extra security at polling places. &#8220;I believe the very least we can do for these hard-working city staff members and citizen election inspectors who ensure that we have free, fair and accessible elections is to show them that the Common Council is united in support of their work and of nonpartisan election administration,&#8221; Fenton said. However, two councilmembers voted against the resolution citing their frustration that it was “just words”. Council member Sheri Hartzheim said she supports election officials in Appleton, noting she has worked four elections in the city, but reiterated her opposition to resolutions that make a statement but don&#8217;t call for action. The final vote was 13-2.</p>

Although the legislation was drafted, Co-Chairman Rep. Dan Zwonitzer, R-Cheyenne, told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle on Wednesday that he reviewed the legislation this week, and it was not what he envisioned. The bill was expected to be voted on at the meeting this Friday, along with drafts addressing election systems, vacancies in elected offices and election records. “I was pushing for just letting the four statewide elected officials on the canvassing board oversee a director, who oversaw the office of elections,” he said. “That turned into much more a commission of independently appointed people, more than I was anticipating.” The draft bill provided by Zwonitzer stated the commission would consist of six members appointed by the governor with the consent of the Senate. No more than four members would be from the same political party, and the governor could remove members. They would be appointed for a term of four years, and three of the initial members would get two years. A commission would be responsible for hiring an executive director. Language in the bill also removed “the secretary of state is the chief election officer for the state,” and replaced it with the “elections commission shall oversee elections as provided in this election code.” Any mention of secretary of state in regard to election statute was replaced with election commission, except in cases when the secretary of state and commission worked collaboratively on the budget or providing a notice of “the referendum ballot proposition to the elections commission.” It would leave the secretary of state on the State Canvassing Board.</span></p>

Sullivan ruled that<a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/3678315-federal-judge-says-dejoy-changes-to-postal-service-before-2020-election-harmed-delivery/"> the U.S. Postal Service failed to seek the advice of the Postal Regulatory Commission</a>, as was required, before making the substantial changes that resulted in slowed delivery. Sullivan noted that the several states, counties and cities who filed suit against DeJoy and the Postal Service had shown that the delays affected their ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide safe alternatives to in-person voting.  “Indeed, after the changes were implemented, the record shows that service scores precipitously declined in late July and had not fully rebounded by October 2020,” Sullivan wrote, concluding that the harm caused was “fairly traceable” to the agency’s changes. In June and July 2020, DeJoy implemented several significant changes to the U.S. Postal Service. As part of an initiative to optimize the number of sorting machines, the agency eliminated several hundred machines in a two-month span. The agency also sought to reduce unearned overtime, eliminate late and extra trips, and move sorting to the afternoon to start routes earlier. The U.S. Postal Service’s general counsel also told many states that if they did not pay first class postage on ballots that voters might not receive them in time to return them by mail.  Most of these changes were reversed or paused in the following months. The agency halted the removal of sorting machines until after the 2020 election and instructed its employees to prioritize election mail no matter the paid class. While Sullivan ruled partly in favor of the group filing suit, he rejected several other claims, including that the Postal Service intended to impair the administration of the election. A spokesperson for the U.S. Postal Service noted in a statement to The Hill that the agency remains “fully committed to the secure, timely delivery of the nation’s Election Mail.” “Any suggestion that the Postal Service or anyone in Postal Service leadership, up to and including the Postmaster General, at any point in time was not fully committed to supporting our democratic process is inconsistent with the facts and our performance in 2020 and 2021,” the spokesperson added.</p>

In an opinion issued last week, U.S. District Court Judge Myron Thompson wrote that Greater Birmingham Ministries, the nonprofit suing the Alabama Secretary of State’s office, is entitled to receive the voting records ahead of the November election. Merrill’s office had refused to provide some documents requested by the organization and offered to provide others for a total of over $1,000. Danielle Lang, senior director of voting rights at Campaign Legal Center, who filed the suit on GBM’s behalf, applauded the judge’s decision.  “Greater Birmingham Ministries strengthens our democracy by bringing more Alabamians into the democratic process,” Lang said. “This work is impossible to do when the Secretary of State stonewalls access to voter purge records that they are required to disclose under the law.” The National Voter Registration Act requires that certain voting-related documents be maintained and made available for public inspection “at a reasonable cost,” the judge wrote. The records requested by the organization included data on three categories of individuals: Records concerning people removed from Alabama’s voter rolls due to a disqualifying felony conviction; Records concerning people whose voter-registration applications were denied due to a felony conviction; and List of all people removed from the voter rolls after the 2020 election. Merrill’s office had argued that because he would be required to extract the relevant information from a larger database, thereby creating a “new record,” federal law did not require disclosure of the data. His office would have to either disclose the entire database or nothing at all, he argued.</p>

No hearing date on the appeal is set, appeals court records show. The court granted the stay on Sept. 28, court records show. The executive director of the group that brought the suit said Thursday that the appeal probably will not be resolved until after the first of the year. Arkansas Act 658 of 2009 says in part no one &#8220;other than poll workers shall assist more than six voters in marking and casting a ballot at an election.&#8221; The shortage of poll workers fluent in Spanish and other languages limited the help non-English proficient voters could get, claimed the Nov. 2, 2020, lawsuit filed by Arkansas United, a Springdale-based immigrant rights group. The group filed suit in U.S. District Court in Fayetteville. U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks of Fayetteville ruled on Aug. 19 of this year that the Arkansas law violates the federal Voting Rights Act. The federal act says someone needing help reading or writing to vote may choose the person to assist them, including a need for a translator. If a voter&#8217;s chosen translator had already helped six people, the Arkansas law would deny that seventh voter the translator of choice, Brooks ruled. Brooks ruled on the case Aug. 19, which was 10 months after the final briefs making arguments in the case were filed. By the time he ruled, it was too close to the election to make serious changes to election ground rules, according to arguments made for the 8th Circuit&#8217;s stay. The appeal also challenges the plaintiff&#8217;s standing to bring the suit, among other arguments. The secretary of state&#8217;s office appealed Woods&#8217; ruling, and their plea drew the support of The Honest Elections Project, a Virginia-based conservative group. The group filed an amicus, or &#8220;friend of the court,&#8221; brief supporting the secretary of state&#8217;s request for a stay of Brooks&#8217; ruling pending appeal. The elections project &#8220;has a significant interest in this case, as it implicates the Legislature&#8217;s preeminent role in setting the rules for elections and election-related litigation,&#8221; according to its brief in the Arkansas case.</p>

A judge granted a temporary restraining order against the El Paso County man who documents say visited the Dominion office building, sought entrance to the offices, ranted about election security, and admitted to having guns in his car. In signed affidavits, both Dominion CEO John Poulos and John Bronson, a Denver police sergeant, said they saw the man at the Dominion off ices and saw a scope and rifle case in the back of his car on two different occasions. Poulos said that he was called by a Dominion employee on Sep. 23 and told not to come into the office because there was an unidentified person in the lobby who was trying to get inside. When he got there hours later, Poulos said he went out to get the license plate number so he could contact police and saw a rifle scope and case. He then asked an employee to call the police. While they waited for police, Poulos said he saw the man walking around and filmed him &#8220;scoping out&#8221; the Dominion building. In his complaint, Poulos said he believes he and his employees are in &#8220;imminent danger&#8221; from the man and that he believes the man &#8220;will cause physical or emotional harm&#8221; if he&#8217;s allowed at the office building. In Poulos&#8217; request for a restraining order, he asked for the man not to be allowed within 100 yards of the Dominion office and not to be allowed to have contact with Poulos or any other employee, including posting about Dominion on social media. A judge granted the order and added that the man &#8220;shall not possess and/or purchase a firearm, ammunition, or other weapon.&#8221;</p>

John Carney and Democrat lawmakers. The court’s decision comes a month ahead of the Nov. 8 general election and while the Department of Elections was preparing to send mail ballots to voters on Oct. 10. The ruling means this will not happen and Delaware will return to its more limited, pre-pandemic voting setup where one must vote in person or have an excuse to vote absentee and one must register weeks in advance of an election to cast a ballot. Delawareans must now register to vote by Oct. 15. Debate over the legitimacy of the voting changes, enacted by lawmakers this past summer, centered on whether the state’s constitution would allow all registered voters to cast their ballot through the mail as well as whether allowing people to register to vote all the way up to Election Day is allowed by the provisions of that document. The justices wrote that the vote-by-mail legislation “impermissibly expands the categories of absentee voters identified” in the state constitution. The same-day registration law also conflicts with articles of the constitution, the justices wrote.</p>

The lawsuit against Glenn and election board member Charles Leone was filed  by the state and county Republican party and Thomas Dixon, the Republican member of the election board. In a press release, the party said the suit aims to<a href="https://www.wvpe.org/wvpe-news/2022-10-10/indiana-republican-party-files-lawsuit-against-st-joseph-county-election-board"> block a resolution passed by the election board</a> over the objections of Dixon that delegates board powers covering the processing and storage of absentee ballots to Glenn for the 2022 general election. The party said that would strip Dixon of the power to review signatures on absentee ballots and have sole access to the Republican key to the ballot storage room. Glenn is currently under investigation by the Indiana State Police over allegations that her office violated Indiana law by how it handled absentee ballots in the May 2022 primary, as well as the existence of multiple keys to the ballot storage room. Under state statutes, the room is supposed to have two locks — one Republican and one Democrat — so both parties know when it is accessed. The suit was filed in Marshall County and asks for an injunction to block the resolution’s effects.

The ruling comes after an expedited legal battle between Cox and the State Board of Elections over a petition to suspend an outdated law that prohibits election officials from canvassing mail-in ballots until two days after the election — the only law of its kind in the country. A Montgomery County Circuit Court judge sided with the state board and suspended the law, allowing counting to begin on Oct. 1. A panel of judges on Friday upheld that decision, which Cox had appealed, arguing among other things that the state legislature and not the judiciary should control changes to election rules. Under the ruling, local election workers can count mail-in ballots as they trickle in. As of Friday morning, no local election board had started the canvassing process; voters only began receiving ballots by mail at the end of September. Montgomery County, the state’s most populous, which had the longest delays during the primary, plans to start counting on Oct. 15.</p>

Challengers can observe elections and can contest a voter&#8217;s eligibility or a procedure while poll watchers can observe polling locations and absentee counting boards. Michigan Court of Claims Judge Brock Swartzle − a former Republican-nominated Michigan Supreme Court candidate − could soon decide the legality of the new guidance for election challengers issued by the state&#8217;s Bureau of Elections ahead of the August primary. A ruling invalidating the guidance could force last-minute and wide-ranging changes over the process in place for election challengers. Michigan GOP and the Republican National Committee filed a legal challenge in late September alleging that the new instructions for election challengers and poll watchers issued by the Bureau of Elections conflict with Michigan election law and include directives that needed to undergo a rule-making process with input from the public and state lawmakers. The lawsuit challenges a slew of instructions in the guidance, including those requiring challengers to have a credential issued using a form from the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office. In Southfield, a Republican challenger was barred from serving as a challenger in the primary for failing to use the Secretary of State&#8217;s credential form even though challengers who used the same form from the Michigan GOP had their credentials accepted everywhere else, according to the party. The legal challenge also contests other elements of the instructions, including those that bar the use of cell phones and other electronic devices by challengers observing absentee counting boards and prohibit challengers from speaking to election workers not designated as challenger liaisons.</span></p>

As part of the agreement, Clark County will provide a list of poll workers’ political party affiliations and job titles or assignment for each poll location, including signature verification and county board teams. The RNC has agreed to not ask for the names of the poll workers, according to court documents. The RNC filed the lawsuit last month after the county denied a request to produce the full name, title and party affiliation of all poll workers employed in the 2022 primary election as well as those hired for the general election. Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria cited privacy concerns and risk of harassment in refusing the request. The RNC had argued that since poll workers were paid with taxpayer funds, that information should not be considered confidential. State law requires that election board officers at any polling location can’t all be registered members of the same political party. The case is stayed until Dec. 23, after which the RNC says it will drop the lawsuit unless there are any pending disputes between the two sides.</p>

The Spirit Lake Tribe, and members Collette Brown and Lois Leben, who are Benson County voters, claim a Benson County redistricting plan adopted Dec. 28, 2021 violates Native Americans’ voting rights and restricts their voting strength by requiring Benson County Commissioners to be elected on an at-large basis, rather than by district.  On an at-large basis, all voters across the county vote for commissioners. In a district system, commissioners would be elected by the people who live in the district where the candidate lives. The lawsuit alleges the county’s adoption of an at-large voting system intentionally limits the voting power of Native Americans in Benson County, and is in violation of the Voting Rights Act, a legal agreement from a previous lawsuit and the 14th and 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The 14th Amendment guarantees that all people receive equal treatment under the same laws. The 15th Amendment protects the voting rights of all citizens, regardless of race or skin color. According to court documents, since 2000, Benson County has been subject to a consent decree, or legal agreement, that prohibits the county from holding county commissioner elections on an at-large basis because it lessens Native American voting strength. The consent decree was a result of the court case United States v. Benson County, which alleged the at-large voting system at the time violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The consent decree also says Benson County’s voting plan must provide for five single-members districts, with at least two majority-Native American voting districts. From 2000 to 2021, the population of voting-age Native Americans in Benson County has grown from 29% of the county’s population to 46% of the county’s population.</p>

It does not change the outcome of the underlying 2021 election for Lehigh County judge. “We think [Tuesday’s decision] reflects that the decision of the 3rd Circuit warranted further review and, but for the matter becoming moot, they would have granted that review and reversed the opinion on the merits,” Attorney Joshua Voss said. Pennsylvania acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman said during a virtual press conference that the department was reviewing the decision and would advise counties accordingly. Existing guidance from the Department of State instructs counties to count ballots that are missing a date or have the incorrect date, but Chapman said officials will evaluate and update directives as necessary. In a statement, Chapman said counties are “expected to include undated ballots in their official returns” for the November election. “That guidance followed the most recent ruling of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court holding that both Pennsylvania and federal law prohibit excluding legal votes because the voter omitted an irrelevant date on the ballot return envelope,” she said. “Today’s order from the U.S. Supreme Court vacating the Third Circuit’s decision on mootness grounds was not based on the merits of the issue and does not affect the prior decision of Commonwealth Court in any way. It provides no justification for counties to exclude ballots based on a minor omission, and we expect that counties will continue to comply with their obligation to count all legal votes.”</p>

Hoyt warned Houston-based attorneys Brock Akers and Mike Brewer that they might be getting “played” by their conservative nonprofit client after the attorneys repeatedly argued against disclosing the source of the information central to the case, about sensitive poll worker data managed by Konnech Inc. Attorneys for True the Vote said that contrary to their prior public statements, the group had never been in possession of Konnech’s data but had simply been shown it by a source. Konnech’s lawyers, meanwhile, asked the judge to hold True the Vote’s founder, Catherine Engelbrecht, and a board member<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23127699-konnech-motion-to-show-cause-and-for-contempt"> in contempt</a> for failing to follow the judge’s order. The judge said he didn’t “have any confidence” in True the Vote’s version of events, in part because he said the group’s leaders haven’t submitted sworn affidavits under penalty of perjury to support them. True the Vote’s lawyers said they didn’t believe their clients needed to appear at the hearing. After nearly two hours of arguing back and forth, Akers followed the judge’s order and looked through a stack of documents in his briefcase, hunting for the name. Once he found it, he wrote it down in a yellow notepad, ripped off the page, walked across the room, and handed it to Konnech’s attorney, Dean Pamphilis. Not satisfied, Pamphilis asked that Akers say the name out loud for the record. After Hoyt instructed him to comply, Akers did so.</p>
<p>The Texas Organizing Project is challenging Bexar County in court for<a href="https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2022/10/06/texas-organizing-project-sues-bexar-county-for-not-proposing-enough-polling-locations/"> not proposing enough polling locations</a> ahead of Election Day. The lawsuit states Bexar County is proposing the fewest number of polling locations the county has ever had for a general election. A judge agreed there was a need for more polling locations in a similar lawsuit filed against the county in 2020. The Texas Civil Rights Project represents the progressive nonprofit Texas Organizing Project in the lawsuit against Bexar County. Joaquin Gonzales, with Texas Civil Rights Project, said there are not enough places where voters can cast a ballot. Bexar County uses a countywide polling program, meaning<a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/EL/htm/EL.43.htm"> state law</a> requires the number of polling locations to be half the number of precincts. There are 766 precincts in the county, so there should be a minimum of 388 polling locations. The elections office is proposing 267. “Which would also be the fewest locations we’ve ever had for a general election,” Joaquin Gonzales, with Texas Civil Rights Project said. Judge Martha Tanner<a href="https://sanantonioreport.org/judge-ruling-bexar-county-election-day-polling-places/"> ruled this week</a> that the county must add more polling places. defendants imminently stand to violate Texas Election Code Section” by planning to operate too few voting locations. The law calls for voting locations in at least half of the county’s 776 election precincts, unless the proper process has been followed to combine locations. Tanner ordered the county to “solicit the input of persons or organizations representing minority voters in adopting its methodology for choosing countywide polling locations by holding at least one public hearing to which such persons or organizations are invited.” The locations should be determined and posted online by Oct. 18, according to the ruling.</p>

The suit claimed election malfeasance in connection with the defeat of a 2019 proposal to remove fluoride from the city’s water system. Plaintiffs said poll watchers were “obstructed” on election night and during a recount of the votes; that more than 400 ballots were not signed by an election judge and shouldn’t have been counted; and that more than 30 ballots were missing. Fredericksburg City Attorney Daniel Jones called witnesses to rebut the allegations, including the 2019 election judge who failed to sign the ballots in question. When Jones asked why he didn’t sign the ballots, he said he just “completely forgot.” </span></p>

The group was created in July by former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, longtime Republican strategist Karl Rove, GOP donor Steve Wynn and others. The group has also filed election-related lawsuits in the battleground states of Arizona and Pennsylvania. Schimel, who was attorney general from 2015 to 2019, sided with RITE and ordered the election commission to rescind its guidance. He also denied a request to put his oral ruling on hold. On Monday, the Democratic National Committee, which was intervening in the suit, was<a href="https://www.wpr.org/ruling-halting-ballot-spoiling-across-wisconsin-has-been-put-hold"> granted a stay</a> that puts Schimel&#8217;s injunction on hold while the appeals court decides whether to take up the case.</p>
<p>Dane County Judge Juan Colas refused Oct. 7 to issue a temporary order that would allow local<a href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/dane-county-judge-refuses-to-immediately-allow-partial-absentee-addresses/"> election clerks to accept partial witness addresses on absentee ballots</a>. A group called Rise Inc. filed a lawsuit in September seeking a judicial order requiring the Wisconsin Elections Commission to tell local clerks that they must accept ballots as long as the witness address includes enough information that clerks can reasonably discern where the witness can be contacted. The day after the group filed the lawsuit its attorneys asked Judge Juan Colas to issue a temporary injunction mandating the commission issue that guidance to clerks. Colas refused to issue the order during a hearing on the morning of Oct. 7, online court records indicate. The case will continue with a scheduling conference set for Oct. 17.</p>
<p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Kristy Yang has<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/11/judge-dismisses-gop-lawsuit-over-milwaukee-election-records/10465438002/"> dismissed an open records lawsuit</a> filed against the Milwaukee Election Commission after the plaintiffs—the Republican Party of Wisconsin—said it had received the records originally requested. Republicans were seeking records from the Milwaukee Election Commission and mayor’s office related to a get-out-the-vote campaign that conservatives labeled an illegal attempt at bolstering turnout in favor of Democrats. Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson’s office has clarified that Milwaukee Votes 2022 is a privately funded and nonpartisan initiative designed to encourage voting and register voters. Republicans filed an open records request on Sept. 13 seeking communications between GPS Impact, a liberal communications firm advising on the initiative, and the mayor’s office and Milwaukee Election Commission. The party, joined by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, filed a lawsuit less than two weeks later on Sept. 26, alleging that officials weren’t responding to their request as swiftly as the law requires. Wisconsin’s open records law requires a response to requests “as soon as practicable and without delay,” but it often takes weeks or months for records to be provided.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/voter-accessibility-improving-your-election-coverage-people-disabilities">Voter Accessibility: Improving your election coverage for people with disabilities</a>:  Midterm elections are Nov. 8. Are you prepared to be a watchdog for disabled voters in your communities? What is your newsroom doing to ensure your election coverage is useful and accessible for disabled voters? How are you covering voter rights and accessibility leading up to and on Election Day?  More than 61 million Americans live with disabilities, yet they remain underrepresented in journalism produced by U.S. newsrooms.

<p><a href="https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/event/its-time-audit-every-state-every-election">It’s Time to Audit: Every State, Every Election</a>: Presented by The Heritage Foundation: While in-depth financial and accounting audits are a standard practice in the business world, they are almost nonexistent in public elections. Should all states require comprehensive audits of their voter registration, voting, and vote tabulation processes and systems? How should such audits be conducted and who should conduct them? What should auditors be reviewing and what standards should they apply to election administration? How often should audits be conducted and how many political subdivisions within a state should be audited? On the eve of the upcoming midterm elections, this timely issue is vital to ensuring the honesty and integrity of elections. Join us for a discussion of this important topic with current and former election officials. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> October 20, 12pm Eastern</p>
<p><a href="https://voteearlyday.org/">Vote Early Day</a>: Vote Early Day is a nonpartisan movement of media companies, businesses, nonprofits, election administrators, and creatives working to ensure all Americans have the tools to vote early. This holiday is a tentpole moment for partners of all stripes to engage with voters and urge them to cast their ballots. Created in 2020, Vote Early Day has brought thousands of national and local partners together in celebration and activation to increase the number of people voting early. This collaborative, open-source model—similar to Giving Tuesday and National Voter Registration Day—ensures that millions more Americans take advantage of their options to vote early through on the ground activations, get-out-the-vote pushes, national communications on traditional and social media, and efforts to create a new culture around voting. Vote Early Day plays a unique role in the push to get voters to cast their ballot. We are a trusted, nonpartisan holiday with supporters on both sides of the aisle. We provide a central moment for a wide range of partners (many non- traditional to the civic space) to engage with voters and urge them to vote early. Our collaboration of thousands of diverse partners allows us to engage in places beyond where voters are used to seeing election messages. This allows us to break through the noise and meet voters where they are. <strong>When:</strong> October 28</p>
