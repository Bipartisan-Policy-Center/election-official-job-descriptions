							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Introducing the U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence</strong><br />
<em>A nonpartisan collaborative that’s bringing together election officials, designers, technologists, and other experts to revitalize American democracy</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8317" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tiana-TED-2-300x171.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tiana-TED-2-300x171.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tiana-TED-2-768x438.jpeg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tiana-TED-2.jpeg 988w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />At the April TED 2022 conference, the Center for Tech and Civic Life announced it’s launching a new nonpartisan program, the<a href="https://www.electionexcellence.org/"> U.S. Alliance for Election </a><a href="https://www.electionexcellence.org/">Excellence</a>. The Alliance, which is open to every election department in the nation, is bringing together bipartisan election officials to rally around a set of common values and standards, support each other, and keep their skills fresh.</p>
<p>In 2020, CTCL distributed<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/10-facts-about-ctcl-grants/"> nearly $350 million in grants</a> to local election departments to administer safe elections. During that program, it became clear that U.S. local election departments remain woefully unsupported. One small jurisdiction reported not being able to replace<a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/2020covidsupport/"> century-old tabulators</a> until receiving a CTCL grant. Many also still struggled to maintain modern websites with easy-to-find information for voters. The Alliance is a response to feedback from local election officials and their needs after the 2020 program.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8318" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CTCL-Twitter_Post-2-300x169.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CTCL-Twitter_Post-2-300x169.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CTCL-Twitter_Post-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CTCL-Twitter_Post-2-768x432.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CTCL-Twitter_Post-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CTCL-Twitter_Post-2-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Every American voter, no matter their zip code, should have access to a process that is fair and trustworthy,” said Tiana Epps-Johnson, executive director of the Center for Tech and Civic Life. “Unfortunately, years of under-investment means many local election departments often have limited capacity and training. The U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence will bring together world-class partners so that local election officials no longer have to go it alone.”</p>
<p>“Regardless of size or location, local election offices and their staff benefit from being connected with and learning from each other,” said Al Schmidt, President and CEO of the Committee of Seventy and former Philadelphia city commissioner. “I appreciate how the Alliance is centering local election departments – and voters – in their work.”</p>

The<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2022-04-26/nh-voter-comission-scanlan-elections"> Commission on Voter Confidence</a> will be co-chaired by New Hampshire Ballot Law Commission Chair Brad Cook, as well as former Ambassador to Denmark and Congressman Richard Swett. The commission will hold listening sessions across the state in the coming months, gathering input from citizens on how the state could improve transparency in the voting process. Members of the commission will also work to explain New Hampshire’s process for casting and counting votes, a largely decentralized process that involves thousands of local election officials and volunteers. “Our challenge is to make the process more transparent, help people understand it, so that there is no mystery,” Scanlan said. “If we can do that, it is much harder to create a situation where people can claim conspiracies.” Scanlan didn’t put a timetable on when the commission may conclude its work, but he stressed the urgency of state and local election officials stemming growing mistrust in the process. When voters lack faith, he warned, they may stop voting. “If you start losing voter participation in elections, it starts becoming more difficult to govern, as well,” Scanlan said. “People lose confidence, not only in the election, but the institutions of their government.”</p>

Here’s an excerpt: “…Tabulators boost the integrity of election systems nationwide by improving accurate and timely results and reducing resource demands on election offices. We encourage states and localities to redirect their focus on hand counts toward other, evidence-based integrity measures. The best way to enhance the legitimacy of election results is to pair the use of tabulators with robust tabulation audits of paper ballots after every election, as noted in the Task Force’s report <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/bipartisan-principles-for-election-audits/">Bipartisan Principles for Election Audits</a>. Hand recounts of single races alone often take days and hundreds of additional workers to complete; hand counting full ballots with dozens of contests could take weeks or months. This would require a significant expansion in the number of election workers, which is untenable when jurisdictions nationwide already struggle to staff in-person voting operations…”BPC Elections also released an<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/how-ballot-tabulators-improve-elections/"> explainer</a> further exploring how tabulators, paper ballots, and regular audits can collectively enhance election integrity.</p>

Kennedy Profile in Courage Award was recently granted to five individuals, including Michigan Secretary of State<a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/events-and-awards/profile-in-courage-award/award-recipients/defending-democracy-2022/jocelyn-benson"> Jocelyn Benson</a> and Fulton County, Georgia election worker<a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/events-and-awards/profile-in-courage-award/award-recipients/defending-democracy-2022/wandrea-shaye-moss"> Wandrea “Shaye” Moss</a>. Other awardees were Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming) and Arizona House Speaker Russell “Rusty” Bowers. The John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award was created in 1989 by members of President Kennedy&#8217;s family to honor President John F. Kennedy and to recognize and celebrate the quality of political courage that he admired most. “There is no issue today more important than the fight for democracy. These honorees have placed their careers and lives on the line to protect democratic principles and free and fair elections. They embody what President Kennedy admired most in others—political courage.” This is the first time five people have been honored in the same year.</p>

The Cache County, Utah clerk/auditor’s office is dealing with a snake problem. According to The Herald Journal, when Cache County Clerk/Auditor Jess Bradfield and his staff entered the building they were given for counting ballots and storing election equipment, they were surprised to see the dead bodies of multiple snakes scattered about the floor. “We immediately noticed that there were dead snakes in the main area, and we didn’t think too much of it because dead snakes are dead snakes. So then we thought let’s get traps and set them out in case we have mice issues,” Bradfield said told the paper. “But every time we went back into the building, we caught at least two to three snakes.” after catching their first two, Bradfield and his staff knew they had an infestation. “We started to look closer, and we started to see snakes peeking out from under the walls inside the building,” Bradfield said. “Outside, in the cracks, we also saw snakes peeking out because one of our doors had rotted all the way through and the snakes had an apartment inside our door frame.” Bradfield move ballot counting to the building to provide more opportunities for the public to watch the process.</p>

Ron DeSantis (R) has signed a bill into law that creates a<a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/os-ne-desantis-election-crimes-police-20220425-4t35acj6tbf7jffhgg3l3eqv2i-story.html"> statewide voter fraud force</a> to respond to allegations of illegal election activity reported by citizens, despite the state’s successful management of the 2020 election and no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Florida. The bill, which was passed by the House and Senate along party lines, creates the Office of Election Crimes and Security, which Democrats said was redundant and an unjustified expenditure of state tax dollars. Democrats, the ACLU, League of Women Voters and other civic groups have objected that the bill creates more voter suppression and that voter fraud is an excuse to make it harder, not easier, for people to vote. The Legislature has put $1.15 million in the budget to create the Office with 15 new hires. The budget also contains a little over $1 million for 15 new positions in the Division of Elections “specifically related to voter registration activities.” And the Criminal Justice and Corrections budget has $2 million for 17 positions for campaign finance and election fraud enforcement.</p>

It was approved by the Senate earlier in April by a 28-8 vote. Under the legislation, counties would have to use ballots printed on watermark paper. The bill would prohibit counties from using voting equipment with the capability of being connected to the internet. County election officers would have to provide precinct-level election results electronically within 30 days for federal, statewide, legislative and local races. Counties would be able to issue bonds to finance the purchase, lease or rental of electronic poll books for use at voting sites and for advance voting. After July 1, counties wouldn’t be able to purchase electronic poll books unless the system was certified by Secretary of State Scott Schwab. The bill would create a mechanism for people to be removed from voter registration lists. The protocol would be triggered if an address confirmation notice was returned “undeliverable” and the intended recipient had no voting activity in two subsequent federal election cycles. Additionally, the bill headed would create an election audit procedure performed by the secretary of state that would randomly select four counties for post-election examinations. One county would have a population greater than 90,000 and one county would have a population between 20,000 and 90,000. Two smaller counties with less than 20,000 people would be audited. No additional funds were included with the legislation and the implementation of the watermark portion of the bill is expected to cost counties about $1 per ballot.</p>

Tate Reeves vetoed a bill intended to make it easier for some people who lost their voting rights as a result of a<a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2022/04/23/tate-reeves-vetoes-felony-disenfranchisement-mississippi/"> Jim Crow-era provision of the state’s 1890 Constitution</a> to regain their right to vote. The constitutional provision prohibits those convicted of certain felonies from being able to vote unless their suffrage rights are restored by a two-thirds vote of both chambers of the Legislature or by a gubernatorial pardon. House Judiciary B Chair Nick Bain, a Republican from Corinth who drafted the language that was vetoed, said during the session many courts already are restoring voting rights to those whose crimes are expunged. He said he believes that was the original intent of the legislation, and the bill he offered during the 2022 session, simply “clarified” that all judges should be granting the rights to vote to those whose crimes are expunged. But Reeves vetoed the “clarifying” language. “Felony disenfranchisement is an animating principle of the social contract at the heart of every great republic dating back to the founding of ancient Greece and Rome,” the Republican Reeves wrote in his veto message, which was filed with the Legislature on Friday.</p>

If the measure is signed into law, it would change same-day voter registration, but it could face a significant barrier: Gov. Chris Sununu has said he opposes the provisional ballot system, which he said could jeopardize the state’s first-in-the-nation primary. The governor stopped short of saying whether he would veto the bill.   The version of<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=2108&amp;inflect=2"> Senate Bill 418</a> passed by the House would require people registering to vote for the first time in New Hampshire on Election Day without an ID to use a separate, new kind of ballot – the so-called affidavit ballot. After voting, they would have to mail documentation proving their identity to the Secretary of State’s Office. If they failed to do so, their votes would be voided – which means the results of the election might not be finalized for up to 14 days after the election, according to the bill. Republicans in both chambers have backed the bill as a measure to ensure election integrity and close what they call the no-ID loophole, while Democrats have criticized it as voter suppression.</p>

It eliminates the required confirmation of two witnesses or a notary to the signing of a mail ballot. It also calls for the creation of a permanent list of nursing home residents — and others who are disabled &#8220;for an indefinite period&#8221; — to whom mail ballot applications would be sent automatically in every election. This would stop only if a local elections clerk received &#8220;reliable information that a voter no longer qualifies for the service&#8221; for whatever reason, including death.  The Senate bill and a matching version in the House were born out of Rhode Island&#8217;s 2020, mid-pandemic attempt to make voting easier for COVID-leery voters.</p>

The bill received wide bipartisan support at the State House. Before passing the Senate, Senators made changes to the legislation House leadership and the Governor said they can’t sign off on. Senators inserted proposals from another elections bill. The sticking point is a provision that requires the Senate to confirm the Governor’s appointments to the State Election Commission. Senator Shane Massey (R-Edgefield) said this was necessary following the changes the commission made before the 2020 elections. These include the consideration of the use of drop boxes and waiving the witness signature for absentee ballots. Governor Henry McMaster has also been very critical of the Senate’s version of the bill. He said, “Unfortunately some Senators want to get into managing the election commission which is not their job. It’s not a legislative function but an executive function. This puts a poison pill in that bill.” The bill now heads back to the House.</p>

The new map is backed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who signed it into law. Wyandotte County,<a href="https://www.wral.com/kansas-judge-rejects-congressional-map-appeal-expected/20251655/"> Kansas</a> District Judge Bill Klapper struck down a new Republican-backed congressional map that would likely make it harder for the only Democrat in the state&#8217;s delegation to win reelection this year. It was the first time a court has declared that the Kansas Constitution prohibits political gerrymandering. The state attorney general&#8217;s office notified the Kansas Supreme Court almost immediately to expect an appeal of the decision. Klapper ordered legislators to draft another map after declaring that the challenged one not only was too partisan but diluted minority voters&#8217; political clout. The voting districts to elect judges to the<a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2022/04/25/lawsuit-mississippi-supreme-court-plan-violates-voting-rights-act/7409139001/"> Mississippi</a> Supreme Court are drawn in a way that denies Black voters an equal chance to participate in the political process, according to a lawsuit challenging the voting maps. The lawsuit filed by individual Black civic leaders calls for the state to draw new boundaries for three districts, which has not been done since 1987. The leaders the districts need to be redrawn to provide fair representation for Black voters and comply with the Voting Rights Act and the United States Constitution.</p>

In his filing, Brnovich, who is seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, said Hobbs, a Democrat who is running for governor, failed to produce the manual as required by law. He wants an updated manual that would include a number of provisions, many of which appear to have arisen out of his office&#8217;s investigation of the 2020 election, including concerns about unmonitored drop boxes. A preliminary report on that probe was released earlier this month to the state Senate. Hobbs&#8217; communications director called the lawsuit a &#8220;blatantly political move&#8221; by Brnovich. &#8220;It is unbelievable that he is venue shopping and colluding with a political party to sue another state official,&#8221; C. Murphy Hebert, said in a statement. &#8220;And it is most definitely the opposite of what we need to do to ensure free and fair elections this year.&#8221; According to the Arizona Republic, The lack of an updated manual is the result of a standoff between Hobbs and Brnovich. Late last year, Hobbs submitted a draft version of the manual, which must be updated every odd-numbered year, to Brnovich&#8217;s office for approval. He sent back a demand to remove more than 100 provisions, according to the complaint filed with the Yavapai court. Hobbs at the time accepted some of his deletions, but objected to others, arguing Brnovich sought to remove nearly one-third of the manual&#8217;s provisions without providing any legal justification.</p>

The machines are unreliable because they are subject to hacking, contend Kari Lake, a gubernatorial hopeful, and Mark Finchem, who is running for secretary of state. And the use of components in computers from other countries makes them vulnerable, they say. The is an even more basic problem, says Andrew Parker, the attorney who filed the lawsuit on their behalf. The tabulation of votes is an inherently governmental function, he said. Yet by using machines built and programmed by private companies the state has effectively farmed that out that obligation. It seeks a court order to have the 2022 election conducted with paper ballots which would be counted by hand, calling it “the most effective and presently the only secure election method.</p>

Barrett issued three orders denying several requests from Peters’ attorney, Harvey Steinberg, asking for those bond conditions to be relaxed on grounds that they were excessive. Peters’ $25,000 surety bond bars her from leaving the state or going to her office, including preventing her from having any contact with the employees who work there. “As this court is aware, Ms. Peters is the elected clerk and recorder for Mesa County,” Steinberg wrote in one motion. “But the conditions of her bond make it impossible for her to serve in that role. By imposing those bond conditions, the court has de facto removed Ms. Peters from office.” Barrett said the conditions he ordered earlier this month are the least restrictive he could have imposed. He wrote that Peters’ actions in this case, and other pending court matters, justifies those conditions. “The allegations here, combined with defendant’s conduct in allegedly lying to the court previously (the contempt allegation) and allegedly obstructing law enforcement in their efforts to serve a search warrant reflect an unwillingness of defendant to comply with the judicial process,” Barrett wrote.</p>

<p>The State Election Board has<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/subpoenas-seek-evidence-of-georgia-ballot-collection/CODHKLIXPFGGRMVWCVKHHZTKQA/"> issued subpoenas</a> to find out whether there’s substance behind accusations of a ballot collection scheme in the 2020 election in Georgia. The subpoenas seek evidence of allegations that unnamed organizations paid unnamed individuals $10 per absentee ballot delivered to drop boxes across metro Atlanta. The subpoenas followed a Nov. 30 complaint by True the Vote, a conservative election organization, which didn’t provide details supporting its allegations. The State Election Board voted last month to issue the subpoenas. The subpoenas compel True the Vote to turn over documents, recordings and names allegedly connected to ballot harvesting. The subpoenas also require depositions of True the Vote founder Catherine Englebrecht and her colleague Gregg Phillips. The True the Vote complaint repeated several allegations that the GBI previously reviewed in the fall before declining to open an investigation.</p>

The three-judge panel issued an order indicating it agreed that a lower court was right to dismiss DePerno&#8217;s lawsuit, pointing to a series of issues with both DePerno&#8217;s legal tactics and pleadings in a case that drew national attention. &#8220;(DePerno&#8217;s client) merely raised a series of questions about the election without making any specific factual allegations as required. Because plaintiff &#8216;failed to disclose sufficient facts and grounds and sufficient apparent merit to justify further inquiry &#8230;&#8217; the trial court properly granted summary disposition,&#8221; the judges wrote in the unanimous opinion.  Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson heralded the decision. Nessel&#8217;s office argued against DePerno on behalf of the state, telling the appellate judges the trial court correctly dismissed DePerno&#8217;s lawsuit. Benson has repeatedly defended the efforts of the Antrim County clerk and others who&#8217;ve faced unsubstantiated allegations of fraud or misconduct. “This dismissal once again affirms not only the integrity and accuracy of the 2020 election results, but that those claiming otherwise will not be able to use our legal system as a vehicle for furthering their misinformation and conspiracy theories,&#8221; Benson said in a statement. The appeals court did determine the trial court dismissed the case for the wrong reason, saying even though DePerno&#8217;s case was doomed and he could not get the relief he wanted, that the lower court improperly decided his claims were moot.  But the appeals court determined, &#8220;we will not reverse a trial court’s decision when it reaches the right result, even if for the wrong reason.&#8221;</p>

Pena has been accused of<a href="https://www.wivb.com/news/local-news/buffalo/poll-worker-accused-of-stamping-mayor-browns-name-on-numerous-ballots/"> unlawful use of pasters</a> upon ballot and an unspecified violation of election law. The first charge is a felony. Prosecutors said Pena stamped Brown’s name on numerous ballots this past Election Day.  Brown was running as a write-in candidate after losing the Democratic primary to India Walton. Voters needed to write down his name on their ballot – or stamp it, using stamps his campaign handed out. Brown ended up winning the election by more than 10,000 votes. After her arraignment, Pena was released on her own recognizance. She’ll be back in court on May 16. If convicted, Pena could spend up to four years in prison.</p>

Charges against Moses were being dismissed and she will no longer face a second trial &#8220;in the interest of judicial economy,&#8221; Shelby County district attorney Amy Weirich said in a statement. Moses, who had prior felonies, was convicted in November of registering to vote illegally in Memphis in 2019 and was sentenced Jan. 31 to six years and one day in prison. She has said she was unaware that she was ineligible to vote. At the time, legal experts said her sentence was excessive. Moses filed a motion asking for a new trial. In February, Criminal Court Judge Mark Ward overturned her conviction and granted Moses a second trial — which now won&#8217;t take place. In all, Moses has spent 82 days in custody on the case, &#8220;which is sufficient,&#8221; Weirich said in her statement.</p>

The effort will see the organization’s engineers and managers work with county- and local-level election administrators on using open-source technologies to build products like poll-location search tools, election information websites and applications that help officials manage poll workers. USDR has offered its assistance to election administrators since its founding in 2020, when it developed poll-locator tools for tribal voters in Arizona and built an app for Harris County, Texas, to recruit and organize poll workers in the country’s third-biggest voting jurisdiction. The elections program is the product of a major grant USDR recently received from the Center for Tech and Civic Life.</p>

The county also received one strike against it and was prevented from uploading videos for a week. YouTube has instituted “community guidelines” that prohibit accounts from posting content that “advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches changed the outcome of select past national elections, after final election results are officially certified.” On April 5, multiple speakers called into question the results of the 2020 and 2021 election. One woman even claimed to have been sent to the meeting by “Q,” a reference to the QAnon conspiracy theory that alleges a global ring of cannibalistic child sex abusers conspired against Trump while he was in office. The guidelines also prohibit false claims on candidate eligibility, a topic that also came up during the April 5 meeting. Supervisors ultimately ended up renewing the Dominion contract unanimously. &#8220;When it’s brought to our attention that a video has been mistakenly removed, we review the content and take appropriate action, including restoring relevant videos or channels,&#8221; a YouTube spokesperson said in an email to The Californian. &#8220;We also offer uploaders the ability to appeal removals and we will re-review the content, as we did for this video.&#8221;</p>

Baker III co-chaired the bipartisan Commission on Federal Election Reform. They understood that public confidence in elections was critical to the survival of American democracy.

On April 29, we are bringing together leading experts on election administration from across the country to discuss questions on many American’s minds: Can a presidential election be stolen? What is the electoral landscape across the country? What do the state-level legislative changes really mean for voter access and election security? <strong>When:</strong> April 29, 9:45am-3:15pm. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
