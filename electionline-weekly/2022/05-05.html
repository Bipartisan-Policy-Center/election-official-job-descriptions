														<p><strong>NSGIC reviews nation&#8217;s progress in geo-enabled elections</strong><br />
<em>New election modernization tools published</em></p>
<p>By Jamie Chesser, project lead, Geo-Enabled Elections project<br />
<a href="https://www.nsgic.org/">National States Geographic Information Counci</a>l</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7228" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.12.10-AM-300x87.png" alt="" width="300" height="87" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.12.10-AM-300x87.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.12.10-AM-768x222.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-22-at-10.12.10-AM.png 974w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Election modernization is moving forward across the U.S. in small and big ways. Take Montana, where efforts are underway to create and validate a state-wide voter GIS address layer, which will help ensure accuracy when registering voters and assigning them to the right districts. Or take Vermont, where a team of election and GIS experts recently completed a geocoding and audit of all addresses, which will ensure ballots can be delivered more accurately in upcoming elections.</p>
<p>In a recent survey of election directors around the country, about two-thirds indicated they don’t have access to &#8211; or don’t know if they have access to &#8211; a universal address list, like the one used in Montana, or the National Address Database, compiled by the Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC) has spent the last four years supporting states’ election modernization efforts through its Geo-Enabled Elections project, creating a blueprint for how states can enhance the elections process by integrating GIS. Leveraging GIS in elections improves accuracy, saves work effort, and enables greater transparency.</p>
<p>To kick off the project’s final year, NSGIC launched<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/gis-election/"> Resources for Election Directors</a> a webpage filled with tools and guidance, free to download, for any election leader looking to enhance accuracy and efficiency by further integrating GIS. Over the past four years, NSGIC has also helped build stronger bonds between the elections community and the GIS community &#8211; often an integral part of a state’s administration. For what can be more central to elections than geography and maps?</p>
<p>For states still in the beginning stages of the journey to geo-enable elections, a first destination might be their state’s geographic information officer (GIO). Not sure if such a position exists? Election administrators can locate theirs using NSGIC’s<a href="https://www.nsgic.org/states"> directory</a>. Not sure what to ask? A list of topics is available for download; the<a href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.206/e5o.95c.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5Questions_GIO_ED.pdf"> Five Questions Election Directors Can Ask Their State GIO</a>. For officials who want to grow their proficiency in the topic, NSGIC and the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL) launched a self-paced<a href="https://learn.techandciviclife.org/library/?category=Geo-Enabling+Elections"> training series</a> on how to use GIS to increase the accuracy and reliability of election data.</p>
<p>Of course, many states are much further along in this process, and might instead benefit from hearing about<a href="https://youtu.be/fFqZO2uXCcQ"> New Jersey’s experience</a> enshrining the use of GIS in elections in state statute, or learning from peers in<a href="https://nsgic.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/GEE/Tortoise_Hare_Final_Print.pdf"> Pennsylvania about the approaches they considered</a> when deciding how to go about statewide election change. NSGIC’s Resources page even offers<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/model-statutory-language-released-to-help-states-advance-gis-in-elections/"> model statutory language</a> and<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/hava-funding-gis/"> sample requests-for-proposals</a> (RFPs) to ensure any new voter registration system will be able to use GIS information for voters and district boundaries.</p>
<p>In an effort to map the progress made over the last four years, the Geo-Enabled Elections project is now focusing on a survey of the nation’s election directors. The resulting report, to be published in October, will document advances in voter address management and auditing, states’ access to technology and systems capable of using GIS location information, collaboration with state GIOs, and more. If the past few years are any indication, the report may also touch on how new technology is being deployed to increase transparency or deliver services to voters. Another possible hot topic, given the recent redistricting process, is boundary management and how voting district boundaries are codified and shared once adopted. Says NSGIC’s incoming executive director John Jordan: “If you are an election director and haven&#8217;t discussed your state’s use of GIS in elections with NSGIC recently &#8211; we want to hear from you. Please consider connecting with us today.”</p>
<p>Two previous reports with insights from election directors are already available for download; the<a href="https://nsgic.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/GEE/Election_Director_Report.pdf"> 2018 NSGIC Election Director Report</a> and the<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/nsgic-survey-nations-election-directors-technology-funding-support-for-election-modernization/"> 2021 NSGIC Election Director Survey</a>, which also touched on the financing of election modernization. In addition, pilot studies and case studies report in detail on the efforts of sixteen states and nine counties that worked to more fully geo-enable their elections. Lastly, the leading-edge findings of the project, the<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/best-practices-gis-in-elections"> Best Practices for Geo-Enabling Elections</a>, are also available for download.</p>

There were pockets of problems, but nothing major. In Indiana, several counties<a href="https://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/voter-turnout-slower-than-the-rain-at-valpo-polling-places-workers-say/article_aec8d856-9887-569a-810b-1c3deadbb71c.html"> reported</a><a href="https://www.wbaa.org/elections-politics/2022-05-03/record-low-voter-turnout-for-the-tippecanoe-county-2022-primary-election"> low</a><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/ct-ptb-primary-vote-turnout-st-0504-20220503-gttm75zfane5pbmzqg2x6cbyge-story.html"> turnout</a> which made for a slow day for poll workers.<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/vote-centers-smoothly-madison-county-104900896.html"> Madison County</a> debuted vote centers, which ran smoothly and were overall embraced by voters. The recent switch to vote centers in<a href="https://www.shelbynews.com/news/state/kankakee-valley-students-vote-for-the-first-time/article_34074808-26d3-51e9-8b72-14e7ab6ab9b8.html"> Jasper County</a> made it possible for a Kankakee Valley High government teacher to bring about 40 of his students who are registered to vote to cast their first votes.  At press time,<a href="https://www.thestarpress.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/05/04/indiana-primary-election-results-2022-voter-turnout-voting-machines-count/7420098001/"> Delaware County</a> is the only county that seemed to experience any technical problems, which actually stemmed from low turnout. In some precincts some voting machines weren’t used and poll workers, knowing they hadn’t been used, failed to close them properly and the machines had to be properly shut down when they were returned to the clerk’s office. It added about three hours of work. Further East on Interstate 70, Ohioans headed to the polls in their first of two primaries this year.<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/05/scanning-problems-at-cuyahoga-county-polling-locations-causing-voting-delays-on-election-day.html"> Cuyahoga County</a> experienced issues with its e-pollbooks early on Tuesday, but no voters were turned away. In<a href="https://www.wtol.com/article/news/live_breaking/lucas-county-primary-voting-is-met-with-poll-mix-up/512-dcd70c18-5b78-4bfb-b036-6050304f9ea0"> Lucas County</a>, some voters early Tuesday morning were given the wrong ballots. In<a href="https://www.13abc.com/2022/05/03/ballot-issues-lucas-county-primary-election-day/"> Williams County</a>, the board of elections said it experienced problems providing voters with the right ballots at all polling locations which led to some short delays. Election results were delayed in<a href="https://www.marysvillejt.com/news/trouble-with-northern-ballots-slows-election-night-count/"> Union County</a> after a voting machine at one polling place wasn’t properly closed down and 1,100 ballots had to be scanned at the clerk’s office. Weather definitely played a role in Tuesday’s primary. In<a href="https://thecourier.com/news/384995/voters-sheltered-in-polling-places/"> Hancock County</a>, voters and poll workers had to temporarily seek shelter in the basement of a polling place with a tornado nearby. Power outages from storms forced some polling places in<a href="https://www.recordherald.com/news/74657/strong-storms-cause-damage"> Fayette County</a> to rely on generators. A blown transformer was the cause of power outages in<a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/miami-county-elections-board-scrambles-after-power-outage/MIN5PLSIWBARPJQWYW2V6TIF2I/"> Miami County</a>. And finally, incumbent<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-ohio-donald-trump-election-2020-ab6926aeca146ab15863ce78642bc622"> Secretary of State</a> Frank LaRose (R) will face Democrat Chelsea Clark in the November general election.</p>

In December 2021, the EAC reached out to GAO to determine whether states may use certain grant funds made available to them under HAVA to provide “physical security services and social media threat monitoring” in connection with election activities. GAO stated in its decision that “if not otherwise specified in the law, an expense is authorized where it bears a reasonable, logical relationship to the purpose of the appropriation to be charged.” “Here, a decision to allow the use of grant funds for the physical security services and social media threat monitoring would be within EAC’s legitimate range of discretion,” the report says. “Congress vested in EAC the authority to administer the HAVA grants [but] also vested in EAC the authority to determine whether a particular grant expenditure helps ‘improv[e] the administration of elections for Federal office.’”</p>

Dowling has served as Sac County Auditor for more than 40 years, making him the longest serving current county auditor in the state and one of the longest serving auditors in Iowa history. “I want to thank Auditor Dowling for his many years of public service and dedication to Sac County and the State of Iowa,” Pate said. “Serving as the county commissioner of elections for more than 40 years, he has helped us ensure a clean, fair process for voters. Jim is more than deserving of this honor.&#8221;  Dowling was appointed Sac County Auditor on August 5, 1981. Prior to that, he worked for the Sac County Secondary Roads Department, starting in 1976.  “Well, first of all it comes as a big surprise,” Dowling said. “I didn’t expect anything like this. Looking back, I can say the last 40 years went by in a big hurry. We’ve enjoyed it. I’ve learned a lot and met a lot of good people, and I appreciate this very much.”</p>

The county held its first-ever sticker design contest and Ashwara Pillai, a junior at the University of Texas at Austin won first place. Pillai’s sticker features a famous Texas bluebonnet in the shape of a checkmark. The winning sticker will be distributed to voters at all early voting and Election Day locations for the Nov. 8 election.  The panel that selected the winners included three judges: Dawn Okoro, a multidisciplinary artist; Jose Luigi, an education associate at the Mexic-Arte Museum; and Laura Odegaard, cultural investment program manager with the City of Austin&#8217;s Economic Development Department.  This was the county&#8217;s inaugural &#8220;I Voted&#8221; sticker design contest. Contestants had to include the phrase &#8220;I Voted&#8221; and the theme was voting and elections in Texas or Travis County.  It was open to all students attending college in the county. Judges picked the winners based on the theme, uniqueness and artistry.  &#8220;The Travis County Elections Department was excited to engage college students in the electoral process. Thank you to every student who submitted a design. We look forward to continuing engagement and holding another contest in the future,” the county clerk&#8217;s office said in a release.</p>

Since Early Voting’s second-place finish to Mo Donegal in the April 9 Wood Memorial at Aqueduct, Brown had said, due to Early Voting’s lack of experience, he was leaning toward waiting for the Preakness, but he reserved the right to change his mind if the complexion of the Derby field changed significantly. After virtually all of the contenders put in their final workouts in Kentucky, Florida and California over the weekend without incident, Brown withdrew Early Voting from consideration. Brown said while Early Voting has made just one less start than his other Derby contender, Zandon, he doesn’t have the experience of that horse. Guess we&#8217;ll need to find something else to do at 6:57pm on Saturday. Black-eyed Susans are prettier than roses anyway! 😉</p>

Easterly added that she’s also concerned about other types of threats, including potential insider threats and physical threats on both election officials and building facilities. “There’s nothing more important for the democracy we live in for Americans to have that sense of confidence,” Easterly added.</p>

During a Public Services &amp; Infrastructure (PSI) meeting, city council members discussed a draft ordinance to change the city’s municipal election cycle. The potential charter amendment referendum<a href="https://stpetecatalyst.com/st-pete-continues-to-explore-avenues-for-early-voting/"> follows a letter</a> sent by the Pinellas Supervisor of Elections Office (SOE) late last year affirming the SOE’s authority to decline the city’s request to provide an early voting option for its municipal elections. “By shifting the election schedule from 2023 to 2024 – that would open up a six-month window in which a person who found themselves drawn out of a district for which they wanted to run could move into that district and reestablish residency in time,” he said. “The ordinance is not a permanent solution, nor does it address all of the issues coming out of redistricting.” Despite those challenges, the idea of increasing voter turnout while also saving money outweighed any trepidation.</p>

Gretchen Whitmer<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/29/whitmer-vetoes-bill-change-voter-registration-application/9592055002/"> vetoed a bill</a> that would have changed Michigan&#8217;s voter registration form to require applicants to attest that they understand it is illegal to attempt to vote more than once in the same election. The bill would have specifically required adding a statement to the voter registration form for the applicant to acknowledge &#8220;that it is a felony to offer to vote or attempt to vote more than once at the same election in the same or another voting precinct.&#8221; &#8220;Every citizen of Michigan has a constitutionally guaranteed right to vote and should be free to exercise this right without obstruction,&#8221; Whitmer wrote in her veto letter. She said the legislation &#8220;is part of a larger package of election bills that were not negotiated and aim to restrict or chill access to the ballot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whitmer has also signed an<a href="https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/michigan/governor-whitmer-signs-executive-directive-to-boost-voter-registration-in-michigan"> executive directive</a> to boost voter registration in Michigan. The directive instructs all state departments and agencies to identify and assess potential opportunities to help eligible Michiganders register to vote. It also instructs the departments and agencies to help people in Michigan gain access to reliable information about voting. This includes displays in public spaces, printed materials, online information, public announcements, and social media posts. State departments and agencies will also have to consider which of their offices could help register voters by distributing vote by mail applications, helping people in Michigan complete voter registration forms, and accepting voter registration applications.</p>

Bob Onder (R-Lake St. Louis) to<a href="https://www.house.mo.gov/bill.aspx?bill=HB1606&amp;year=2022&amp;code=R"> House Bill 1606</a>. It would restrict county clerks and boards of election commissioners from taking or accepting &#8220;funding, grants or gifts of any kind from any source other than from the governing board of a political subdivision, the state of Missouri or the federal government.&#8221;<a href="https://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills221/hlrbillspdf/4468H.03P.pdf"> House Bill 2140</a>, which contains similar language banning the accepting or spending of private money &#8220;for preparing, administering or conducting an election including registering voters&#8221; passed the House and was sent to the Senate.</p>
<p>The House approved House Joint Resolution 131 that<a href="https://news.ballotpedia.org/2022/04/29/missouri-house-passes-resolution-related-to-election-administration/"> proposes to modify the state constitution</a> as follows: Providing that “only citizens of the United States” may vote in elections for which they are eligible (existing language specifies that “all citizens of the United States” may vote in elections for which they are eligible).  Providing that voters “shall have only a single vote for each office or issue for which such voter is eligible to vote,” thereby barring the use of ranked-choice voting and other alternative voting systems. Requiring that all voting machines “shall be tested and certified as secure prior to each election.” Requiring that all voting machines must provide “an individual, permanent paper record for each vote cast,” which must be preserved for use in any election audit.  The House approved HJR 131 with a 97-45 vote largely along party lines. The bill is now pending in the Missouri Senate, where it has been referred to the Local Government and Elections Committee. If the proposed amendment is approved by both chambers of the state legislature, it will go to the voters for final approval in November. A simple majority vote is required to amend the state constitution.</p>
<p>By a 96-47 vote, the House has voted again to require<a href="https://www.joplinglobe.com/news/four-states/missouri-house-tries-again-to-require-photo-id-to-vote/article_bd399ac0-1b87-5f4f-a4f3-6fe957347f96.html"> photo identification</a> at the polls. The proposal advanced last week allows voters to cast provisional ballots if they don’t provide valid photo identification. Missouri voters in 2016 amended the Constitution to allow lawmakers to require photo identification to vote. But the Missouri Supreme Court in 2020 permanently blocked a central provision of the 2016 law that required voters who lacked a photo ID to make a sworn statement in order to cast a regular, nonprovisional ballot.</p>

The ordinance aligns the town elections with the November elections of odd-numbered years and will see all councilmembers’ and the mayor’s terms cut short by nine weeks. The ordinance was moved up on the agenda at the beginning of the meeting, as many of the public comments submitted were regarding the possible adoption of the act. Every one of the 10 people who spoke or submitted a comment said they were in favor. In the March election, Town Clerk Francella Garcia said the town spent “almost $23,000.” She also noted the additional costs to the town. “It involved other departments than the clerk’s office,” she said, referencing the IT department, the facilities department, human resources, the GIS analyst along with legal and finance help. Taos County Clerk Anna Martinez, who will now run the elections for the town, said it would help to streamline the election process, as in Red River, which adopted the act in January of 2019. “It’s nice to combine it all into one,” she said.</p>

Mike Schlossberg, Peter Schweyer and Jeanne McNeill, all Democrats, say they plan to introduce legislation that makes it legal for spouses and blood relatives to deliver absentee or mail-in ballots for family members. “I don’t think anyone can stay with a straight face that there is any voter fraud of anything ridiculous going on,” Schlossberg told WLVR. “It’s just a husband and wife doing what they have done for years or for decades — doing errands like picking up the groceries or picking up a prescription at the drug store.” The lawmakers did not elaborate on when they expected a bill to be introduced. They said language is being drafted now.</p>

According to the Associated Press, Napper seemed skeptical of Brnovich’s arguments, but did agree with Brnovich that at least some rules Hobbs included in the Election Procedures Manual she drafted last year were not legal.  The judge said he wants a valid document in place soon. He seemed confounded, however, at many of the wholesale deletions Brnovich demanded, saying the attorney general gave no explanation for much of them and at least some seem to follow the law. “I need some explanation of why you think certain, all of it, specifics, why you think it should be out,” he told attorneys for Brnovich. Napper sided with Brnovich on a rule that allowed unmonitored ballot drop boxes, saying that seemed clearly outside of what the law required. But he said the attorney general’s demand that Hobbs provide a whole new section that outlines how signatures are verified didn’t pass muster. “The manual tracks the statute almost verbatim,” Napper said. “What I need from the attorney general first (is) why each of these provisions needs to be struck. That’s the starting point,” Napper said. “Some of the things that you say need to be struck, as I sit here right now I don’t see why they need to be struck.”</p>

Kramer has ordered a county clerk who<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/05/02/judge-orders-elbert-county-clerk-turn-over-voting-hard-drives/"> copied his voting system’s hard drives</a> to turn over his copies to Colorado’s secretary of state this week. Secretary of State Jena Griswold sued to force Elbert County Clerk Dallas Schroeder to turn over the external hard drives containing the copies and Kramer ruled late last week that Schroeder must follow her lawful orders. Kramer also ordered Schroeder to answer Griswold’s questions about who has had access to the copies in filings. Schroeder has said he copied the hard drives because he wanted to preserve the results of the 2020 election. He first made a copy of the hard drives of the election server, the image cast central computers and the adjudication computer before the state updated voting software. He then made a copy of that set of copies. During a hearing before the judge issued his order, an attorney for Schroder urged Kramer not to allow both copies to be in the same place at the same time in case some disaster like a fire might destroy them. He also asked that Griswold return them to Schroeder after looking at them. Kramer’s order did not address those concerns.</p>
<p>Mesa County District Judge Valerie Robinson issued two orders on Monday in the ongoing legal fight with<a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/robison-tosses-peters-counterclaims/article_ea844c92-cb0c-11ec-bdd8-83265ad03766.html"> Mesa County Clerk</a> Tina Peters. In two orders issued by Robison late Monday, the judge granted a motion filed by the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office to dismiss those counterclaims, and then denied a change-of-venue motion from Peters’ attorneys to move the case to the Front Range. In one of the orders, Robison wrote that Peters’ counterclaims to a lawsuit filed against her to permanently remove her as the county’s designated election official, by law, must be filed directly to Denver District Court. “When a county clerk seeks review of a secretary of state’s final actions, there are no other Colorado statutes that give a court jurisdiction, other than to Denver District Court,” Robison wrote. “Therefore, the court determines that it does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the respondents’ counterclaims against the petitioners.” Robison wrote that if Peters wants a Denver judge to hear her claims, she will have to file a lawsuit directly with that court.</p>

In the fall, the State Election Board<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-election-rule-eliminates-easy-online-absentee-application/ECFKJQX6FJABPH6ZF6TRHBLY6M/"> approved rules</a> that require voters to print out absentee ballot application forms, sign them by hand and return them. In 2020, voters were able to apply for ballots online without filling out paper forms. Three groups filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, saying the new “wet signature” requirement violates provisions of the Civil Rights Act that prohibit election officials from denying people the right to vote because of minor errors in an application. In announcing the lawsuit, the groups said the new signature requirement “unfairly limits ballot access for those who do not have the resources, like printers, to complete applications under the new restrictions.”</p>
<p>Judges on the Georgia<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-appeals-court-is-asked-to-revive-case-questioning-2020-election/5U2LYKAYBNAYVB462327MT4NNA/"> Court of Appeals</a> questioned why they should allow a lawsuit alleging fraud in the 2020 election to continue after a lower court threw out the case. The appellate court hearing was the latest attempt by several voters to inspect paper absentee ballots in Fulton County so they can search for alleged counterfeit votes. Election investigators conducted their own review that couldn’t find any illegitimate ballots. “You’re alleging &#8230; that there are various discrepancies that caused some suspicion, at least in the minds of the plaintiffs, that there might have been some misconduct. But there’s no evidence that that’s actually occurred, right?” Presiding Judge Christopher McFadden said during the 30-minute oral argument. A superior court judge dismissed the case in the fall based on the legal principle of standing, finding that plaintiffs hadn’t suffered a specific injury that would give them a right to sue. On appeal, the plaintiffs say their votes would have been illegally diluted if there were counterfeit ballots. Defense attorney Don Samuel asked the appeals court to uphold the lower court’s ruling because the plaintiffs have failed to show they suffered any individual harm.</p>

Plaintiffs – including the Montana Democratic Party, tribal advocates and youth-voting groups – challenged the laws as unconstitutional restrictions on voting. They specifically argued the requirements would disproportionately affect Native Americans and young voters. In April, District Court Judge Michael Moses of Billings granted their request for a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of those laws until a final ruling on their constitutionality. Moses said his order would prevent possible “constitutional injury” to affected while the case is litigated.  Jacobsen’s office said in their request for a stay that election officials across the state have already been trained on the new laws, and they have been doing outreach to voters explaining the new requirements. They noted that municipal elections were successfully conducted last year with the laws in place, and they argued allowing a change so close to an election would create unnecessary confusion.</p>

Specifically, they want provisions that would allow election observers in both counties to “visually inspect each ballot,” stand within 2 feet of any ballot-counting system and demand the counting process be stopped, if an observer affiliated with any political party has an issue they cannot resolve. Plaintiffs in both cases, who are represented by Adam Fulton from the Las Vegas-based Jennings &amp; Fulton law firm, made identical claims — referencing alleged election misconduct and fraud during the 2020 election and arguing that observers in the state’s two most populous counties were denied “‘meaningful observation’ of the ballot counting process” in 2020. They argued that observers were placed too far to see the counting process, that ballot boxes were moved without giving observers the chance to review the ballots and that observers could see technological issues occur with the counting process but were provided no opportunity to understand those issues. With those obstacles in mind, they argued that “being ‘in the same room’ as the ballot processing operations does not equate to ‘meaningful observation’ as required by law.”</p>

The state attorneys wrote in the filing that Goldman has refused to offer evidence that he voted in the last election, which they argue he must do to prove that his right to vote was injured.  Goldman filed a brief calling for the state’s Department of Elections to provide the evidence and to share which state delegate represents him. Susan Beals, Virginia’s new elections commissioner, claims in a declaration attached to the motion to dismiss that she is unaware if Goldman voted in last year’s elections.</p>

The lawsuit alleges the law, which went into effect last year, is inconvenient and unnecessary. “(The voter ID law) trammels the constitutional right essential to suffrage both in passage and operation,” the suit states. The law, which requires voters to show ID at the polls, was passed in the 2021 legislative session and has been in effect for less than a year. “This is not the last century,” the lawsuit read. “The government needs to show why the first acceptable photo ID cannot display automatically to the poll workers when people vote, so voters can be welcomed and thanked for voting—rather than challenged.” The law was enacted via House Bill 75, whose prime sponsor was Casper Rep. Chuck Gray. Notably, 40 members of the House of Representatives and half of the 30-member Wyoming Senate signed on as co-sponsors.</p>
