							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election officials on guard for ballot errors</strong><br />
<em>Vigorous ballot proofing and public L&amp;A testing are critical to combat MDM</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Summer is cooling off and the election production calendar is heating up.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3343" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ballot.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />At E-82, roughly 11 weeks out from the election, ballot layout, proofing, and logic and accuracy testing is front of mind.<a href="https://www.fvap.gov/info/laws/uocava">  UOCAVA</a> ballots must be delivered next month &#8211; the first major statutory deadline driving production.</p>
<p>Ballot errors have popped up with greater frequency this year and election officials are wary of errors. Innocent, correctable mistakes are being used to thread together damaging narratives about our democracy.</p>
<p>Election officials are steadying themselves to weather a perfect storm.</p>
<p>Even ignoring the new communications priorities necessary since 2020, they are managing once a decade redistricting challenges with particularly late changing and volatile maps this year; crippling FOIA compliance duties; a less experienced workforce with many more novices filling the ranks due to turnover and burnout; a fear of threats and intimidation; and to top it all off &#8211; a global paper shortage rendering ballot errors all the more dangerous.<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/electionofficials/SupplyChain/SCC_BP_SCRM_Paper_Final.pdf"> </a></p>
<p>“Don’t dismiss the severity of supply chain issues for this election cycle. Paper is in short supply for ballots, envelopes, mailings, and forms, so there is no margin for error. With paper stock being low, simply correcting errors and reprinting will not be as easy as it once was. In addition to ballot stock and envelopes, statutory changes made to registration forms, envelopes, and other materials that election officials typically have on hand may need to be reprinted,” said Lori Augino, executive director of the<a href="https://voteathome.org/"> National Vote at Home Institute</a>.</p>
<p>Building ballots and putting them into voters hands is a monumental undertaking &#8211; requiring perfection at each of these foundational steps:</p>
<p><strong>Ballot Styles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure all precinct, political, and taxing district boundaries and maps are correct and voters are correctly coded</li>
<li>Activate all districts participating in a given election</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ballot Production</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collect contest, candidate and public question data &#8211; in multiple languages</li>
<li>Compile all data sets into an election management system</li>
<li>Design and produce ballot images</li>
<li>Print ballots</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Voting Equipment Preparation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Test the logic and accuracy of the voting and tabulation equipment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Go Live</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get the right ballots to the right voters</li>
<li>Get equipment to the right places</li>
</ul>
<p>During all stages, relying on these key principles will support the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use strong record-keeping practices</li>
<li>Rely on primary source documents</li>
<li>Communicate with all stakeholders – including candidates, other jurisdictions, and vested community groups (such as those with members who speak a second language and disability groups)</li>
<li>Getting it right is more important than being fast</li>
<li>Spread the risk – have multiple quality checks in the process and provide proofers that can look with fresh eyes.</li>
<li>Manage version control</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6312" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ELEC_Voting-Booth-Line-1536x1021-1.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Redistricting can add additional opportunities for error, so it’s important to double-check districts, especially the edges of those boundaries before you print.</p>
<p>“So we encourage you to do your due diligence on the front end and proof, proof, and proof some more,” Aguino said. “This is also a critical time for you to meet with postal representatives. Keeping lines of communication open with your vendors and USPS partners is crucial.”</p>
<p>Mistakes and typos can and do happen [Ahem, we totally get that] which is why careful proofing of ballots is critical, the more eyes on something, the better. This is especially important because of current shortages, getting ballots/envelopes/forms reprinted may be next to impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;When mistakes occur, election officials should work to quickly remedy the situation, learn from the experience, and adjust procedures to prevent the same mistakes from occurring again in the future,&#8221; said Tom Hicks, chair of the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>. &#8220;Communication and transparency are critical in elections. Properly communicating errors with the public will help election officials more quickly mitigate logistical issues while also providing voters with the information they need to successfully participate in the election.&#8221;</p>
<p>Proper communication is also key with regard to Logic &amp; Accuracy Testing. Elections officials have “always” provided public testing of voting equipment prior to elections, and while the local media has occasionally stopped by, it’s only been more recently that the interest of the public has really been piqued. Additionally, more media has started to make these tests “must see” reporting.</p>
<p>Of course, even when the equipment is tested and proven to be accurate, some skeptics remain. Such was the case recently in <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2022/07/21/park-county-voting-machines-pass-test-skeptics-remain-unconvinced/">Park County, Wyoming</a>.</p>
<p>Election officials should prepare a communication plan prior to each election. While these efforts take time and resources, an effective communications strategy will save voters and election officials time during critical points in the election cycle.</p>
<p>Traditional news media plays a vital role in informing the public, explaining the process, and reporting developments before, during, and after Election Day. Building relationships with print, radio, television, and online journalists can help election officials communicate with the broader community.</p>
<p>The road ahead is daunting for election officials on all fronts.  Hopefully this article can help in some small way. Hopefully, the primary elections surfaced most issues and production of the general election ballot should start from a more stable foundation.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Helpful Resources</span></strong></p>
<p>The EAC, CISA, and a variety of other NGO’s have raised the alarm and published resources that can help election officials with this first order priority.  Below is a list of valuable resources to support the field during this critical time period:</p>
<p><strong>Ballot Styles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review the National States Geographic Information Council’s (NSGIC)<a href="https://nsgic.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/GEE/Best_Practice_Detail_D.pdf"> Best Practices for Geo-Enabling Elections</a>.</li>
<li>The Center for Technology and Civic Life, working with the NSGIC, created a<a href="https://elections.nsgic.org/just-released-ctcl-and-nsgic-geo-enabled-elections-courses-now-available-on-demand-learn-to-use-gis-to-boost-election-accuracy-limit-risk/"> self-paced online training</a> detailing how to implement and use geographic information systems (GIS) to ensure accuracy and reliability of data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ballot Production</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Center for Civic Design published a field guide on<a href="https://civicdesign.org/fieldguides/"> Designing usable ballots</a></li>
<li>The Elections Group published guides on both<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/ballot-proofing"> Ballot Production (proofing)</a> which should be helpful to the novice election officials or supporting agencies in understanding the fundamentals of the task sets &#8211; but they also include checklists that could be valuable to even more experienced operations.</li>
<li>The EAC distributed information on<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/electionofficials/SupplyChain/SCC_BP_SCRM_Paper_Final.pdf"> paper supply chain issues</a>.</li>
<li>The Sector Coordinating Council and the Government Coordinating Council working with CISA published this on <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/supply-chain-risks-to-election-infrastructure_508.pdf">paper supply chain issues</a>.</li>
<li>Each vendor supplies supporting material for ballot production and should be relied upon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Voting Equipment Preparation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Elections Group published a <a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/logic-and-accuracy-testing">guide on Logic and Accuracy</a>, <strong>(new today 8/18)</strong> including important checklists to be helpful to the novice election officials or supporting agencies in understanding the fundamentals of the task sets &#8211; but they also include checklists that could be valuable to even more experienced operations.</li>
<li>The EAC has recently updated its<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/quick-start-guides"> Quick Start Guides series</a>, which includes 26 guides with helpful tips and practices to assist state and local election officials in effectively managing and administering elections. Included in this series are guides on<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/electionofficials/QuickStartGuides/Logic_and_Accuracy_Testing_EAC_Quick_Start_Guide_508.pdf"> Logic &amp; Accuracy Testing</a>, <a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/electionofficials/QuickStartGuides/Voter_Education_EAC_Quick_Start_Guide_508.pdf">Voter Education</a>,<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/electionofficials/QuickStartGuides/Media_PR_EAC_Quick_Start_Guide_508.pdf"> Media and Public Relations</a>, and <a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/electionofficials/QuickStartGuides/Poll_Watchers_EAC_Quick_Start_Guide_508.pdf">Poll Watchers</a>. Some practical tips include providing observers with written procedures, including key staff and a description of each person’s role in the process, so watchers can understand what they are observing. In addition, key staff members can be designated as points of contact to answer any questions or concerns that arise from observers during the testing. Election officials can also explain how ballots and materials are secured throughout the process.</li>
<li>Each vendor supplies supporting material for Logic &amp; Accuracy Testing and should be relied upon.</li>

<p><strong>Additional Resources<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contingency Planning: For more information about developing contingency plans for a variety of emergencies, election officials can visit the EAC’s dedicated planning webpage that includes information from the EAC, contingency planning working groups, and state and local election officials:<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/contingency-planning"> https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/contingency-planning</a></li>
<li>Election Security: To increase confidence in the security of elections, election officials can prepare information to share with the public about the ways in which they secure voting systems in their jurisdictions. Common best practices include using locks, tamper-evident seals, security cameras, system testing before and after elections, audits, and physical and cybersecurity access controls. The EAC has prepared a guide that outlines some of the many best practices election officials use to secure voting systems, which can assist election officials with communicating these measures with the public:<a href="https://www.eac.gov/voters/election-security"> https://www.eac.gov/voters/election-security</a>.</li>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Three more states complete primaries</strong><br />
<em>Permanent vote by mail and ranked choice make headlines</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Voters in Alaska, Hawaii (Saturday) and Wyoming completed their 2022 primary voting this week and in Alaska and Hawaii, the voting systems were as much a part of the news as who was on the ballot.</p>
<p>Following this week’s primaries we’re down to less than 10 primaries to go till the 2022 primary season is finally over an all eyes turn to November. Until then, here’s a look at how things went in all three states.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5648" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AK-Welcome-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AK-Welcome-300x203.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AK-Welcome-768x518.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AK-Welcome.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Alaska</strong>: The Last Frontier held both its primary and a special election this week and the big news was the roll out of <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/08/17/ranked-choice-voting-in-first-test-in-alaska-is-already-under-attack/">ranked choice voting</a>.<a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/08/16/final-u-s-house-results-wont-be-available-until-aug-31-as-officials-wait-for-overseas-votes/"> Results</a> of the ranked choice races won’t be known until at least August 31 because officials will wait until all military &amp; overseas ballots have arrived before using the system. A lot of effort did go in ahead of time to not only explain the new ranking system, but also explain the ballot-counting process and timeframe for results. In<a href="https://www.kdll.org/local-news/2022-08-16/poll-workers-handle-adjustment-to-ranked-choice-on-double-election-day"> Kenai</a> poll worker Taylor Galley said polls were steadily busy all day. “It’s been exciting. We’ve seen a lot of return voters. A lot of new voters. A couple people have told us it’s their first time voting, which is very exciting,” Galley said. Galley told KDLL poll workers heard mixed opinions about ranked choice. “We’ve heard both ends of the spectrum. Some people like it, some people definitely have not liked it,” she said. “And a lot of people have been frustrated by it, trying to understand how to use it during the votes.” A poll worker in<a href="https://www.kodiakdailymirror.com/news/article_625e62d4-1dc4-11ed-92f3-5b1d775f5c4f.html"> Kodiak</a> said even though most voters said they were familiar with the new system, there were still a lot of spoiled ballots. Poll workers across the City and Borough of<a href="https://www.ktoo.org/2022/08/16/alaska-election-juneau-voters-experience-ranked-choice-voting/"> Juneau</a> said they felt prepared to help voters navigate both ranked choice voting and the open primary on the other side of the ballot.  In<a href="https://www.newsminer.com/election2022/some-fairbanks-voters-redirected-to-different-polling-places/article_ae75b306-1dc5-11ed-805b-271b8fd22b74.html"> Fairbanks</a>, it was ranked choice that was confusing some voters it was redistricting and a reduction of polling places from 12 to seven that caused some angst on Tuesday. The U.S.<a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2022/08/16/justice-department-watching-alaska-election-for-language-and-disability-compliance/"> Department of Justice</a> monitored Tuesday’s primary to ensure compliance with the Sec. 203 of the Voting Rights Act and The Americans with Disabilities Act.  The monitoring is underway in certain jurisdictions, the department said: Anchorage, Juneau and the Bethel, Dillingham and Kusilvak census areas. The department has already been monitoring early and absentee voting in various parts of the state: Anchorage, Juneau, the Kenai Peninsula, the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the Denali Borough, the Fairbanks North Star Borough and the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area. Tiffany Montemayor, public relations manager for the Alaska Division of Elections, said the Department of Justice had notified the division about its plans to be in the state.</p>

In<a href="https://www.khon2.com/local-news/mail-in-voting-popular-but-many-still-prefer-voting-in-person/"> Honolulu</a>, City Clerk Glen Taskahashi told KHON that about 190,000 voters had returned their ballots by mail by Saturday’s primary, and that there was a steady flow of voters dropping ballots off all day. “It’s been a nice, consistent flow of voters and cars of people dropping off their ballots,” Takahashi said. “This is the first time we did a midterm in the vote by mail scheme so we seem to be handling the traffic, flow of voters,” Takahashi said. “So that tells me people like the vote by mail process,” Takahashi explained. “About 10 percent to 15 percent are coming in the drop boxes.” The Senate Chamber at the State Capitol served as the counting center for Honolulu and it was from there that the state&#8217;s Chief Election Officer Scott Nago said there were small delays. &#8220;<a href="https://www.kitv.com/news/elections-official-says-primary-election-night-ran-fairly-smoothly/article_281bbeec-1bb6-11ed-b75f-838451bbf139.html">Every election has hiccups</a>, it&#8217;s a matter of how you deal with it, like the line situation at the Maui Voter Service Center, or making sure we got equipment in on time,&#8221; he notes, adding most of the problems were issues voters wouldn&#8217;t necessarily see. This is first year the state is going with its new scanning machine vendor, Hart Intercivic. &#8220;So far so good,&#8221; notes Nago, who says the machines processed the ballots quickly. &#8220;I&#8217;m happy with it.&#8221; Late processing of ballots collected from drop boxes on<a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/08/influx-of-drop-box-ballots-holds-up-final-elections-results/"> Oahu</a> was holding up the release of final statewide elections results on Sunday afternoon.  Lines started forming at the voter service center in Wailuku on<a href="https://www.mauinews.com/news/local-news/2022/08/turnout-in-maui-county-lowest-in-the-state-at-25-percent/"> Maui</a> early on the morning of Election Day.  “The line started forming at 6:40 a.m. It’s been a busy day,” Deputy County Clerk James Krueger said shortly after 7 p.m. as he waited for the final people in line at the Velma McWayne Santos Community Center to cast their votes. “We had some voters who weren’t happy with our process. But since then, we worked on implementing a<a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2022/08/16/many-maui-residents-frustrated-with-in-person-voting-process/"> different process</a> to help people get in and vote and be on their way for the day,” Krueger said. Despite the lines at the service center, Maui had the lowest turnout in the state. Elections officials are now working to cure mail ballots that had issues. Honolulu needs to cure 3700 ballots, and they&#8217;re not the only ones. Kauai says they&#8217;ve got 81 voters who need cured ballots. The Island of Hawaii has 1041 ballots and in Maui County 849 ballots need the same process. While overall<a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2022/08/15/hawaii-has-over-850k-registered-voters-barely-35-them-actually-voted/"> turnout</a> was down from 2020, it was up from the 2018 midterm.  “Hawaii had such extraordinary voter turnout in 2020. It was never going to be like that in this election because midterms are always lower. But I had hoped it was going to be a little bit higher,” Political Analyst Colin Moore said.</p>

I don&#8217;t look at it as a job. I think that we&#8217;re blessed to be able to do this. I&#8217;m somewhat interested in politics but, more than anything, it&#8217;s about the fact that we&#8217;re helping people.&#8221; State Rep.

That’s not the case, said Raul Merly who was working with Mattimore. “I never expected to find a happy, nice person on this (he gestured to his right) side of the table.

But it was just Herrera who stepped down, according to Gillespie County Judge Mark Stroeher that the entire staff resigned for similar reasons. He said that the county has “some people who are pretty fanatical and radical about things” and drove out Herrera and the staff. Stroeher said that the job became more difficult than it probably should be “because of some individuals who are continuing to question how they are doing things,” according to the Standard-Radio Post. “Elections are getting so nasty and it’s getting dangerous,” Stroeher said to the Standard-Radio Post. Stroeher told the outlet that he will be contacting the Texas secretary of state for guidance about holding the November elections. “It’s unfortunate because we have candidates that need to be elected, and we have voters who want their voices to be heard by the ballots,” Stroeher said. “I don’t know how we’re going to hold an election when everybody in the election department has resigned.” Herrera told the Standard-Radio Post that she received death threats in 2020 and has been threatened and stalked and called out on social media after the 2020 election. She told the paper that she reached out to the county attorney who suggested she forward the issue to the Fredericksburg Police Department and the county sheriff’s office, which claims never to have received any reports. Donald Trump received 79 percent of the vote in Gillespie County in 2020.</p>

The proposed temporary regulation would require the clerk to submit contingency plans to meet statutory deadlines for hand counts, ensure bipartisan counters and place requirements on counters such as wearing medical gloves and not being allowed to bring in outside pens.  The regulation is expected to go through final passage Aug. 26 and would go into effect Sept. 30.  Mark Wlaschin, the elections deputy with the Secretary of State’s office, said that there is no language preventing counties from switching to hand counting ballots. However, he argued if counties are deciding to make the switch there needs to be a standardized approach for transparency’s sake and to ensure counting is completed in time.  “Until this regulation was proposed, there was no standardized process,” Wlaschin said. “So election officials in all 17 (counties) across our state were expected to, if they were going to conduct a hand count tabulation, make their own process and templates and conduct their own research.” ACLU of Nevada, the Brennan Center for Justice, Silver State Voices and All Voting is Local are asking the office to prohibit hand counting rather than regulating it.</p>

The board unanimously voted to approve temporary rules for the upcoming election that more clearly outline the code of conduct for partisan observers, prohibiting them from standing close to a “tabulator, laptop, pollbook or other voting document” where they could view marked ballots or confidential voter information. The revisions heighten scrutiny for observers and poll workers alike, adding a list of prohibited conduct for precinct officials that forbids them from tampering with voting equipment or expressing their political views on the job. A survey of county elections directors in late May found violations in 15 North Carolina counties, where officials observed poll watchers harassing voters and attempting to enter restricted areas to view confidential voting records. The state board opted to pursue a temporary rule change to ensure the revisions are approved before in-person early voting begins Oct. 20, said Paul Cox, associate legal counsel to the board. “The existing rules just, quite frankly, are not models of clarity,” Cox said. “We want to avoid any disruptive issues going forward, especially given how these incidents seem to have recently surfaced in significant enough numbers to cause our county directors concern.&#8221;</p>

He was 78. According to his family, Culp had long-battled Alzheimer’s. Culp, a Vietnam War veteran and former teacher had a long career in Mecklenburg County government and politics which ended when he was convicted of taking more than 120 bribes in a yearslong voting-machine conspiracy. According to The Charlotte Observer, Culp expanded voting registration across the county and saw himself as a bipartisan source of information for candidates from both parties. Culp served as elections director for 28 years before his sudden retirement in 1998. Culp was indicted on federal corruption and wire fraud charges. According to government prosecutors, Culp had accepted $134,000 in bribes and kickbacks from a voting-machine salesman and repairman over a period of years in return for awarding millions of dollars in county contracts. In one iteration of the scheme, the repairman overbilled the county so Culp would receive a $25 kickback from every machine serviced. After his indictment, Culp blamed his actions on what he said was his addiction to marijuana, which he had begun smoking in Vietnam. Prosecutors dismissed the purported cause-effect as Culp’s maneuvering to be allowed into a prison drug-treatment program that would cut a year off his prison time. He was sentenced to 30 months, served less than half of that time behind bars and spent six months in a Charlotte halfway house. He was released in March 2001.</p>

Commission Chairman Harry Johnston said the board received many requests from the public to change the voting system in Cherokee County, but does not have the power to do it. “We’ve researched it, our attorney has researched it, and we’ve determined that we don’t have that power, while there are some points in the law that might seem to indicate we do, the preponderance of the law clearly says that we do not and so we just can’t do that,” he said. “Furthermore, I’m not sure we really would want to change Cherokee County in a way that would be unique from other counties. My personal belief is that 159 different voting systems across Georgia would not necessarily move us toward greater election integrity, but it might actually move us away from that.” Johnston said as much as he trusts the people who run the elections in the county, he believes it’s better if the state has a unified system. The elimination of the QR code probably won’t satisfy everyone’s concerns, Johnston said, but it would at least remove one concern.</p>

The board also voted to stop using absentee ballot boxes, using a mail slot inside a county building instead. The moves are intended to combat fraud even though post-election audits show 100% accuracy in Carver County vote counting since 2006. In July about 30 activists showed up at the Carver County board meeting to lobby for hand counts, more partisan election judges and elimination of absentee ballot boxes. The League of Women Voters Minnesota lobbied Carver County not to give in to activists’ demands. About a dozen residents spoke during a public hearing before the vote. One asked the county to create an election task force to examine the issues. Several asked that the county electronically capture ballots to allow for forensic analysis and retain last week’s primary election data for future examination. Others claimed county workers aren’t responding to their requests for public data. Sarah Carlson, a member of the League from Chaska, said the right-wing activists were painting county workers as criminals with no evidence. “This is a thankless undertaking in the best of times,” Carlson said. “And these aren’t the best of times.”</p>

The approximate cost of the lawsuit would be around $100,000 according to Otero County Attorney R.B. Nichols. The Commission also voted on a two-to-one margin to uphold a previous vote in favor of a resolution calling for the removal of drop boxes and voting machines, and to hand count ballots.</p>

The bill’s prime sponsor, Rep. Chris Quinn, R-Delaware, said that as Pennsylvania becomes increasingly politically polarized, primary elections more often determine the winners of political races. The result is that unaffiliated voters are unable to participate meaningfully in taxpayer-funded elections, Quinn said during the hearing at Villanova University. The committee hearing on<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=1369"> House Bill 1369</a> is the furthest legislation on open primary elections has advanced, Quinn said. A similar bill passed in the Senate in 2019 but did not advance in the House.  While the bill has bipartisan sponsorship, support for ending closed primary elections was not universal among members of the State Government Committee. Quinn said he’s hopeful the legislation will be considered in the fall.</p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-6136" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DOJ.png" alt="" width="187" height="182" />Election Official Threats</strong>: Walter Lee Hoornstra, 50, of Tecumseh, Missouri has been charged with<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3605550-missouri-man-charged-with-threatening-arizona-election-worker/"> communicating an interstate threat and making a threatening telephone call</a>. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-charged-making-threat-arizona-election-official"> said</a> that according to court documents, Hoornstra allegedly left a threatening voicemail message on the personal cellphone of the Maricopa County election worker in May 2021. Although the DOJ<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/missouri-man-charged-threatening-election-official-arizona-2022-08-17/"> did not identify the victim</a>, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer confirmed that he was the recipient of Hoornstra’s threats.  In the voicemail message to the election worker, Hoornstra allegedly said: “So I see you’re for fair and competent elections, that’s what it says here on your homepage for your recorder position you’re trying to fly here,” according to the DOJ. “But you call things unhinged and insane lies when there’s a forensic audit going on. You need to check yourself. You need to do your [expletive] job right because other people from other states are watching your ass,” Hoornstra allegedly added, according to the department, “You [expletive] renege on this deal or give them any more troubles, your ass will never make it to your next little board meeting.” “The FBI is committed to vigorously investigating and holding accountable anyone who threatens election workers,” said Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. “These public servants protect our fundamental right to vote by administering fair and free elections. Any attempts to interfere with our elections by intimidating election officials, their staffs, and volunteers with threats of violence will not be tolerated.” If convicted, Hoornstra faces up to five years in prison for making a threatening interstate communication and up to two years in prison for making a threatening telephone call.</p>

The motion, filed July 18 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, says an April 22 suit that asks a federal judge to bar the use of tabulation equipment in the 2022 elections is “demonstrably false.” “Plaintiffs’ and their counsels’ use of the Court to further a disinformation campaign and false narrative concerning the integrity of the election process in Arizona by asserting demonstrably false allegations is repugnant,” the motion says. “This improper use of the courts is unacceptable, detrimental to the entire election process, subjects election officials and workers to threatening and harassing conduct, and violates Rule 11.” The county is asking for Lake, Finchem and their lawyers to pay back attorney fees, which are taxpayer-funded, associated with the lawsuit. The Lake/Finchem suit alleges that Arizona voters do not vote by hand on paper ballots, among other claims the county says are false.</p>
<p>The Democratic National Committee and the Arizona Democratic party want a federal judge to strike down another attempt by legislative Republicans to demand<a href="https://fronterasdesk.org/content/1802946/dnc-arizona-democrats-latest-sue-arizona-over-new-voter-id-law"> proof of citizenship from federal-only voters</a>. The lawsuit notes that the U.S. Supreme Court has already rejected a previous attempt by Arizona Republicans to require federal-only voters — those who use a federal voter registration form to vote in federal elections — to undergo the same scrutiny as voters registering with the state of Arizona.  Arizona requires proof of citizenship to vote in Arizona elections.  But in 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that Arizona’s attempt to enforce that standard of federally-registered voters violated the National Voter Registration Act. “Gov. (Doug) Ducey and Arizona Republicans’ blatantly unconstitutional move to restrict eligible Arizona voters’ freedom to vote is unacceptable,” Raquel Terán, chair of the Arizona Democratic Party, said in a statement. “Democrats stand united in fighting this power grab to restrict Arizonans&#8217; voting rights tooth and nail.” HB 2492 also includes restrictions that would prevent federally-registered voters — those registered without providing proof of citizenship – from voting in presidential elections and from voting by mail.</p>
<p>Voting-rights advocates are<a href="https://www.publicnewsservice.org/2022-08-12/civic-engagement/voting-rights-groups-sue-az-to-block-election-security-bills/a80247-1"> suing the state of Arizona</a> over new regulations they say make it harder for some people to register and would block thousands of voters from the polls. The lawsuit targets a pair of &#8220;election security&#8221; bills passed this year by the Republican-controlled Legislature, calling them an attempt to disenfranchise thousands of otherwise eligible voters. The lawsuit alleges that the Arizona measures violate the National Voter Registration Act and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Hostetler said some GOP proponents have talked openly about the purpose of the bills.  The suit asks that a federal judge issue injunctions to prevent House Bills<a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2r/bills/hb2243h.htm"> 2243</a> and<a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2492/id/2561170"> 2492</a> from being enforced.  The suit initially was filed by the Campaign Legal Center, but Free Speech for People and Arizona tribes and other groups have signed on. GOP lawmakers claim the new restrictions will prevent &#8220;widespread fraud&#8221; they believe was part of the 2020 elections, although there is no credible evidence to support their assertion. Courtney Hostetler, an attorney with Free Speech for People said she believes one of the most onerous elements of the bills is the inclusion of criminal penalties for even minor infractions of an election law. She said it&#8217;s designed to intimidate potential voters.</p>

The board voted 4-0 to seek a legal remedy in hopes of speeding up the vote count for mail-in ballots, which have become much more popular with voters in the state.  In a statement after the vote, the board said that the continued expansion of mail-in balloting and the inability of the local boards of elections to count mail-in ballots before Election Day could have significant implications.  “It could leave local, statewide, and even federal contests without certified results until late December 2022 or early January 2023,” the board said. “Maryland is currently the only state in the union that forbids any kind of processing of mail-in ballots until after Election Day.” Currently, mail-in ballots can’t be counted until two days after Election Day. That caused delays in determining winners in the state’s primary last month. The state elections board certified the primary election on Monday. Severn Miller, an elections board member, said the board is restricted in terms of what it has authority to do on its own on the matter. “I think the appropriate avenue here is to seek judicial relief in a circuit court to allow the counting of mail-in ballots before Election Day, so that we can get ahead of the curve and to simply not release those results until after Election Day is completed,” Miller said during a board meeting Monday.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5222" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Minnesota-Flag-300x186.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="186" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Minnesota-Flag-300x186.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Minnesota-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Minnesota</strong>: The Minnesota Court of Appeals has<a href="https://kstp.com/kstp-news/local-news/court-of-appeals-denies-challenge-to-minnesota-absentee-ballot-rule/"> denied a challenge to an absentee ballot rule</a> that explains how those ballots must be accepted or rejected. The Minnesota Voters Alliance argued that<a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/rules/8210.2450/#:~:text=If%20a%20ballot%20is%20received,and%20must%20not%20be%20counted."> Minnesota Rule 8210.2450</a> conflicted with a state statute and doesn’t properly allow ballot board members to consider all evidence — mainly voter signatures — when deciding whether or not an absentee ballot should be accepted. The organization specifically challenged two parts of the rule. The first, subpart No. 2, says the ballot board must reject a ballot on the basis of a signature only “if the name signed is clearly a different name than the name of the voter as printed on the signature envelope,” and adds that the use of or lack of full names, nicknames, abbreviations or initials aren’t a reason for an absentee ballot to be rejected. The second part, subpart No. 3, says board members “must compare the signatures” if voter identification numbers don’t match. However, the Court of Appeals noted that the rule, like state law, only calls for ballot board members to examine the signature on the absentee ballot envelope if the identification number doesn’t match the application. Board members do have to verify the voter’s name and address match on the absentee application and the signature envelope, and the envelope must also be signed in some manner with the signed name matching the voter’s name. The court determined that the rule simply allows “some flexibility in how a voter writes their name on different documents over a span of time” and doesn’t conflict with state law. The court also rejected the notion that signatures not having to match would allow anyone to sign for a voter for any reason, noting that state law only allows another person to sign for a voter under one circumstance: when a voter “is unable to write,” another person can sign the signature envelope on the voter’s behalf in the voter’s presence.</p>

Moses is hearing arguments this week over<a href="https://www.ktvq.com/homepage-showcase/trial-begins-for-controversial-new-voting-laws-heard-by-billings-judge"> three new election laws passed by the Montana Legislature in 2021</a>. There are 11 plaintiffs suing Christi Jacobsen in her official capacity as Montana secretary of state. The plaintiffs include the Montana Democratic Party, Western Native Voice, Montana Youth Action, and an individual, Micah Bohn.  Opening arguments took place Monday morning over the course of an hour. The trial is expected to last two weeks. The question posed to the court is if three laws passed during the 2021 legislative session violate Montanans&#8217; constitutional rights. The three new voting laws originated from House Bill 530, House Bill 176 and Senate Bill 169.  House Bill 530 prevents groups or individuals who collect and turn in ballots from receiving any monetary compensation; House Bill 176 ends Election Day voter registration and Senate Bill 169 re-classifies student ID cards as secondary forms of identification that must be used with another form of ID when voting. The bills immediately drew legal challenges from voting rights groups who say all of these measures make it harder for certain Montanans to vote—especially young voters and Native Americans.</p>

The counties argue the ballots shouldn’t be counted because of the legal requirement for the exterior envelope dates, which are not used to determine if voters are eligible or if the ballots are received in time. Wolf sued Berks, Fayette and Lancaster counties a month ago, seeking a court order to compel them to “certify” the mail-in votes in question. Cohn Jubelirer, an elected Republican jurist, said Friday she “will work very diligently” to issue an opinion. The dispute has stalled certifications of statewide results from the primary in the high-profile races for Pennsylvania governor and U.S. Senate, as well as results for congressional and state legislative contests involving the three counties.</p>

The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe filed the case against the county in May, alleging their<a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/12/federal-judge-issues-injunction-lower-brule-sioux-voting-rights-case/10310460002/"> delaying of implementing a new redistricting</a> plan for the Board of Commissioners violates the 14th and 15th Amendments and the Voting Rights Act. The new plan would allow Native American voters the chance to be represented by two county commissioners on the five-member board, split into two districts. But because of the delay, the November election would be under the current at-large system, diluting the Native American vote, according to the lawsuit. &#8220;Lyman County is a small county and if demographic trends hold it is headed to a point where it could be evenly divided between Native American and non-Native American residents,&#8221; Lange wrote in his 49-page opinion. &#8220;Cooperation between the Tribe and the County, between Tribal members and non-Tribal members, is crucial to the future of Lyman County.&#8221; Lyman County must propose a remedial plan by the end of this week, according to the filing.</p>

Despite the extraordinary efforts of many educators, civic education too often is insufficient and inequitable. We can change that. Join us for a research presentation and panel, co-hosted by CIRCLE and iCivics, on how K-12 schools can play a role in preparing young people for participation in our nation&#8217;s constitutional democracy. The civic education experts at CIRCLE will share major findings and recommendations from the CIRCLE Growing Voters report about teens’ civic learning experiences — or lack thereof — and the role of schools in a paradigm-shifting framework for supporting young people’s civic development. In conversation with educators, students, teacher trainers, and other education leaders, we’ll discuss what these findings mean for multiple stakeholders in the K-12 schools ecosystem and the practical steps they can take to ensure each and every student, especially those from disadvantaged or marginalized communities, receives a high-quality civic education during this school year and into the future. <strong>When:</strong> August 31, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
