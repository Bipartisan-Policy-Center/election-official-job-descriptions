														<p><strong>Election Day 2022: How voters changed voting in 2022</strong><br />
<em>State and local election admin ballot measures alter the process</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p>While the economy weighed heavily on voter’s minds on November 8, according to the Associated Press’ VoteCast,<a href="https://www.realsimple.com/holidays-entertaining/holidays/thanksgiving/thanksgiving-conversation-starters"> 44% of voters <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8343" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />said the future of democracy</a> was their primary consideration when voting this year.</p>
<p>And while that certainly was clear in the choice many voters made for<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2022/11/13/election-deniers-defeated-state-races/"> who will be in charge of elections</a> in their state, it was also clear in many of the state and local elections administration-related ballot measures.</p>
<p>Ranked choice voting was a big winner this year with voters in Nevada, Ojai, California, Fort Collins, Colorado, Evanston, Illinois, Multnomah County, Oregon, Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington all voting to move their state or local systems to ranked choice.</p>
<p>Early voting was a winner with voters in Connecticut agreeing to amend the state constitution to allow for early, in-person voting for the first time, while voters in Michigan enshrined a nine-day early voting period.</p>
<p>Voters were split on voter ID. In Arizona, Proposition 309 that would have changed the ID rules for both mail-in and in-person voting failed whereas voters in Nebraska voted to allow the state Legislature to implement voter photo ID.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at the statewide and local election administration-related ballot measures:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Statewide Measures</strong></span><br />
<strong>Arizona:</strong> Voters in Arizona had several elections-related ballot measures to consider. At press time<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-arizona-phoenix-government-and-politics-0ce1690e02eb851f05e80691162d4290"> Proposition 309</a>, the Voter Identification Requirements for Mail-In Ballots and In-Person Voting Measure appears to have <strong>failed</strong>. Under the measure, voters would have been required to add more information to the signature and date on the return envelope. Additionally, the proposition would have eliminated the ability of registered voters who do not have a state or federally-issued photo ID with them when they vote in-person to provide other proof of identity to cast a ballot.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8591" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PimaCoAZIVoted-300x277.png" alt="" width="300" height="277" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PimaCoAZIVoted-300x277.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PimaCoAZIVoted-768x710.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PimaCoAZIVoted.png 872w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Additionally, there were<a href="https://results.arizona.vote/#/ballotmeasure/33/0"> three proposed restrictions to ballot measures</a> on this year’s ballot: Proposition 128, which would allow the Legislature to amend or repeal ballot measures even after they are <strong>approved</strong> if a judge rules that provisions within them are unconstitutional appears to have failed; Proposition 129, which would limit citizen-initiated ballot measures to a single topic appears to have been <strong>approved</strong>; and Proposition 132, which would require any ballot initiative that would raise taxes to pass by 60 percent also appears to have been <strong>approved</strong>. .</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong><a href="https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/AR/115767/web.307039/#/detail/1600"> Issue 2</a>, which would require 60% approval for all citizen-led ballot initiatives and proposed constitutional amendments to pass has <strong>failed</strong> with 59.14% of the people voting against it. The current standard of  50% plus one vote for approval will remain in place.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Connecticut_Question_1,_Allow_for_Early_Voting_Amendment_(2022)"> Question 1</a>, is the Allow for Early Voting Amendment, which would amend the state’s constitution. The question was <strong>approved</strong> with 60.52% of the vote which is enough under Connecticut law to amend the state’s constitution. The<a href="https://www.ctpublic.org/news/2022-11-16/incoming-state-election-boss-suggests-up-to-5-days-of-early-voting-in-ct-but-lawmakers-must-approve"> details must now be worked</a> out by the state Legislature. The recently approved amendment is already facing its first<a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2022/11/17/connecticut-early-voting-faces-legal-challenge/"> legal challenge</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> With 60% percent of the vote<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Michigan_Proposal_2,_Voting_Policies_in_Constitution_Amendment_(2022)"> Proposal 2</a>, the Voting Policies in Constitution Amendment has been <strong>approved</strong>. A “yes” vote supports adding several election and voting-related policies to the Michigan Constitution, including some policies that exist in statute and others which would be new. As provisions of the Michigan Constitution, legislators would not be able to repeal or amend these policies without first passing a constitutional amendment, which would require voter approval. Proposal 2 would add <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8881" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ColoradoIVotedWinner22-300x266.png" alt="" width="300" height="266" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ColoradoIVotedWinner22-300x266.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ColoradoIVotedWinner22.png 458w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />the following policies to the state constitution: creating a nine-day early voting period; allowing for a signed affidavit or photo identification to vote; requiring that military and overseas ballots postmarked by election day are counted; providing voters with a right to request an absentee ballot; requiring the state to fund prepaid stamps and a tracking system for absentee ballots; requiring the state to fund a number of absentee ballot drop boxes; providing that local governments can accept charitable and in-kind donations to assist with running elections as long as donations are disclosed and aren’t from foreign entities; and providing that election officials are responsible for election audits, requiring election audits to be conducted in public, and requiring election results to be certified based on votes cast. Proposal 2 would also add constitutional language saying that laws, regulations, and practices that interfere with a person’s right to vote are prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> With 65.6% of the vote,<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nebraska_Initiative_432,_Photo_Voter_Identification_Initiative_(2022)"> Ballot Measure 432</a> that will require voters to show a photo ID to cast a future ballot, has been <strong>approved</strong>. It is now up to the state Legislature to work out the details of what types of identification will be permitted.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> With 52.86% of the vote, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Nevada_Question_3,_Top-Five_Ranked_Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2022)">Nevada Question 3</a> was <strong>approved</strong>. The approval of Question 3 will establish open top-five primaries and ranked-choice voting for general elections, which would apply to congressional, gubernatorial, state executive official, and state legislative elections.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8677" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-300x250.png" alt="" width="300" height="250" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-300x250.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-1024x852.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-768x639.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted.png 1158w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Ohio:</strong><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Ohio_Issue_2,_Citizenship_Voting_Requirement_Amendment_(2022)"> Issue 2</a> is the Citizenship Voting Requirement Amendment. A “yes” vote supports prohibiting local governments from allowing noncitizens or those who lack the qualifications of an elector to vote in local elections. The Amendment was <strong>approved</strong> with 77.05% of the vote.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Local Measures</strong></span><br />
<strong>California:</strong> There were elections-related ballot measures up for vote in several California jurisdictions this year. And while local elections officials are still processing and counting ballots, here’s a look at where they stand at press time. In<a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2022/09/26/ballot-measures-san-clemente-could-soon-appoint-rather-than-elect-clerk-and-treasurer/"> San Clemente</a>, with 53.09% of the vote, the city’s clerk, which has oversight of local elections, will now be appointed. In<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oakland,_California,_Measure_S,_Noncitizen_Residents_Voting_Measure_(November_2022)"> Oakland</a>, voters approved Measure S with 62.9% of the vote. Under the measure the city charter would be amended to allow noncitizen residents who are the legally recognized caregiver of a child for the Office of Oakland School Board Director if they are otherwise eligible to vote under state and local law. With 55.74% of the voter, voters in<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Ojai,_California,_Measure_M,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Measure_(November_2022)"> Ojai</a> have approved a measure that will move the city to a ranked choice voting system starting in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> With 63.33% of the vote<a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/09/20/odds-or-evens-boulder-voters-will-decide-which-years-are-best-for-city-council-elections/"> Boulder</a> voters have approved measure 2E, a charter amendment that will move the Regular Municipal Election (council member elections) to even years beginning in 2026. This will shift City Council elections to even-numbered years to be held on the same date as the state general election and will result in council members who are elected in the 2023 and 2025 elections serving three-year terms. The term for the mayor elected in 2023 will increase to three years. Local ballot measures will continue to appear on the ballot on uneven years. In<a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/11/16/fort-collins-early-returns-ranked-choice-voting/"> Fort Collins</a>, about 58% of voters have said yes to Ballot <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8105" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-300x232.png" alt="" width="300" height="232" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-300x232.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-768x593.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted.png 922w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Question 2C that would move the city to a ranked choice voting system. If the numbers hold the initiative win is certified, Fort Collins will be the largest city in the state to use ranked choice.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> With 78.5% of the vote, voters on<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/10-13/"> Kaua’i</a> have decided to amend the county charter to require that future elections for prosecuting attorney occur at the same time as the county’s regularly scheduled elections.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> With 82.21% of the vote,<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Evanston,_Illinois,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Measure_(November_2022)"> Evanston</a> will become the first city in Illinois to use ranked choice voting in municipal elections beginning in April 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> There were several local measures on the ballot in Oregon this year. In<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Portland,_Oregon,_Measure_26-228,_Changes_to_City_Governance_and_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Measure_(November_2022)"> Portland</a>, Measure 26-228 was approved with about 58 percent of the vote. Not only will the measure overall the city’s government structure, but it will also move local elections to a ranked choice voting system. In Multnomah County, voters were split on two elections-related measures. With 66% of the vote, the county will move to a<a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2022/11/08/multnomah-county-voters-approve-ranked-choice-voting/"> ranked choice voting</a> system. A measure that would have allowed<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2022/11/09/multnomah-county-voting-access-noncitizens-citizenship/"> noncitizens</a> to vote in local elections failed after receiving only 45% of the vote.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-8903" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BuncombeCoNCIVoted-300x290.png" alt="" width="224" height="217" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BuncombeCoNCIVoted-300x290.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BuncombeCoNCIVoted.png 362w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" />Washington:</strong> Although votes are still being processed and tallied in Washington, there are results in several local elections-related ballot measures. Voters in<a href="https://salish-current.org/2022/11/09/san-juan-county-midterms-ranked-choice-voting/"> San Juan County</a> appear to have rejected a ballot measure that would have moved the county to a ranked choice voting system for local races. In King County, voters faced several elections-related ballot measures. Charter Amendment No. 1 would allow the county charter to be amended to<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/King_County,_Washington_ballot_measures"> move elections</a> for the county offices of executive, assessor, director of elections and councilmembers from odd-numbered to even-numbered year.<a href="https://info.kingcounty.gov/kcelections/Vote/contests/ballotmeasures.aspx?lang=en-US&amp;cid=100544&amp;groupname=County"> Proposition 1A and 1B</a> gave voters two choices for changing how local elections officials are elected. Choice number was should either measure be enacted and choice number two was which measure. 1A was a preferential voting system and 1B was ranked choice voting system. While still unofficial, voters voted yes (50.91%), to changing how local elections are conducted and then overwhelmingly voted in favor of ranked choice voting (76.68%).</p>

The decision puts Allen at odds with outgoing Secretary of State John Merrill who said the system has helped identify voter fraud. Allen said he heard repeatedly while campaigning across the state during the last 18 months that people did not want their personal information sent to an out-of-state group. “I made a promise that I would withdraw Alabama from ERIC and I am keeping that promise,” Allen said in a press release. “I have informed them, via certified letter, that upon my inauguration on January 16, 2023, Alabama will immediately and permanently cease to transmit any information regarding any citizen in the State of Alabama to their organization and that we will no longer participate in any aspect of the ERIC program.” In a statement responding to Allen’s press release today, Merrill reiterated his position that ERIC provides an important service. “Alabama uses ERIC to preserve a clean and accurate voter list,” Merrill said “We have not experienced one negative issue because of our relationship with ERIC. In fact, ERIC identified 12 confirmed incidents of voter fraud during the 2020 election where citizens voted in both Alabama and another member state. These cases have been turned over to the Attorney General’s Office for investigation. Other member states are currently working with Alabama to identify other incidents of voter fraud. This would not have been possible without our partnership with ERIC.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6229" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-28-at-1.34.29-PM.png" alt="" width="278" height="84" />Preliminary Findings:</strong> The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has released<a href="https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/f/e/530671.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1kzBinUj0fQytIZ2cwfMxmPKlELLBBbivC2vtL2PijYFbi6TvuDGNExPw"> initial findings and conclusions</a> from the 2022 midterm election.  The November 8 mid-term congressional elections were competitive and professionally managed, with active voter participation. However, the noted efforts to undermine voters’ trust in the electoral process by baselessly questioning its integrity can result in systemic challenges. Campaigning was free but highly polarized and marred by harsh rhetoric. In many cases, partisan redistricting resulted in uncompetitive constituencies. Disclosure mechanisms for campaign finance are generally comprehensive, but loopholes in the regulatory framework make the impact of money in politics less transparent. Many in the diverse media landscape made efforts to present accurate information, but polarization and widespread disinformation affected voters’ ability to inform themselves. Election administrators enjoyed general confidence, but the politicization of the offices of chief election officials and the intimidation of election workers are of concern. Restrictions on international observers in some states are at odds with OSCE commitments. The mission includes 17 experts based in Washington, DC and 40 long-term observers deployed throughout the country. On election day, 194 observers from 48 countries were deployed, including 62 observers deployed by ODIHR (the OSCE office that manages election observation missions), as well a 132-member delegation from the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. The OSCE’s full statement will be issued in early 2023.</p>

That makes this the midterm election with the second-highest youth voter turnout in almost three decades. CIRCLE also estimates that youth turnout was even higher in some battleground states. After hovering around 20% turnout in midterm elections since the 1990s, young people shifted that trend in 2018 and largely maintained that trend in 2022, with more than a quarter of young people casting a ballot. Youth are increasing their electoral participation, leading movements, and making their voices heard on key issues that affect their communities. CIRCLE also estimates that, in a group of nine electorally competitive states for which exit poll data is available (FL, GA, MI, NC, NH, NV, OH, PA, WI), the aggregate youth voter turnout was 31%. These are early estimates of youth voter turnout that may shift in the coming days. “Young people proved once again that they’ll turn out to vote and impact election results, and their turnout in 2022 is one of the highest we’ve ever seen in a midterm election,” said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, Newhouse Director of CIRCLE. “In many states youth overcame changes to election laws that posed direct barriers to participation and a lack of strong and continued investment in youth registration. There’s both a big need and extraordinary potential to continue building on this trend of strong youth voting by stepping up our support for all youth to have a voice in our democracy.”</p>

Based on the numbers NVAHI now can see, in 2022 they now expect: Excuse required states to see 4% utilization, at best (mailed-out ballots divided by registered voters); No excuse states to see more than 4x that rate at about 17% utilization; and No excuse states that include SSU to see more than 5x the excuse required rate, at about 21% utilization. Vote at Home’s MOBET information tool relies on official data originating from state and local election officials, some of it compiled by trusted sources including the U.S. Elections Project and Catalist. Some vote-by-mail highlights include Nebraska where the state averaged 52.8% turnout. But the eleven counties that have opted to go to 100% mailed-out ballots averaged 68.3% – a full 15%+ points higher. In Based on their move to no-excuse mailed-out ballot voting, Massachusetts had over 1.2 million mailed-out ballots in 2022, up over 10x from just 105,000 in 2018. It appears when the counting is done, about 80% of those will have been cast. In contrast, polling place voters turnout out is coming in at just over a 40% rate. Wisconsin’s use of mailed-out ballots is up almost 5x from 2018 (168,000 to over 800,000).</p>

The Honolulu City Council will be taking up a similar proposal this month. So far 19 open carry lists have been issued in Hawaii County, but those holding licenses will have a broad list of places where concealed carry is outlawed. That includes voting centers, government buildings, public transportation and places that serve alcohol. The bill will also ban concealed carry at hospitals, schools and daycares unless the licensed gun owner has permission from the facility. “It’s finding that balance, I think my colleagues can agree it’s finding that balance it’s not a broad prohibition. It does give organizers of the event the right to say the condition of the event. Something like drug or alcohol-free event,” Hawaii County Councilmember Heather Kimball said.</p>

State Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon, who chairs the legislative committee that will carry the water on the legislation that will shape the bill said it’s not going to be an easy task. “There’s a lot of different, possible versions of what can come out of this,” Brewer told The Nebraska Examiner. Brewer said he is braced for loud and long debate during the coming legislative session. Brewer said he is bound to a mission: “To make sure nobody is left out, that we allow everyone the privilege of voting.”</p>

With two years before the 2024 presidential election the paper reported, lame duck could prove the time for lawmakers to try to enact voting reforms that would trim the early voting calendar, restrict the use of absentee ballot drop boxes, and possibly mandate photo ID. A Republican-backed bill has been pending in the General Assembly that would, among other things, eliminate in-person early voting on the Monday immediately preceding Election Day and limit the number and operation of drop boxes for absentee ballots. There is also talk of potentially adding a requirement for photo identification for in-person voting, generally opposed by Democrats. Current law provides a menu of acceptable identification but does not mandate a photo ID. The two chambers have both scheduled five session days starting on Wednesday and continuing until Dec. 21. Any legislation not passed and sent to the governor&#8217;s desk by the time the 134th General Assembly is gaveled to a close before the end of the year must start the entire legislative process over next year.</p>

In recent elections, the township volunteer fire department at 477 S. Main Road has hosted a drop box to collect ballots. This week, supervisors considered a resolution submitted by a resident that said the use of drop boxes “has seriously undermined the integrity of our electoral process and continues to erode the public’s trust.” The resolution, which was defeated because it failed to get a majority vote, would have banned drop boxes in Wright Twp. “unless compelled to do so by Pennsylvania statute or by official legal authority.” Supervisors Colleen Macko and Candace Smith voted for the resolution, while supervisors Louis Welebob Jr. and Matthew Howton voted against the measure. Supervisor Chairman Gary Zampetti did not attend the meeting due to an “excused” absence.</p>

The system allows voters to rank their choices on the ballot. The bottom candidates are eliminated until one candidate reaches 50%. Burlington used ranked-choice voting from 2005 to 2009 and then repealed it in 2010. An effort to set up ranked choice voting for presidential primaries fizzled out last year, but this coming session lawmakers say they are going to take a look at it for the presidential primaries. The Vermont Public Interest Research Group supports the reforms that have been implemented in several states for federal elections, including Maine and Alaska. “And that’s a mix of red and blue states. It’s not about one party or anything like that, so I’m hoping that we will find some good support for that,” said VPRIG’s Paul Burns. Vermont Secretary of State-elect Sarah Copeland Hanzas has said she supports the system for presidential primaries but Governor Phil Scott says he’s opposed.</p>

State Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, and state Rep. Valoree Swanson, R- Spring, filed companion bills in their respective chambers that would allow the secretary of state’s office to<a href="https://www.cnhinews.com/cnhi/article_5b6f8720-65f7-11ed-b64d-73d5351c7abf.html"> appoint election marshals</a> from the Department of Public Safety. The marshals could be dispatched to investigate potential voting violations as they occur during the November elections and primaries, the bills state. A marshal would be appointed in each of the state’s seven Department of Public Safety regions, it said. &#8220;Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our democracy. When we get credible complaints of election irregularities, we are statutorily required to investigate,&#8221; Ogg said in a statement. “It is my duty as the elected district attorney to follow the evidence and follow the law, and I will.&#8221; Neither Scott nor Ogg elaborated on the nature of the complaints received. Similar bills have been filed before but did not make it out of committee, per state records.</p>

I hope that we can not only excite Arlington voters about the potential, give them an opportunity to express the full range of their preferences, but also provide a model to other communities.” The Board’s decision makes Arlington the first locality in Virginia to move forward on adopting ranked-choice voting. The change, which would only apply to primaries run by the county’s Office of Elections, comes months ahead of the primary. Legally, the Board has until March 22, 2023 to enact RCV for the June 20 primary. Local political parties will declare whether they will pick their nominee via a primary run by Arlington’s election office or a party-run convention.</p>

Justice William Montgomery wrote the order declining the request by the southern Arizona county. Montgomery did not include a reason for the denial in the short two-page order. The County Board of Supervisors is now asking a judge to order its elections director to expand its hand-count of ballots cast in the election. The board is requesting a judge to<a href="https://fronterasdesk.org/content/1825639/cochise-county-requests-court-compel-its-elections-director-expand-hand-count-audit"> compel the county’s Elections Director</a> Lisa Marra to conduct an expanded hand-count of 16 out of the 17 precincts, or hand them over to the Cochise recorder. The expansion of the audit comes from unfounded conspiracies sowing distrust in voting machines. Two Republicans who control the board Cochise County on Wednesday told a judge they want to<a href="https://news.azpm.org/p/azelections/2022/11/16/213811-cochise-county-leaders-end-hand-count-lawsuit-cite-recount/"> withdraw a lawsuit</a> they had filed just two days prior that sought to force their own elections director to hand-count all the ballots cast in-person on Election Day.

Blaney said that the group is confusing Arizonans and causing damage to the Citizens Clean Elections Commission. That’s a voter-approved group that educates citizens on candidates and organizes debates. Clean Elections USA members had been monitoring ballot drop boxes. Blaney said the activities have resulted in calls and emails from angry members of the public confused and assumed the commission had been the ones watching.  People referred to commission employees as racist, fascists and liars. The ruling further barred Clean Elections USA founder Melody Jennings from using that name or similar variants in election activities. That includes social media posts, websites, emails or any other media.</p>

According to Connecticut law, the constitutional amendment must be passed either by two-thirds of the vote or with a simple majority in two successive Connecticut General Assembly terms and then approved in a referendum.  in the lawsuit against early voting, Soto claims that the two proposals passed in 2019 and 2021 are substantially different, and thus cannot count as one continuous effort.  The lawsuit is being heard at the Connecticut Superior Court in Hartford. While the lawsuit is in court, the early voting constitutional amendment remains in effect. “The plaintiff has not sought, and the court has not issued a stay in this case,” said Elizabeth Benton, spokeswoman for Attorney General William Tong, in an email to the News.</p>

In a press release, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Warnock for Georgia campaign and the Democratic Party of Georgia are challenging a bulletin sent by the secretary of state&#8217;s office that says counties may not offer early voting on Saturday, Nov. 26, because of a 2016 state law that prevents certain Saturday voting if a state holiday is immediately before or after that date. The Democratic groups argue the Secretary of State&#8217;s office is misinterpreting the section of state law dealing with Saturday voting and holidays, arguing the language in the code section only applies to a &#8220;primary or general election&#8221; like the text of the code says and not a runoff.</p>

State Rep. Deanne Mazzochi filed a lawsuit against DuPage County Clerk Jean Kaczmarek, claiming her office was improperly verifying signatures on mail-in ballots. Mazzochi argues in the suit that the state Election Code requires signatures on mail-in ballots be verified by using a person&#8217;s most recent voter registration record. However, Mazzochi&#8217;s lawsuit claims the county clerk&#8217;s office hasn&#8217;t been complying with the statute. &#8220;At least three individuals, including Mazzochi herself, have witnessed the verification of mail-in ballots that have signatures that do not match the voter&#8217;s registration record, where election officials subsequently &#8216;verify&#8217; the signature by comparing it to the signature that appears on the mail-in ballot application,&#8221; the lawsuit states. Orel granted Mazzochi&#8217;s request for a temporary restraining order prohibiting the clerk&#8217;s office &#8220;from using any signature on a vote by mail application in connection with validating signatures.&#8221; In explaining the rationale for his ruling, the judge said use of a vote-by-mail application to validate signatures on the vote-by-mail ballot itself &#8220;would be an obvious way to commit ballot fraud.&#8221; &#8220;Consequently, the ruling &#8230; benefits both candidates, as well as the DuPage County Clerk&#8217;s Office, who is obligated to follow the statute,&#8221; Orel wrote in the order.

A group of election deniers from across the state asked for the 2020 presidential election be rendered void and redone, the elimination of existing voting machines, the elimination of drop boxes, the elimination of Kansas’ three-day grace period for advance ballots and for the launch of a criminal investigation into Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab. Crabtree rejected the lawsuit on the grounds that it was outside his jurisdiction. In an earlier order, Crabtree called the suit “long on suspicion, contingency, and hypothesis, but short on facts and identifiable harm.” “We have proven the integrity of the Kansas election system for four years. We appreciate the judges who sided with the facts,” Whitney Temple, a spokeswoman for Schwab, said in a statement.</p>

Officials in the county first started a hand-counting process on Oct. 26 but the Nevada Supreme Court ordered it shut down a day later, siding with the American Civil Liberties Union’s objections to volunteers reading election results aloud. Nye County resumed a revised version of its hand-counting last week after Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske ordered the county to halt its counting until after polls closed.</p>

Deputy Attorney General George Cohen said that the poll worker “inadvertently failed to get vote results” before the machine was sealed. According to Cohen, the individual, who was not identified in a short court hearing today, removed two USB sticks before the voting machine before the uploading of results had been completed.  As a result, one included results and the other did not – and election officials can’t know which machine they have results from. This is a fairly routine matter.  In New Jersey, a court order is required for election officials to open a machine during the fifteen days after the election.  One Democrat and one Republican will be present.</p>
<p>Superior Court Judge Benjamin Telsey signed an order today<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/local/in-an-abundance-of-caution-cumberland-gets-court-order-to-open-machines/"> permitting the Cumberland County Board of Elections to open voting machines</a> to retrieve emergency ballots that had been cast but might not have been recorded. Deputy Attorney General Levi Klinger-Christiansen said the election board sought the order “under an abundance of caution.” One Democrat and one Republican will be present at the unsealing of the machines and will together deliver the ballots to the Board of Elections. State law requires voting machines to be impounded for fifteen days and that has been extended to seventeen.</p>

Houle’s lawsuit challenges the counting of ballots cast during Tuesday’s election. She contends the Orange County Board of Elections is<a href="https://patch.com/new-york/midhudsonvalley/houle-sues-skoufis-orange-county-elections-board-over-results"> in possession of ballots that have not been counted</a> — specifically 501 unopened ballots and an undetermined number of affidavit ballots — and that there were several voting machines that were defective, resulting in inaccurate tallies of votes. Houle is seeking a court order to preserve all ballots and voting materials, poll books, spoiled ballots and more related to the election of the state senator for the 42nd District. She also wants the court to declare her the duly elected candidate to represent the state Senate District 42.</p>
<p>State Supreme Court Justice Scott DelConte has ruled that more than 1,200 affidavit ballots can be counted as planned,<a href="https://www.syracuse.com/crime/2022/11/cny-judge-allows-1200-ballots-to-be-counted-as-planned-in-tight-ny-senate-us-congress-races.html"> denying a last-minute challenge to a new state law</a>. DelConte issued his decision at exactly 10 a.m., the time that Oswego County had planned to begin counting the ballots. Onondaga County will follow suit at 1 p.m. Tuesday. The judge’s decision will move forward the counting of ballots in all Onondaga County races, including the competitive races for the 22nd Congressional District and sheriff. Onondaga County has already screened more than 1,000 of these ballots, but haven’t opened up the envelopes to count up the votes inside. Oswego County has nearly 300 more of these ballots. But a lawyer for Republican state Senate candidate Rebecca Shiroff argued Monday that both sides should have a chance to make objections, if necessary, to affidavit ballots that the boards of election have deemed valid. That’s the way the process worked before this year. A new state law, however, changed the process and may prevent the candidates from making objections on a ballot-by-ballot basis. The validity of the ballots is now up to the bipartisan boards of elections, Onondaga County lawyers argued. The state Board of Elections split on the issue during arguments Monday, with the Republican commissioners agreeing that the candidates should still be able to challenge affidavit ballots, and the Democratic commissioners arguing that the new law leaves those decisions to each board of elections.</p>

The Tulsa County Election Board counted provisional ballots Friday, which added some votes beyond what was tallied just on election day. Of 748 provisional ballots examined by the board, 319 were accepted and counted Friday. The addition of the provisional ballots changed the totals for the District 5 race to Mykey Arthrell, 5,043 votes, and Grant Miller 5,070. Arthrell filed a petition alleging irregularities that include some voters not being issued ballots. The Election Board has acknowledged that problem and engaged the Sheriff’s Office for an investigation. The Board said as many as 31 voters didn’t get the council ballot, while Ronald Durbin, an attorney for Miller, said the actual number is lower. The three member Tulsa County election board watched the count of the last few ballots Friday, while 15 spectators watched. Arthrell said he’s been unable to get specifics from the Election Board about the ballots, so he wants the court involved to compel some answers. Miller filed a request for a manual recount, while claiming the results should stand that have him winning. A hearing is planned for November 17, in Tulsa District Court.</p>

On Election Day, police were called to Meadville&#8217;s 1st Precinct 1st Ward polling location at Grace United Methodist Church, 828 N. Main St., around 11 a.m. after Denman became agitated with both election poll workers and voters. After voting in person via machine, Denman had refused to leave the polling station, according to election officials. Denman then claimed to be a poll watcher, but had no credentials or poll watcher certificate, officials said. Police charged Denman with creating &#8220;unreasonable noise during polling hours that did create annoyance and alarm to poll workers and voters.&#8221; Meadville Police Chief Michael Tautin confirmed Denman did have a handgun on his person, but also had a valid concealed carry permit for it that was shown to officers. Denman never showed the weapon to anyone at the polling station and made no overt threats, Tautin said.</p>

Abbott has called on the Secretary of State, The Attorney General’s Office, and the Texas Rangers to initiate an investigation. Tatum released a statement Monday: &#8220;The Harris County Elections Administrator’s Office is fully committed to transparency regarding the processes and procedures implemented for the November 8, 2022, Midterm Elections. As already established, Harris County has been selected to participate in the 2022 SOS Audit and has been in communication with the SOS Auditing team regarding this election. The office is currently completing vote tabulation of provisional ballots in preparation for the statutorily required manual count that must occur before canvassing. The last day to Canvas is November 22, 2022. The office is currently reviewing issues and claims made about Election Day and will include these findings in a post-elections report to be shared promptly with the Harris County Elections Commission and the County Commissioner Court.&#8221;</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/event/democracy-down-ballot-unpacking-2022-midterms-voting-rights-and-local-electoral-reforms">Democracy on the (Down) Ballot: Unpacked the 2022 Midterms, Voting Rights and Local Electoral Reforms</a>:  During the 2022 midterms, voters not only cast a ballot to decide the balance of power in congress, but in in many states voters decided on a range of consequential ballot initiatives impacting the nuts and bolts of the electoral process including voter-ID laws, party primary reform, ranked choice voting, and proportional representation. The outcomes of these statewide and local level ballot initiatives have direct implications for future elections and participatory democracy. This midterm recap webinar will go beyond the candidate horse race and focus on analysis and perspectives from advocates and scholars on recent voting-related ballot initiatives, immediate implications for future elections, and what’s ahead for emerging electoral reforms at the state and local level.  Join panelists Deb Otis, Director of Research at FairVote; Jenny Lee, Deputy Director of the Coalition of Communities of Color; and Wendy Underhill, Director of Elections and Redistricting at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Ash Center Director of Democracy Initiatives Nick Chedli Carter will moderate. <strong>When:</strong> November 22, 12pm. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://informed22.interkinnect.com/">Informed Conversations on Democracy in the Digital Age</a>: Informed brings together key leaders and experts to engage around the biggest questions at the intersection of technology, media, and democracy. Presented by Knight Foundation, the gathering will be an important opportunity for policymakers, researchers and the private sector to discuss the latest trends and research in this emerging field, while strengthening relationships that lead to more informed policy in the public interest. Internet technologies have brought unprecedented social advantages and helped democratize access to information and ideas. However, in recent years, these same technologies have also been exploited to mislead, disenfranchise and undermine democracy. As the internet continues to evolve, the challenges to an informed citizenry are likely to intensify in years to come. Informed will be a critical forum to explore these challenges and viable solutions. <strong>When:</strong> November 28-30. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aei.org/events/what-is-the-future-for-primaries/">What is the Future for Primaries?</a>:  The primary was devised a century ago as a corrective to the backroom bargains previously used to pick candidates. Today, this Progressive-era reform is a common means to select candidates for general elections. In recent years, however, the primary system has come into question as an effective method for nominating political candidates in an era of intensifying polarization, with many proposals to reform, restructure, or overhaul it. Join AEI’s Howard Husock, Kevin Kosar, and John Fortier; Ethics &amp; Public Policy Center’s Henry Olsen; Brookings Institution’s Elaine Kamarck; Hoover Institution’s Benjamin Ginsberg; and the Republican Party of Virginia’s Michael Ginsberg for two panel discussions on whether party primaries are the most effective means to select legislators and how they shape governance in a time of partisan polarization. If you are unable to attend, we welcome you to watch the event live on this page. After the event concludes, a full video will be posted within 24 hours. <strong>When:</strong> November 29, 10am. <strong>Where:</strong> Washington, DC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/events/close-look-independent-state-legislature-theory">A Close Look at the ‘Independent State Legislature Theory’</a>: Produced by The Brennan Center in partnership with the New York City Bar Association The so-called “independent state legislature theory” is front and center in Moore v. Harper, one of this Supreme Court term’s most watched cases. This radical theory holds that the Electors Clause and Elections Clause in the Constitution give state legislatures the authority to make decisions about federal elections without the oversight of state courts — and despite the existence of state constitutional provisions purporting to govern such elections. First proposed in the aftermath of the 2000 election, the theory has gained prominence during litigation over the 2020 election. Adoption of this dangerous theory could impact, for example, states’ ability to ban political gerrymandering.  In this timely program, prominent scholars and practitioners will explore whether the independent state legislature theory has any valid constitutional underpinnings, the historical origins of the relevant constitutional clauses, and the challenges that a Supreme Court decision endorsing this theory would present for our democracy. <strong>When:</strong> November 30, 6pm. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
