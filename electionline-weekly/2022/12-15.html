							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Wither Twitter?</strong><br />
<em>Changes to social media platform could impact election officials</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><a href="https://clerk.ingham.org/departments_and_officials/county_clerk/">Ingham County, Michigan</a> Clerk Barb Bayrum thinks it’s important to use every tool available to speak to the voters in her county with Twitter being one of those tools.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5908" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Twitter-300x253.png" alt="" width="198" height="167" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Twitter-300x253.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Twitter-768x649.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Twitter.png 798w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" />Byrum said her personal Twitter account has been a successful way to speak to a wide audience quickly and she admits that she’s enjoyed using it.</p>
<p>But the ends are more important than the means, Byrum said, which are to bolster public confidence in our elections process, assure the public that professional elections administrators are keeping our elections safe and secure, and spread truth in the face of election conspiracies and misinformation.</p>
<p>“I believe that Twitter has been a rather effective tool,” Byrum said. “I cannot go out these days without someone telling me that they’ve read my twitter thread on recounts, my reminders to candidates about their campaign finance filings, or my daily #JokeThenVote jokes (those have been very popular). It is gratifying that people are finding my posts informative and useful, or at least entertaining.”</p>
<p>Back in May, according to<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/05/05/10-facts-about-americans-and-twitter/"> Pew Research</a> around one-in-five U.S adults (23%) said they used Twitter, which is on par with Snapchat and WhatsApp but pales in comparison to use of YouTube and Facebook and is also less than Instagram.</p>
<p>Still, despite its lower usage, state and local elections officials have found it to be a useful social media tool. However, the recent purchase of Twitter by Elon Musk and some of the immediate changes made by Musk are giving election officials, and others, pause.</p>
<p>“We’ve found Twitter to be a very effective tool for communicating with Iowans about elections, business filings and other topics of interest. At this time, we plan to continue to use Twitter much in the same manner as we have over the past eight years but will continue to evaluate things,&#8221; said Paul Pate,<a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/"> Iowa Secretary of State</a>.</p>
<p>Collier Fernekes, research analyst and Katie Harbath, fellow for<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/policy-area/digital-democracy/"> Bipartisan Policy Center’s Digital Democracy Project</a> have been monitoring threats to elections and election officials on social media and urge caution with using Twitter moving forward.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6706" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/socialmedia-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/socialmedia-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/socialmedia.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“It’s truly too early to really know, but caution is warranted. It’s hard to tell at the moment how much Elon Musk is really changing about Twitter’s policies and how much the layoffs are really affecting their ability to enforce those policies,” said Fernekes and Harbath said. “Recently, Musk<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/12/12/musk-twitter-harass-yoel-roth/"> dissolved Twitter’s trust and safety board</a>, which is concerning when it comes to the spread of misinformation and keeping the platform a more civil place for discourse. In the short term, our worry is the possibility of any correspondence between the platform and election officials being leaked and used as an example of how the government pressured Twitter to remove content. That could absolutely increase the amount of threats to election officials.”</p>
<p>According to Amy Cohen, executive director of the<a href="https://www.nased.org/"> National Association of State Election Directors</a>, NASED is monitoring potential changes at Twitter closely.</p>
<p>“We encourage election offices to keep a close eye out for potential impersonation of election office or election official accounts as Twitter considers changes to verification procedures,” Cohen said.</p>
<p>Because Twitter did, briefly, implement verification for purchase, election officials also need to understand how to determine whether an account has a checkmark because it is “notable in government, news, entertainment, or another designated category” or if it has a checkmark “because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue” (hint: click on the checkmark in the profile).</p>
<p>“This can help offices better understand who they are interacting with on the platform, as well as help offices explain the differences to voters and guide them to reliable sources – election officials – for information about elections,” Cohen said. “Finally, given staffing changes at the platform, election offices should be cautious about sharing information, including credit card information, with the platform.”</p>
<p>Previously, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Digital Democracy Team conducted a<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/event/tech-platform-training/"> training</a> with tech companies for election officials on how to use their platforms safely as well as what avenues of contact election officials can use in the case of threats or reporting misinformation and other issues.</p>
<p>BPC also released a<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/how-to-protect-elections-online/"> report</a> on how tech companies can better help protect election officials online, which also has some recommendations for election officials who are wanting to use tech platforms safely. Some recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare responses before they are needed for social media as to get ahead of misinformation that may be spreading or voter questions</li>
<li>Use Multi-Factor Authentication on all accounts and follow strong password criteria</li>
<li>Turn on alerts for logins on accounts to be notified every time someone logs into an account</li>
<li>Remember that it is not possible to address every piece of misinformation</li>
<li>Look for removal request options on platforms to request the removal of personal information or harmful content</li>
<li>Election officials and tech companies should rely on CISA resources</li>
<li>Tech companies should collaborate with election officials to design great products such as voter information centers and voter registration modules</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8179" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CISAonSocialMedia-300x158.png" alt="" width="300" height="158" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CISAonSocialMedia-300x158.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CISAonSocialMedia.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />While neither CISA nor the EI-IASC are considering new guidance for Twitter usage, both organizations have previously put out guidance that could continue to be helpful. The EI-ISAC’s<a href="https://docs.cisecurity.org/en/latest/bp/mdm_info.html"> Managing Mis-, Dis-, and Malinformation</a> and CISA’s<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/mdm"> Mis, Dis, Malinformation</a> page</p>
<p>Officials we spoke with, on and off the record, are taking a wait and see approach and exploring other options. For now, Electionline will continue to use Twitter to push out links for the Daily News and the Weekly.</p>
<p>“I am disappointed with the changes that have already started to promulgate throughout the platform and even more disappointed with the conduct of the new owner,” Byrum said. “I will continue to maintain my Twitter presence for now, but I am actively exploring other options, like TikTok and Post to see if they are a better fit.”</p>
<p><strong>A connection for “geeks”</strong><br />
While election officials may never have seen the  large numbers of followers, likes, or retweets on Twitter in comparison to the number of citizens they served for many in the elections world — officials, scholars, “geeks”, etc. Twitter is/was a place to connect with others and gather ideas.</p>
<p>“I think for me personally, and I would assume for the election community at large, Twitter was a way to share ideas and information with one another and with the media,” said Jennifer Morrell, partner at<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/"> The Elections Group</a>. “It also created an unofficial social network for election nerds. It let us cheer on one another, put a spotlight on injustices or issues, highlight best practices, or just cheerlead democracy from the sidelines. In some ways, I think the loss of it (if that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed) will have more of an impact on the election community than on how we communicate with voters.”</p>
<p>Like others, Morrell is exploring options like Post or Mastodon, if for nothing else, to secure her desired username.</p>
<p>“I have set up an account on Post (mostly so I can retain my @votinggeek username). I tried doing the same on Mastodon and got a message that the username was already taken so that was a bit disconcerting,” Morrell said. “I have no plans at the moment to be active on either platform but I&#8217;ve also stepped back from regular posting on Twitter until I get a better sense of where this is all heading.”</p>

							<h2>Ethics in Election Administration</h2>
														<p><strong>Ethics in Election Administration</strong><br />
<em>Election Center and Auburn revisiting ethical guiding principles</em></p>
<p><em>“Freedom can best be maintained and nurtured through the democratic process. The success of the democratic process requires fair and open elections which accurately reflect the will of the electorate.”</em></p>
<p>In 1997, these words from the<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/"> Election Center</a>’s Task Force on Election Reform introduced the <a href="https://electioncenter.org/electionresources/documents/principles%20color.pdf">Principles of Election/Registration Officials</a> and its companion Standards of Conduct for Election/Registration Officials, developed by the nation’s election administrators and voter registrars as the ethical standard for the field.</p>
<p>The Election Center and Auburn University are again revisiting the ethical principles that guide the field in its Ethics in Election Administration research project, which began in 2021 in response to concerns about public trust in elections raised during the 2020 election.</p>
<p>“Trust in election administration has never faced greater challenges,” said Stephen Richer, <a href="https://recorder.maricopa.gov/">Maricopa County, Arizona</a> Recorder. “Election officials throughout the country must meet and create solutions.”</p>
<p>Partnering with Auburn University faculty, the Election Center has expanded into applied research and practice through the Institute for Election Administration Research &amp; Practice, which has been awarded funding from <a href="https://www.squareonefoundationchicago.org/">Square One Foundation</a> to pursue practical tools that link communications, ethics, and public trust in elections.</p>
<p>“Right now the American people want reassurance that our elections are secure and fair,” said Sarah Greathouse, member of the <a href="https://www.montgomery.boe.ohio.gov/">Montgomery County, Ohio</a> board of elections. “Defining ethical standards is vital to showing that elections are run by people who are trustworthy and hold each other accountable.”</p>
<p>Election Center members and election system stakeholders met December 1-2 in Chicago in initial focus groups to build on the framework developed by Auburn professors Kathleen Hale and Mitchell Brown.</p>
<p>“Maintaining the highest ethical standards in this challenging environment is essential to building trust with the public and giving voters confidence that their ballot was counted as cast,” said Lawrence Norden, senior director of the Election and Government Program at the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center</a>, one of the stakeholders. “We look forward to working with the Elections Center, Auburn University, and other partners to develop an updated set of ethical guidelines for the profession that’s built on the best practices that many election officials across the country are already doing every day.”</p>
<p>According to former local election official and new Election Center CEO of Programs Tammy Patrick, election officials take their oath of office very seriously—having a set of principles and standards of conduct is the logical extension of that commitment and is the cornerstone of the election profession.</p>
<p>“We can take nothing for granted in this moment. We must rally around the core principles of the election profession and remind each other that we are in this together, standing strong in the face of adversity we cannot take for granted the most basic tenets of the life’s work so many have embraced.”</p>
<p>Input from the focus group will inform the development of new communication tools for the field, as well as enhanced training for local election officials through the Election Center in its CERA/CERV Program, the national certification program for election officials, voter registrars, and election equipment vendors.</p>
<p>“Now is the time to revisit those commitments, to remind ourselves and the public being served of the seriousness of the tasks at hand, and to renew our pledge to protect, to nurture, and to defend this Great Experiment,” Patrick said.</p>

The report update<a href="https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/dcim-2022-yearend/"> provides an updated analysis</a> of the nationwide trend of partisan state legislatures considering laws that increase the risk of election subversion, and examines the impact of the 2022 midterms on that risk. Over the course of the year, state legislatures considered a range of proposals that would increase the risk of election subversion. After the 2022 midterm elections, the risk of election subversion has materially decreased, as voters largely rejected election denier candidates for statewide office in key battleground states. That said, the risk of election subversion is still present in state legislatures as we head toward 2023 legislative sessions, and the 2024 election season. “As we warned, the modern election subversion movement burst with activity in the wake of 2020, as legislatures sought to undermine the will of the voters and put the health of our democracy at risk by implementing a wide variety of proposals aimed at increasing the possibility of election subversion,” said Victoria Bassetti, senior counsel for the States United Democracy Center. “We tracked over 400 attempts to pass legislation that would put free and fair elections on the chopping block in states across the country. But during these past midterm elections, voters displayed a vigilant rejection of these hyper-partisan actors and stood firm to protect some of the most at risk states from falling into turmoil. As we head towards 2024, we will continue to analyze the anti-democracy playbook to ensure we can keep them from changing the rules and changing the game in their favor.”</p>

Made up of a non-partisan group of experts from politics, election administration, academia, and technology, the working group was charged with determining the kinds of technical and implementation standards needed to ensure safe and secure internet ballot return. The group was convened with support from Tusk Philanthropies.  “Internet ballot return has the potential to serve voters experiencing barriers to more traditional forms of voting,” said Mike Garcia, a cybersecurity and election security expert who chaired the working group. “It could also be valuable in the event of broad disruptions like wildfires or floods. But current technology cannot provide the level of security needed for widespread use in public elections—at least not yet.” “We are living through a time of intense skepticism about elections when the very foundations of the democratic process are under threat,” said CSP director and former homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano. “It is imperative that voting accessibility be balanced with security, transparency, and equity. The working group brought their expertise to bear on this important topic, and I thank them for their service.” The working group noted the need for more research into possible technological solutions for internet voting. They urged increased investment at all levels of government to ensure elections that are accessible and secure, regardless of voting method.</p>

Even in the face of hatred and violence, as well as some 45 arrests, Lewis remained resolute in his commitment to what he liked to call “good trouble.” The stamp features a photograph of Lewis taken by Marco Grob on assignment for the Aug. 26, 2013, issue of Time magazine.” Lewis died at the age of 80 in 2020. &#8220;I&#8217;m honored that this new stamp will join Atlanta&#8217;s John R.

Probate Judge Patrick Davenport, whose office oversees elections, asked commissioners to adopt a resolution in favor of the local legislation, which will now have to be advertised. The pay increase would take effect for the 2024 election. Poll workers currently receive $110 for about 20 to 25 hours of work, Davenport said. The chief inspector at each polling place receives $150. Under the increases, poll workers would be paid $125 and the chief inspector would be paid $200. The local legislation also creates a deputy chief inspector position for each poll site. That individual would serve as second in command to the chief inspector and be paid $150. “We have an amazing group of poll workers that are dedicated election after election after election,” Davenport told county commissioners. “They come and serve and they spend a lot of time in training; and then as you gentlemen know, the Election Day is a long day at the polling location. We have not been able to provide them a compensation increase in some time.”</p>

Councilor Kendra Lara, who represents Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury, said she will attempt to clear a path for immigrant voting, though she is still strategizing about the appropriate legal mechanism.  “It’s definitely going to come in 2023,” she told GBH News, “whether it be with a home rule petition, a charter referendum or an ordinance.” How the city would define “immigrants with legal status,” Lara said, remains an open question to be solved once a proposal is put forward. A notification a hearing on the issue defined the term with several specific categories of non-citizens including “lawful permanent residents,” also known as green card holders, “visa holders, Temporary Protected Status recipients, and Deferred Actions for Childhood Arrivals recipients.”</p>

Democratic Commissioner Susie Hughes, who is the board’s vice chair, sided with Republicans in the 5-3 vote in favor of the merger. Republican board Chair Bob Scolnik was absent. Efficiencies and cost savings were cited for the reason to merge. Online options to complete business with both offices have reduced the workload, proponents also argued. During an<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/2022/11/muskegon-county-needs-to-forego-politics-reject-merger-of-register-of-deeds-clerk-most-say-at-public-hearing.html"> earlier, required hearing</a> on the matter, the board was warned by clerks and register of deeds from elsewhere in the state – including those running combined offices – not to pursue a merger because there are not cost savings. On a second reading,<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/2022/12/merger-of-clerk-register-of-deeds-narrowly-rejected-in-muskegon-county.html"> the bill failed to gain the two-thirds</a> majority necessary to approve the merger, according to state law. Board Chair Bob Scolnik, who cast the deciding vote, said though he believes the offices should be merged, this was not the right time to do so.</p>

For ranked-choice voting,<a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5812787&amp;GUID=4E1673C6-A420-422B-8B62-2E1E6D20170C&amp;Options=&amp;Search="> Intro 696</a> would replace the form language that the Board of Elections uses for the instructions on RCV ballots with clearer language using fewer words. The legislation also requires that non-English text be arranged so that it is easily comparable to the corresponding English text. Ung says she looks forward to these common sense ballot changes being implemented in time for the June 2023 primaries.   “New Yorkers pulled off the largest ranked-choice voting election in the history of the U.S. when they went to the polls in last year’s June primary,” Ung said. “This new law will simplify the ballot and make it easier to understand, encouraging all voters, especially those with limited English proficiency, to take advantage of the opportunity to rank their preferred candidates and strengthen the democratic process.”</p>

Additions to the bill included requiring a valid photo ID when a person votes in person on the day of an election, and those voting absentee in person. Those who can’t show a photo ID in person will be required to cast a provisional ballot and return to the local board of elections four days after the election, a change from the previous seven days voters had to “cure” their ballot. The absentee voting period is shortened under the bill as well, with the deadline changing from three days before an election to a week before. Curbside voting will be removed as an option for many voters, according to the bill, unless the voter has a disability rendering them “physically unable to enter a polling place.” The boards of elections will now have shortened deadlines as well, specifically when it comes to counting absentee and provisional ballots. Under the bill, they will be required to start counting late-arriving and “cured” absentee and provisional ballots five days after the election, rather than the current timeline, in which they start the count 11 days after. Drop boxes are limited to one per board of elections site, a point of controversy for voting rights advocates over the years. The original bill, the language for which stayed in the version passed by the Senate, eliminates August special elections, except when a school district in fiscal emergency needs one. At 12:30 a.m. on December 15 — after an earlier break for a holiday party — the<a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2022/12/15/in-early-morning-vote-ohio-house-agrees-to-send-voter-id-restrictions-to-the-governor/"> House approved</a> the legislation by vote of 55 to 32.</p>
<p>According to <em>The Columbus Dispatch</em>, Ohio lawmakers appear to be shelving a controversial proposal that would have made it<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/politics/2022/12/13/ohio-constitutional-amendment-resolution-stalls-amid-disagreements/69722144007/"> harder to amend the state constitution</a> − at least for now. House Speaker Bob Cupp said that it&#8217;s &#8220;doubtful&#8221; lawmakers will take up the resolution this week before they adjourn for the rest of the year. The measure, if passed and approved by voters, would have required 60% of voters to enact proposed constitutional amendments, instead of a simple majority of 50% plus one. The resolution, introduced by state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, needed to clear the state House and Senate with 60% of the vote to be placed on the ballot. Secretary of State Frank LaRose urged the Legislature to pass it before the end of the year so he could put the ballot question before voters in May.</p>

Daniel Deasy of Allegheny County&#8217;s impending bill would enable county boards of election to<a href="https://patch.com/pennsylvania/pittsburgh/pa-early-voting-process-would-expand-under-house-bill"> establish early voting sites</a> that would open 15 days before primary and general election dates. The sites would have uniform operating days and hours and would be required to be open at least eight hours on each weekday and a total of eight hours on weekends. Deasy said his legislation would require county election board to monitor early voters to ensure they don&#8217;t vote again at another early voting site or on Election Day. &#8220;Pennsylvania only has early voting by allowing voters to request a mail-in ballot at a county elections office, wait for it to get approved on the spot, fill it out, and turn it back in immediately,&#8221; Deasy wrote in a memo to colleagues. &#8220;I propose a devoted system of true early voting, at more locations, which will increase voting access for our constituents.&#8221;</p>

As of last week, GOP legislators had already prefiled 20 bills in the Texas House and Senate. When the legislative session begins in January, they’re likely to consider many of them seriously.  Most of the bills fall into three categories: legislation that would impose harsher penalties for infractions; expand the state attorney general’s authority to prosecute election and voting crimes; and create a new law enforcement unit dedicated exclusively to enforcing and prosecuting election and voting crimes. The new bills “all kind of generally fit under the bucket of criminalizing voters and voting behavior, and just generally turn elections into crime scenes, where there is this presumption that there is some kind of widespread illegal conduct or activity, despite the fact that there is no evidence that’s the case,” said Liz Avore, a senior policy adviser at Voting Rights Lab, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that tracks voting and state election bills. Texas Democrats have also been busy, prefiling 42 bills already, all of which, in various ways, aim to ease existing restrictions on voting and voter registration. Advocates note, however, that most aren’t likely to advance in the state, where Republicans hold both chambers of the Legislature as well as the governorship.</p>

If a judge won&#8217;t declare her the winner, Lake wants an order requiring Maricopa County to re-do the gubernatorial election. That filing came within a five-day window from certification of the election result that is set in Arizona law, and on the same day that several defeated Republican candidates filed their own challenges.<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23404240-cv2022095403-complaint-in"> Lake&#8217;s 70-page lawsuit</a> includes a laundry list of problems and allegations related to the Nov. 8 election, including echoing many claims she has raised in recent weeks over long lines and printer issues creating &#8220;chaos&#8221; at voting locations. She claims &#8220;hundreds of thousands of illegal ballots infected the election in Maricopa County. The lawsuit also references issues that were raised, and repeatedly debunked, in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential contest and the subsequent Arizona Senate review of the Maricopa County election. Many of the claims in Lake&#8217;s lawsuit lacked supporting evidence, or were said to come from eyewitness or &#8220;expert&#8221; accounts that The Arizona Republic could not independently verify. The lawsuit alleges &#8220;intentional misconduct&#8221; leading to problems with machines and that ballots were &#8220;illegally injected&#8221; into the election by county contractors. She claims between 15,600 and 26,200 voters were disenfranchised by &#8220;catastrophic failures of tabulators&#8221; at Election Day voting sites, though the issues were actually with printers, and she cites an opinion poll of 800 voters as the basis to extrapolate that tens of thousands were disenfranchised.</p>
<p>Democratic Secretary of State-elect Adrian Fontes and Secretary of State Katie Hobbs have filed<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/12/14/fontes-and-hobbs-file-motions-to-dismiss-finchem-election-suit/"> motions to dismiss</a> Republican Mark Finchem’s lawsuit seeking to overturn his loss in the secretary of state race.  Last week, Finchem and failed congressional candidate Jeff Zink filed a suit demanding the courts overturn Fontes’ and Rueben Gallego’s midterm election wins, and making sprawling claims of election malfeasance at the hands of Maricopa County and Hobbs.  The lawsuit includes no evidence that ballot tabulators malfunctioned anywhere in Arizona — the issues in Maricopa County were caused by malfunctioning ballot printers — or that voters were disenfranchised. This week Finchem filed a<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23453622-finchem-v-fontes-election-challenge-first-amended-complaint"> new amended lawsuit</a> which did not include Zink, who lost his election to Gallego, an incumbent Democratic congressman, by more than 50 percentage points. Finchem wants his election loss to Fontes overturned, a statewide hand-recount of all ballots and a court order that the attorney general investigate Hobbs for what he claims was self-dealing and threatening public officials.</p>

The Denver-based appeals court affirmed the sanction based on the &#8220;inherent power&#8221; of judges and also a federal law that says a lawyer can be liable for costs for &#8220;unreasonably and vexatiously&#8221; extending a court case. &#8220;An attorney is expected to exercise judgment, and must &#8216;regularly re-evaluate the merits&#8217; of claims and &#8216;avoid prolonging meritless claims,'&#8221; 10th Circuit Chief Judge Jerome Holmes, sitting with Circuit Judges Timothy Tymkovich and Veronica Rossman, wrote in their unsigned order.

Conservative Supreme Court Justice David Viviano agreed with his colleagues in a concurring opinion Friday, although he added the high court should address proper interpretation of a citizen’s audit right. “But whatever (that right) means,” Viviano wrote, “it surely cannot be that each qualified elector can undertake his or her own separate audit of an election.”</p>

He is demanding state election officials stage a recount by hand; maintaining state law provides him that opportunity. Attorneys for the State of Nebraska dispute state law specifies a hand recount as an option in contested elections. Hearing the case, Lancaster District Court Judge Kevin McManaman raised questions that reflected his skepticism about the unusual request. Russ Barger of Lincoln lost the general election in Legislative District 26 to George Dungan by 224 votes, or a difference of more than 1% of the ballots cast. State law only allows for an automatic recount if the margin falls under the 1% threshold. Barger&#8217;s race does not meet that threshold, but he wants to pay for the recount with his own money. Barger&#8217;s attorney, David Begley, told the judge, &#8220;the human eyeball can catch something the machines might miss.&#8221; In an attempt to force a recount, Barger filed a &#8220;writ of mandamus,&#8221; which asks a judge to force a segment of the government to perform its duties properly. In this case, Barger argued, Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen, a Republican, failed to proceed with a recount as requested. Evnen&#8217;s office oversees elections at the state level.</p>

The decision, issued after the parties argued the case on Monday, alters but doesn’t outright reject a decision issued by Queens Supreme Court Justice Joseph Risi earlier this month. Risi ordered the city’s Board of Elections to count the ballots as is, citing time concerns – it’s been well over a month since the votes have been cast.  At the heart of both the appellate justice and Risi’s ruling was the fact the Board of Elections failed to notify the 94 voters that their ballots had been rejected, as they are required to do by law.  “The Board failed to perform its duty under the Election Law,” the justices said in the decision. “Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have granted the petition to the extent of directing the Board to comply with [the law] by notifying each of the 94 voters whose absentee ballots were invalidated…of the invalidation of his or her absentee ballot, the reason for such invalidation, and the opportunity and procedure to cure the defect by filing a cure affirmation.” As per decision, the BOE will now be required to notify the 94 voters, and give them an opportunity to fix their ballots and finally make their voice heard in the closest race in recent New York City electoral history.</p>

Russell was arrested last week and made his first appearance December 12 in Cleveland. U.S. District Magistrate Judge Jonathan Greenberg ordered Russell jailed until a hearing on his detention Thursday. His case will be likely transferred to federal court in Arizona. The charges listed in court records do not name Hobbs specifically, but quoted material in an FBI affidavit matches verbatim a threatening voicemail left at Hobbs’ Secretary of State office. Russell sent three threats to Hobbs’ Secretary of State office, the first coming on Aug. 2, according to court records. He called Hobbs a traitor and said she did nothing to protect the integrity of the 2020 election. “You better put your sh—, your f&#8212;&#8211;g affairs in order, ‘cause your days are extremely numbered,” Russell said on the voicemail, according to court records. “America’s coming for you, and you will pay with your life, you communist f&#8212;&#8211;g traitor b&#8212;h.” On Sept. 9, Russell left another message, calling Hobbs a terrorist and saying that she’s lucky she’s “still walking around on this planet,” court records say. Russell left another voicemail on Nov. 15, the day after Hobbs won the governor’s election, in which he said: “A war is coming for you. And we will stop, at no end, until you are in the ground.” He added that she’d “signed her own death warrant.”</p>

In rejecting the petition, Guido wrote that the residents did not allege any act of fraud or error to justify a recount under the law.</p>
<p>Chester County Common Pleas Court Judge Jeffrey Sommer has<a href="https://www.dailylocal.com/2022/12/10/sommer-to-election-critics-this-fishing-expedition-must-end/"> denied the request to open ballot boxes</a> in almost a dozen precincts across the county where Democratic candidates were overwhelming successful by voters who said they believed that election fraud had occurred there. In a withering 17-page decision, Sommer tuned aside the contentions by the voters that they should get access to the ballots to prove that there had been some sort of skulduggery in the election, evidence of which the attorney representing them said existed but which he refused to produce. Sommer filed his order denying the request “with prejudice,” meaning the litigants are legally prohibited from re-filing their demands in Common Pleas Court.</p>
<p>Two members of the Lycoming County Patriots group filed a suit against Lycoming County officials on Dec. 6 for failing to conduct a<a href="https://www.northcentralpa.com/news/crime/lycoming-county-patriots-sue-county-for-failure-to-audit-2020-election/article_34d2b6fe-7700-11ed-97e9-f35a9b0052c8.html"> forensic audit of the 2020 election</a> after they presented officials with alleged evidence of fraud. The lawsuit says the plaintiffs had shown the commissioners &#8220;evidence of fraud, numerous irregularities, and violations of the Election Code.&#8221; However, the commissioners have not done the forensic audit of the election as the group requested, nor have they investigated the fraud claims, they said. The plaintiffs are asking that the forensic audit be done by an independent third-party.</p>
<p>The top-ranking Republican in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives asked a court late last week to prevent voters from<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/pennsylvania-gop-special-elections-pa-house-majority-battle/"> filling three vacant seats</a> in February that will determine majority control of the chamber.  Rep. Bryan Cutler of Lancaster, who served as speaker until Nov. 30, asked Commonwealth Court to issue an injunction, naming the Department of State, acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman and the Allegheny County Elections Board as defendants.  Cutler’s filing came days after his Democratic counterpart as floor leader, Rep. Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia, claimed the mantle of the chamber’s presiding officer and sent the state orders scheduling the elections for Feb. 7.</p>
