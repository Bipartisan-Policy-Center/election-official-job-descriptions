							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Summer Reading 2022</strong><br />
<em>You can’t work all the time so here are some reading options</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>In the eyes of most, summer officially starts this weekend. Camping, trips to the beach, picnics and primary elections in more than half of the states.</p>
<p>While elections officials will be busy conducting primaries and preparing for the November General Election, hopefully the summer of 2022 means a bit of time away from the office with friends, family and maybe a good book.</p>
<p>If you’re like us and simply cannot leave work at work, we’ve pulled together some elections-related “beach” reading for your summer travels or just for those quiet times on your porch.</p>
<p>We’ve linked to the books through their Amazon descriptions however you may want to also consider making your purchases through<a href="https://bookshop.org/"> Bookshop.org</a> which makes donations to local bookstores.</p>
<p>And if this list doesn’t pique your interest, here are some suggestions from<a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2021/05-27/"> last year</a>.</p>
<p>Happy reading. Happy summer. Hopefully happy time off.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8416" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ElectionMadLibs-184x300.png" alt="" width="184" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ElectionMadLibs-184x300.png 184w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ElectionMadLibs.png 570w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px" />For Everyone</strong><br />
Do we really need to have any other books on our summer reading list than<a href="https://www.readbrightly.com/books/9780593094037/election-day-mad-libs-by-landry-q-walker/"> Election Day Mad Libs</a>? Great for road trips, the beach or sitting around a camp fire. And they aren’t just for kids either.</p>
<p><strong>For The Younger Set</strong><br />
We wanted to include books for future voters as well so I reached out to my friend who is an administrator at a school in California and her school librarian happily provided electionline with some suggestions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vote-Me-Ben-Clanton/dp/155453822X">Vote For Me</a> by Ben Clanton — A satire of American politics finds a donkey and an elephant resorting to just about anything to garner votes, and after all the mud-slinging is done and the votes are tallied, they are both quite surprised by the results.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Needs-Your-Vote-Me/dp/1938063635/ref=asc_df_1938063635/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=312041961788&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=6429683735304034594&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9061285&amp;hvtargid=pla-568334414813&amp;psc=1">Monster Needs Your Vote</a> by Paul Czajak — With speeches, debates, and a soapbox or two, Monster campaigns for an issue he believes in and encourages kids to do the same.</p>
<p><a href="https://lernerbooks.com/shop/show/13646">U.S. Government Through Infographics</a> by Nadia Higgins— Trying to comprehend the US government can almost make your mind shut down. You need to understand how it stacks up to governments around the world (from democracy to dictatorship), how systems and laws change over time (years ago, women couldn’t vote!), and who holds the power today (how do big decisions get made?). How can all these laws and ideas make more sense? Infographics! The charts, maps, and illustrations in this book tell a visual story to help you better understand key concepts about our country’s government.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/When-You-Grow-Vote-Government/dp/1626728798/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8419" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GrowUpToVote-203x300.png" alt="" width="203" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GrowUpToVote-203x300.png 203w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GrowUpToVote.png 318w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" />When You Grow Up to Vote: How Our Government Works for You</a>, Eleanor Roosevelt— In the voice of one of the most iconic and beloved political figures of the twentieth century comes a book on citizenship for the future voters of the twenty-first century. Eleanor Roosevelt published the original edition of When You Grow Up to Vote in 1932, the same year her husband was elected president. The new edition has updated information and back matter as well as fresh, bold art from award-winning artist Grace Lin. Beginning with government workers like firefighters and garbage collectors, and moving up through local government to the national stage, this book explains that the people in government work the voter.  Fresh, contemporary, and even fun, When You Grow Up to Vote is the book parents and teachers need to talk to children about how our government is designed to work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F43S88D/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The U.S. Constitution: Discover How Democracy Works with 25 Projects</a>, Carla Mooney— In The U.S. Constitution: Discover How Democracy Works, children ages 9 through 12 learn about the foundation of democracy and how the documents crafted hundreds of years ago still have an impact on our country today. They explore the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, among others. These documents provide a framework with which we make the laws and processes that help keep democracy a vital paradigm. Through hands-on projects, which include analyzing how the promises made in the Preamble of the Constitution were put into practice and investigating how to balance the freedom of speech in the digital age, students investigate how American democracy operates. With colorful illustrations, interesting sidebars, and links to online primary sources, this book asks readers to consider the effect of technology on democracy and make predictions about future documents that will be important to the preservation of democracy around the world.</p>

In refreshingly candid and straight-to-the-point language author Elissa Grodin takes readers of all ages on an A-Z trip through our government&#8217;s structure, from its earliest beginnings to definitions of basic components and concepts (including immigration and taxation). Engaging, disarming, and frequently thought-provoking artwork from illustrator Victor Juhasz emphasizes the magnitude of the subject. From founding fathers, first ladies, and the First Amendment to the presidential oath of office, D is for Democracy details the political processes, parties, and people of democracy, American-style.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Equalitys-Call-Voting-Rights-America/dp/1534439587/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Equality&#8217;s Call: The Story of Voting Rights in America</a>, Deborah Diesen— The founders of the United States declared that consent of the governed was a key part of their plan for the new nation. But for many years, only white men of means were allowed to vote. This unflinching and inspiring history of voting rights looks back at the activists who answered equality’s call, working tirelessly to secure the right for all to vote, and it also looks forward to the future and the work that still needs to be done.</p>

Backmatter includes information about the United States electoral <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8420" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GoodNightAudit-296x300.png" alt="" width="296" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GoodNightAudit-296x300.png 296w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GoodNightAudit.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" />process.</p>

In the Internet age, as more readers consume news on various websites and social media platforms, it is important for young readers to be able to determine which sources qualify as good sources of information and which qualify as nothing more than misinformation or rumors. This book helps young readers to explore the sources of their information, defines what both good and bad sources are, and teaches young readers why it is important to ask themselves, Are these good sources of information?</p>

Uncovering Bias in the News looks at the ways in which multiple media outlets can cover the same story in vastly different ways, the reasons for these differences, and how to recognize bias in a news report.</p>

Hasen— What can be done consistent with the First Amendment to ensure that American voters can make informed election decisions and hold free elections amid a flood of virally spread disinformation and the collapse of local news reporting? How should American society counter the actions of people like former President Donald J. Trump, who used social media to convince millions of his followers to doubt the integrity of U.S. elections and helped foment a violent insurrection? What can we do to minimize disinformation campaigns aimed at suppressing voter turnout? With piercing insight into the current debates over free speech, censorship, and Big Tech’s responsibilities, Richard L. Hasen proposes legal and social measures to restore Americans’ access to reliable information on which democracy depends. In an era when quack COVID treatments and bizarre QAnon theories have entered mainstream, this book explains how to assure both freedom of ideas and a commitment to truth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Messing-Enemy-Surviving-Terrorists-Russians/dp/0062795996/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1653500156&amp;sr=8-1">Messing with the Enemy: Surviving in a Social Media World of Hackers, Terrorists, Russians and Fake News</a>, Clint Watts— A former FBI Special Agent and leading cyber-security expert offers a devastating and essential look at the misinformation campaigns, fake news, and electronic espionage operations that have become the cutting edge of modern warfare—and how we can protect ourselves and our country against them. Watts examines a particular social media platform—from Twitter to internet Forums to Facebook to LinkedIn—and a specific bad actor—from al Qaeda to the Islamic State to the Russian and Syrian governments—to illuminate exactly how social media tracking is used for nefarious purposes. He explains how he’s learned, through his successes and his failures, to engage with hackers, terrorists, and even the Russians—and how these interactions have generated methods of fighting back. Shocking, funny, and eye-opening, Messing with the Enemy is a deeply urgent guide for living safe and smart in a super-connected world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Active-Measures-History-Disinformation-Political-ebook/dp/B07RYGH7YN/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=active+measures+thomas+rid&amp;qid=1653500283&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=Active+Meas%2Cstripbooks%2C72&amp;sr=1-1">Active Measures: The Secret History of Disinformation and Political Warfare</a>, Thomas Rid— The story of modern disinformation <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8414" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ActiveMeasures-188x300.png" alt="" width="188" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ActiveMeasures-188x300.png 188w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ActiveMeasures.png 296w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" />begins with the post-Russian Revolution clash between communism and capitalism, which would come to define the Cold War. In Active Measures, Rid reveals startling intelligence and security secrets from materials written in more than ten languages across several nations, and from interviews with current and former operatives. He exposes the disturbing yet colorful history of professional, organized lying, revealing for the first time some of the century’s most significant operations—many of them nearly beyond belief. A White Russian ploy backfires and brings down a New York police commissioner; a KGB-engineered, anti-Semitic hate campaign creeps back across the Iron Curtain; the CIA backs a fake publishing empire, run by a former Wehrmacht U-boat commander, that produces Germany’s best jazz magazine. Rid tracks the rise of leaking, and shows how spies began to exploit emerging internet culture many years before WikiLeaks. Finally, he sheds new light on the 2016 election, especially the role of the infamous “troll farm” in St. Petersburg as well as a much more harmful attack that unfolded in the shadows. Active Measures takes the reader on a guided tour deep into a vast hall of mirrors old and new, pointing to a future of engineered polarization, more active and less measured—but also offering the tools to cut through the deception.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Lose-Information-War-Conflict-ebook/dp/B088RMM9RH/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=how+to+lose+the+information+war&amp;qid=1653500336&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=How+to+lose+the+%2Cstripbooks%2C66&amp;sr=1-1">How to Lose the Information War: Russia, Fake News, and the Future of Conflict</a>, Nina Jankowicz— How to Lose the Information War takes the reader on a journey through five Western governments&#8217; responses to Russian information warfare tactics &#8211; all of which have failed. She journeys into the campaigns the Russian operatives run, and shows how we can better understand the motivations behind these attacks and how to beat them. Above all, this book shows what is at stake: the future of civil discourse and democracy, and the value of truth itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fight-Vote-Michael-Waldman-ebook/dp/B0112OOQ20/ref=sr_1_1?crid=VGWWU6IPUEEZ&amp;keywords=The+Fight+to+vote&amp;qid=1653500486&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+fight+to+vote%2Cstripbooks%2C287&amp;sr=1-1"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8417" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FightToVote-188x300.png" alt="" width="188" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FightToVote-188x300.png 188w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FightToVote.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" />The Fight to Vote</a>, Michael Waldman— As Rep. Lewis said, and recent events in state legislatures across the country demonstrate, the struggle for the right to vote is not over. In this “important and powerful” (Linda Greenhouse, former New York Times Supreme Court correspondent) book Michael Waldman describes the long struggle to extend the right to vote to all Americans. From the writing of the Constitution, and at every step along the way, as disenfranchised Americans sought this right, others have fought to stop them. Waldman traces this history from the Founders’ debates to today’s many restrictions: gerrymandering; voter ID laws; the flood of dark money released by conservative organizations; and the concerted effort in many state legislatures after the 2020 election to enact new limitations on voting. Despite the pandemic, the 2020 election had the highest turnout since 1900. In this updated edition, Waldman describes the nationwide effort that made this possible. He offers new insights into how Donald Trump’s false claims of fraud—“the Big Lie”—led to the January 6 insurrection and the fights over voting laws that followed one of the most dramatic chapters in the story of American democracy. As Waldman shows, this fight, sometimes vicious, has always been at the center of American politics because it determines the outcome of the struggle for power. The Fight to Vote is “an engaging, concise history…offering many useful reforms that advocates on both sides of the aisle should consider” (The Wall Street Journal).</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>SEC Primary 2022<br />
</strong><em>Voters in AL, AR, GA and Texas vote in primaries this week</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />

<p>This week’s round of primary elections were referred to by some as the SEC primary because every state has colleges or universities that are SEC teams. Voters in Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia headed to the polls for the first time while voters in Texas completed their primary season that began back in March. Overall, it was relatively smooth sailing on Tuesday with small pockets of issues. The primary runoff in Texas showed a marked improvement from the original primary in March where thousands of mail ballots were rejected because voters didn’t complete them in ways required by new state law.</p>

Polls in Leary, Edison, and Arlington were reported to have experienced technical issues during voting hours, with some polls resuming sessions later in the afternoon. Because the polling machines were down, there were continued issues throughout the night after the polls had closed.

Tallapoosa County sheriff Jimmy Abbett has already been in touch with the National Guard and we expect a smooth transition.” In the<a href="https://whnt.com/news/zeigler-allen-in-gop-runoff-for-secretary-of-state-2/"> race for secretary of state</a>, on the Republican side, outgoing State Auditor Jim Zeigler and Rep.

The outage started at 3:30 p.m. how votes are being counted. Officials say one polling location was impacted due to not having any power. Operations were moved from the county courthouse to the Sheriff’s office annex. “So this is really just a different location of where will be counting the process will be the same the poll workers will bring their ballot boxes all the materials to a different location to election night I’ll have all the equipment we need done at the sheriff&#8217;s annex,&#8221; said Jennifer Price, Washington County Director of Elections. While voting ran smoothly, officials in<a href="https://www.ky3.com/2022/05/25/northern-arkansas-county-clerks-report-complications-election-night/"> Baxter County</a> had election night tallying issues including a lost thumb drive that was found on the floor of a bathroom. “A gentleman told me he had found it (thumb drive) in the bathroom but didn’t want to pick it up. Meanwhile, we were running because we didn’t have the thumb drive from Midway and were re-running the ballots,” Election Commissioner Judy Garner said in an interview with KTLO. The county recounted that the center’s paper ballots and the state Election Commission confirmed all procedures happened correctly. Due to technical difficulties, election commissioners in<a href="https://www.ky3.com/2022/05/25/northern-arkansas-county-clerks-report-complications-election-night/"> Marion County</a> suspended counting votes late Tuesday night. The commission issued a statement saying they had technical problems with the machines and stopped trying to get the votes counted at 11:15.

County elections officials and the county GOP had<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/24/voting-harris-county-delays/"> sparred over how election night would be handled</a> and the county GOP even<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/houston/article/GOP-sues-to-halt-Harris-County-election-counting-17196159.php"> sued the county</a> around 2pm on Tuesday challenging the county’s plan to move ballots to a central spot for counting. And while the county had warned that results could be delayed, Election Administrator Isabel Longria said things went even better than planned and the results were not delayed. “We certainly think this went smoothly,” said Leah Shah, spokeswoman for the county elections office. “Credit goes to the county workers who made sure we were fully staffed and able to deliver results.” Some fast-moving storms did have a minor impact on in-person voting in<a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/politics/elections/storms-cause-equipment-issues-harris-county-polling-locations/285-62984e3a-9976-40b6-8228-b629150a33e9"> Harris County</a> on Tuesday.

Hall released a plan<a href="https://dochub.clackamas.us/documents/drupal/56d0c627-0ba5-4fde-a6b5-ff3dcbffea24"> via a memo</a> on the county’s elections website. The memo says all of the votes will be counted within nine days, and the election will be certified as planned by June 13. Staff is currently copying votes from the original ballots onto new ones by hand. The secretary of state’s office had asked for the plan after polls closed last week.  According to Oregon Public Broadcasting, the ballot issue has garnered a lot of attention and inspired more conspiracy theories about the state’s vote-by-mail system. Some have even called on the secretary of state’s office  to take over the elections office in Clackamas. “The statute is very, very clear,” Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said. “And so, there are folks out there, I think just out of frustration saying, ‘Fagan should take over.’ It’s just simply the law doesn’t provide for that. Our north star is to make sure the voters of Oregon … have certainty in the accuracy of the results by June 13.” If the secretary of state’s office were to take over, Fagan said, the state would end up with a “summer full of lawsuits” over whether the election was conducted legally. “We’re not going to go anywhere near that. We’re going to make sure to stay in the boundaries of the law,” Fagan said.</p>

Chapman announced this week that there would be a<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania-senate-recount-oz-mccormick-election-ballots-court-20220525.html"> statewide recount</a> of the Republican senate race. Chapman said that Mehmet Oz led David McCormick by just 902 votes, or less than 0.08% of the more than 1.3 million ballots cast in their race. Following the press event, evening the margin had shrunk even further. That put their contest well within the 0.5% margin of victory that triggers an automatic recount under state law. And as Pennsylvania’s 67 counties prepared to begin the retallying process as early as Friday, Chapman vowed the recount would take place “transparently, as dictated by law.” “I know Pennsylvanians and, indeed, people throughout the country have been following this race attentively and are eagerly awaiting the results,” she said. “I thank everyone for their patience as we count every vote.” The recount in the McCormick-Oz race is only the seventh time one has been automatically triggered since the implementation of the 2004 law that required them in close races. Over the next two weeks, elections officials will run all counted mail and in-person ballots through different scanning machines than those they used in their original counts to confirm their totals. They must complete this process by June 7.</p>

Trainer Chad Brown and owner Seth Klarman skipped the Derby which paid off. &#8220;We thought he needed a little more seasoning, the extra rest would help him,&#8221; Klarman told ESPN. &#8220;He was pretty lightly raced &#8212; only three races before today. And as it turned out, that was the right call. We wanted to do right by the horse, and we&#8217;re so glad we waited.&#8221; Early Voting won the race in 1:54.54 and paid $13.40, $4.60 and $3.60. Epicenter paid $2.80 and $2.40 for place and show, and Creative Minister was third and paid $4.20 to show. The Early Voting team has already said they won’t head to New York for the Belmont, but as for what lies, ahead, maybe the Breeder’s Cup, scheduled for November 5—three days before Election Day. I’m just sayin’.</p>

Votebeat will provide full-time, nonpartisan local coverage of election administration and voting in four states — Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Texas — through the 2022 midterm elections and beyond.  &#8220;Today is an important milestone in Chalkbeat’s evolution, proving that Chalkbeat’s model of topical, local, and philanthropically supported news can extend beyond education,” said Elizabeth Green, Chalkbeat CEO and co-founder. “In the long term, we envision Votebeat operating in every state across the country, and we are excited to bring this vision to fruition.” Chalkbeat launched Votebeat as a popup local newsroom during Election 2020, placing reporters in<a href="https://streaklinks.com/BDzM3ccPD_P8ziRQ0QuEeNWN/https%3A%2F%2Fvotebeat.org%2Fwho-we-are%2F"> 10 partner newsrooms across eight states</a>. This network of reporters strictly covered the process and mechanics of voting — no polls, candidate platforms, or election day results — and instead maintained a strict focus on how elections are run, from early and mail-in voting to voter registration and election security. Votebeat’s mission is to help people understand the country’s system of democracy so they can participate in strengthening it — to fill a void in the information ecosystem with facts and nuance on how voting works. Votebeat’s editorial approach will be to produce coverage that counters misinformation through clear explanation, to point to solutions that make voting more accessible and fair, and to spotlight bad actors. The longer-term vision of Votebeat is to employ one to three local reporters in all 50 states, exclusively covering election administration and voting year-round, given the long-term need for accountability and engagement on the topic. Votebeat will make their stories available, at no cost, to local news outlets throughout Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Texas. Votebeat is launching with formal editorial partnerships with Bridge Michigan, Spotlight PA, and The Texas Tribune — three nonprofit news organizations that were among Votebeat’s original partners during its 2020 project phase.</p>

The initiative recruited more than 700,000 poll works in 2020 and looks to build on that success for this year. “In 2020, we were blown away by the number of people who raised their hands to support our democracy and be a poll worker for the first time, especially amid a pandemic,” said Jane Slusser, Program Manager for Power the Polls. “This year, poll worker shortages in a number of states have caused polling places to close, making it more challenging for voters to access the ballot box. We’re looking forward to building on our success from 2020 and ensuring voters from every community can cast their vote in 2022.” Slusser said Power the Polls would look to reengage the 700,000 people who signed up to be potential poll workers in 2020, encouraging them to get in touch with their local election offices to work again.

														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3748" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> A bill is on Gov. Doug Ducey’s desk to make it a felony to allow someone to<a href="https://fronterasdesk.org/content/1781242/bill-passes-make-registering-vote-and-casting-ballot-election-day-felony"> register to vote and cast a ballot on Election Day</a>.  That however is already not legal in Arizona. Voters cannot cast a ballot if they register less than 29 days before an election. Democratic Sen. Martin Quezada said.  &#8220;This is just a political platform to expound upon the Big Lie that our elections are not safe and that our voter registration procedures are not legitimate. And this one is just silly. One, we don&#8217;t have same-day voter registration in place right now, at all. This doesn&#8217;t exist,&#8221; Quezada.  The bill’s sponsor Republican Rep. Jake Hoffman does not dispute it is already illegal to do so. But signatures are being gathered to change voting laws to allow same day voting.</p>
<p>Ducey has<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/arizona-governor-signs-a-lineup-of-covid-19-and-election-reform-bills/"> signed the following bills</a> into law:</p>
<p>Under Senate Bill 1108, an automatic recount would occur at the county level if an election count was within 0.5% between the two candidates. House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding of Phoenix supported that bill, leading to a wave of Democratic support. The move from .1% to .5% was lauded by Gov. Ducey’s office in a statement. “As Arizona’s population grows, it is necessary and prudent to continue prioritizing accountability,” Ducey said. “This election result confirmation process puts Arizona more in-line with other states’ procedures.”</p>
<p>Senate Bill 1329 mandates a county recorder to provide a real-time tabulation of ballots on Election Day by counting the number of early ballots returned at voting locations. The county recorder would also post these totals with the latest unofficial election count on its website.</p>
<p>The Senate has rejected a bill offered by Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita (R-Scottsdale) that would have required<a href="https://apnews.com/article/arizona-phoenix-government-and-politics-legislature-voter-registration-a3df449c70d8566633baf4656016cf8d"> drop boxes</a> to have video monitoring. Ugenti-Rita said drop boxes are rife with possibilities for “ballot harvesting,” a pejorative term for dropping off completed ballots for other people. The Legislature in 2016 made it a felony to return another person’s mail ballots unless it is for a family member or if the person returning the ballot is a caregiver. But GOP Sen. J.D Mesnard noted that banning drop boxes outright would essentially kill the bill, because there’s no support in the House for going as far as Ugenti-Rita was proposing. The original House measure would have completely banned unmonitored drop boxes, but it did not have the votes to pass so it was watered down to allow counties to set up video monitoring where practical.</p>

The bill will stymie increasing harassment and violent threats directed at election workers. To offset the growing wave of harassment and violent threats directed at election workers, SB 1131 will allow election workers to enroll in either of the state’s existing address protection programs — the Secretary of State’s Safe at Home program or the state’s address confidentiality program for public officials. Safe at Home, designed to protect survivors of domestic violence and people who work at reproductive healthcare facilities, redirects the mail of victims enrolled in the program to a different mailing address. Alternatively, election workers may enroll in a program that allows state and local agencies to respond to public records requests without disclosing the address of an election worker. To reduce the likelihood that poll workers may be subject to doxing and targeting, SB 1131 also would eliminate the current statutory requirement for posting the names of poll workers at polling places, yet still would require the responsible election official to post the political party preferences of people working at a particular polling place.</span></p>

Laura Kelly’s veto</a> to enact a law pushed by a conservative Florida organization in response to unfounded claims of election fraud in other states. The measure, approved with a two-thirds majority in the Kansas House and Senate, bars the Kansas governor, secretary of state and attorney general from entering into consent decrees changing election law in the state. The bill was proposed and pushed for by the Florida-based Opportunity Solutions Project. “The Legislature is the one that establishes laws,” Rep. Emil Bergquist, a Park City Republican, said. “There’s not a reason to forego the approval of the Legislature.” But the measure did not respond to any event in Kansas. Proponents pointed to a pre-litigation settlement Gov. Laura Kelly reached with Loud Light, a left-leaning civic engagement group, last year. But that agreement related to federal law on providing voter registration forms to Kansans receiving social services, state not election law. In her veto message, Kelly said the bill tied the hands of executive officials. “There are times when it is necessary or actually better to enter into a consent decree than to require that we litigate an unconstitutional law,” said Rep. Vic Miller, a Topeka Democrat.</p>

Rep. Blake Miguez, R-Erath. said on that HB 811 simply clarifies the law, and it has the support of both Attorney General Jeff Landry and Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin. The bill states: &#8220;No state or local official, including but not limited to a registrar of voters or a clerk of court, or agency responsible for conducting elections shall solicit, accept, use, or dispose of any donation in the form of money, grants, property, or personal services from individuals or profit or nonprofit corporations, for the purpose of paying costs related to conducting elections.&#8221; The legislature approved similar bills in the 2020 2nd Extraordinary Session and the 2021 Regular Session, and Gov. Jon Bell Edwards vetoed the legislation on both occasions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers have commissioned a task force to</span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2022/05/25/task-force-will-study-voting-rights-for-louisianas-disabled-people/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study the expansion of voting rights for people with disabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?s=22RS&amp;b=HCR14&amp;sbi=y"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House Concurrent Resolution 14</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Rep. Matthew Willard, D-New Orleans, received final passage Monday with a unanimous vote in the Senate.  The task force will examine amenities and procedures currently available for disabled voters and any impediments that might exist. Its members will then make recommendations that could be included in future legislation. The proposal received bipartisan support only after House Republicans removed the phrase “curbside voting” from the legislation. The original version included curbside voting as a topic to study for people who use wheelchairs or cannot physically enter a polling place, but it received heavy pushback from GOP lawmakers in the House and Governmental Affairs Committee. The final version instead directs the task force to study, at a minimum, ways to streamline how disabled voters receive “assistance when voting.”</span></p>

This time,<a href="https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/can-once-maligned-ranked-choice-voting-make-a-comeback-in-burlington/Content?oid=32397897"> only city councilors</a> will be chosen by the voting system, which allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of votes, lesser-ranked choices come into play to determine a winner. In a letter to lawmakers, Scott said he allowed the bill to become law because of its limited scope. But he wouldn&#8217;t sign it because he&#8217;s opposed to instituting ranked-choice voting statewide.  &#8220;I believe one person should get one vote,&#8221; Scott wrote, &#8220;and candidates who get the most votes should win elections.&#8221;</p>

In legal papers filed in Mohave County Superior court, attorney Alexander Kolodin contends the state’s Constitution requires ballots to be cast in person on Election Day.  While the original lawsuit sought to completely eliminate early voting, this new one would allow for specific exceptions, such as being elderly or plans to be away on Election Day.  Though arguing for some exceptions could undermine the basic arguments that the Legislature cannot allow for early voting in all cases.  In the last general election, nearly 90% of all ballots were cast early.</p>
<p>In a tentative ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Dominic Lanza rejected claims by Mi Familia Vota and others that the 2021 law eliminating the state’s<a href="https://www.kawc.org/news/2022-05-23/voting-rights-groups-may-be-able-to-challenge-arizona-law-eliminating-permanent-early-voting-list"> permanent early voting list</a> unconstitutionally interferes with the right to vote. Lanza said that the statute, approved by the Republican-controlled legislature, imposes only a minimal burden. And he said the state has presented legitimate reasons, including reducing costs of having to send out early ballots to people who may not be interested in using them. But the judge said that evidence presented by challengers shows the law will have a disparate impact on different racial groups. And it&#8217;s that effect &#8212; coupled with the comments of Rep. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, that has Lanza telling the lawyers in the case that he&#8217;s inclined to let the case go forward. The law spells out that if someone does not return an early ballot in at least one of four prior elections &#8212; meaning a primary and a general election in two successive years &#8212; that person is dropped from what would no longer be called the permanent early voting list.</p>

It was brought by Robert Beadles, a Washoe County Republicans central committee member and funder of opposition efforts against a number of local officials and candidates. The suit&#8217;s stated intent was to get the court to provide more clarity to legislative edicts allowing the public to meaningfully observe ballot tabulation.  Defendants in the case were the Nevada Secretary of State’s office and the Washoe County Registrar of Voters, with the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada signing on as an “intervenor” opposing the lawsuit. Walker said it was “clear to me” the lawsuit was not about observation but about participation because it asks the court to allow the vote counting process to be stopped at the say-so of an observer. He said the plaintiffs — Beadles and 25 additional Washoe County registered voters — seemed to want to audit the vote count rather than merely observe. “What I have is multiple plaintiffs who filed an unsworn, unverified complaint,” Walker said from the bench after a one-hour hearing, adding “I have in front of me, in fact, no competent evidence which supports the claims.”</span></p>

A full statewide primary usually costs as much as $30 million, and local elections officials have said more money will be needed to administer the additional election.  The organization&#8217;s suit seeks to move the state Assembly and statewide primaries to Aug. 23 as well in order to save money and reduce voter confusion.  “The State Board of Elections, apparently with the support of the leaders of both major political parties, put in place a deliberately exclusionary electoral regime for statewide offices designed to limit further competition in the primary and from independent candidates in the general election,&#8221; said Laura Ladd Bierman, the executive director of the League of Women Voters. &#8220;Our suit requests the Court to order the postponement of the statewide primary from June 28 to August 23, 2022 – the same date as State Senate and Congressional primaries &#8212; and extend the deadline for gathering signatures for both the party primaries and independent candidates seeking to qualify for the general election.”</p>

In an amicus brief filed Friday, the U.S. Department of Justice said federal courts — including the Supreme Court — have repeatedly upheld individual citizens&#8217; ability to challenge racially discriminatory policies and practices under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. By throwing its weight behind the North Dakota case, which the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians and the Spirit Lake Tribe filed in February, the administration seeks to rebuke a growing view among conservatives that private parties cannot allege a Section 2 violation. North Dakota Secretary of State Alvin Jaeger took that stance in a bid to dismiss the tribes&#8217; lawsuit last month, noting that Justice Neil M. Gorsuch has said lower courts are treating the issue &#8220;as an open question.&#8221; But the Justice Department hit back, saying it has a &#8220;substantial interest in ensuring the proper interpretation of Section 2&#8221; and arguing that the Supreme Court has twice made clear that a private right of action exists under that statute.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5429" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Pennsylvania</strong>: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that Pennsylvania mail<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/undated-mail-ballots-pennsylvania-lehigh-county-migliori-20220520.html"> ballots submitted without a date on the envelope</a> last year should be counted. The full extent of the decision’s impact is unclear, because the court issued a judgment and said an opinion would come later. But based on the order, lawyers from both parties said, the path was suddenly cleared for counties to count the undated mail ballots they had been preparing to reject this election. The question before the three-judge panel in Philadelphia was whether to count 257 undated mail ballots in Lehigh County from last November’s general election. State law requires voters to sign and date the outside mailing envelope when they return their mail ballots, and state courts have held that the requirement means undated ballots must be rejected. But throwing out those votes violates the federal Civil Rights Act, the ACLU argued, because the date isn’t actually used in determining the legitimacy of a vote. The group brought the case, Migliori v. Lehigh County Board of Elections, on behalf of five voters whose undated ballots were to be rejected after a separate case wound through state courts. The judges agreed, declaring the date requirement in state law is immaterial under the Civil Rights Act — meaning it can’t be used as a reason to reject ballots. “Accordingly, there is no basis on this record to refuse to count undated ballots that have been set aside in the November 2, 2021, election for Judge of the Common Pleas of Lehigh County,” the judgment reads. The judges returned the case to the federal district court, “and that court is hereby directed to … enter an order that the undated ballots be counted.”</p>
<p>Following the Friday ruling on the 2021 ballots, Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/mccormick-files-lawsuit-boost-pa-mail-votes-tight-senate-gop-primary-rcna30206"> filed a lawsuit in a bid to ensure certain mail-in ballots</a> aren&#8217;t disqualified from last week&#8217;s Pennsylvania primary, in which his fight against Mehmet Oz remains too close to call. McCormick, in papers filed in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, said a number of county boards of election are refusing to count ballots that arrived in time for the primary but were missing handwritten dates on the envelopes. &#8220;These ballots were indisputably submitted on time—they were date-stamped upon receipt—and no fraud or irregularity has been alleged,&#8221; the suit says, adding that boards are refusing to count them because of the technicality.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania overturned the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s<a href="https://www.politicspa.com/court-says-counties-can-inspect-voting-equipment/101619/"> decertification of Fulton County’s voting machines</a> and granted all counties the authority to inspect electronic voting equipment. President Judge Emerita Mary Hannah Leavitt overruled the preliminary objection, citing that “Whether prevention thereof is the responsibility of the Secretary or of the county boards of elections, or both, is not clear. Both are government agencies created by the General Assembly with discrete and separate roles to fulfill toward the end of honest elections in Pennsylvania. The county boards of elections are not bureaus within the Department of State subject to management by the Secretary of the Commonwealth. They are separate and standalone government agencies.”</p>

State officials had asked Rodriguez to dismiss the case, arguing that federal officials did not have standing to sue them. They argued that local election officials — not state ones — were charged with implementing the new law. Rodriguez disagreed in an</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rodriguez-order-5242022.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, finding the U.S. attorney general has “broad constitutional power to protect the right to vote” and is “congressionally authorized” to go after voting rights violations. The federal government had a “significant stake” in protecting “the general welfare of its citizenry,” Rodriguez wrote. He found the U.S. government had plausibly alleged that Texas law would “disenfranchise eligible Texas citizens who seek to exercise their vote,” including those with disabilities, limited knowledge of English and “members of the military deployed away from home.”</span></p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/facts-time-fiction-reporting-truth-amid-lies-and-disinformation">Facts in a Time of Fiction</a>: Journalists have long been charged with sorting fact from fiction through their reporting. But what happens when readers redefine what they see as truth and what they’ll accept as fact?  New York Times writer and author Elizabeth Williamson is among journalists confronting the rampant rise and spread of conspiracy theories through her reporting and research. Her current work has focused around unraveling the targeted misinformation and lies spread after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Conn., the surviving families’ lawsuits against Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and the election disinformation fueling the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack.  In this instructional program with the National Press Club Journalism Institute, Williamson will share her reporting and research process, along with insights she gained as she connected the dots on how conspiracy theories grow. Williamson, whose critically-acclaimed book “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/624175/sandy-hook-by-elizabeth-williamson/">Sandy Hook: An American Tragedy and the Battle for Truth</a>” published this spring, will describe how she threaded together more than 400 interviews, 10,000 pages of court testimony and other records, and on-the-ground reporting to trace a line from conspiracy theories around Sandy Hook to Jan. 6, 2021. Participants will learn to: Identify how misinformation and political conspiracy theories have spread; Work with sensitivity and clarity while reporting on conspiracy theories;  Pre-bunk conspiracy theories through early reporting; Use trauma-informed reporting methods while working with people suffering tragedy; and Organize reporting and deep research to craft a long-form narrative. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> June 10, 11:30am Eastern.</p>
