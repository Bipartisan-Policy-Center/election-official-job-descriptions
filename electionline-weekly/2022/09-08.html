														<p><strong>NASED and NAMLE release Election Communications Toolkit</strong><br />
<em>Toolkit includes videos, tip sheets and customizable graphics</em></p>
<p>By Amy Cohen, executive director<br />
National Association of State Election Directors</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-8813" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NASEDNAMLE1-232x300.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="356" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NASEDNAMLE1-232x300.jpg 232w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NASEDNAMLE1.jpg 612w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" />Since 2021, the<a href="http://www.nased..org"> National Association of State Election Directors</a> (NASED) has worked with the<a href="http://www.namle.net"> National Association for Media Literacy Education</a> (NAMLE) to understand why people believe what they believe and how to use media literacy principles to communicate about elections (see NAMLE Executive Director Michelle Ciulla Lipkin’s series in Electionline<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/06-02/"> here</a>,<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/07-28/"> here</a>, and<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/09-01/"> here</a>).  NASED heard from our members that election officials need this information to understand how to communicate with voters and other key audiences, as well as concrete tools to use when communicating.</p>
<p>Election officials are up against an enormous challenge: there is so much information available and so much of it is inaccurate; understanding election processes requires more than 280 characters; and, election officials never have the biggest megaphone.  Communicating effectively requires more than just having a social media account or talking to as many voters as possible, and it can be time-consuming, overwhelming, and sometimes, expensive.</p>
<p>Today, NASED and NAMLE are releasing an<a href="https://www.nased.org/electioncommstoolkit"> Election Communications Toolkit</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>      Seven customizable<a href="https://www.nased.org/electioncommstoolkit#social"> social media graphics</a> (including step-by-step instructions for customization);</li>
<li>      Six<a href="https://www.nased.org/electioncommstoolkit#video"> unbranded animated videos</a>; and,</li>
<li>      10 customizable<a href="https://www.nased.org/electioncommstoolkit#tipsheets"> tip sheets</a> explaining to voters and other key audiences how to evaluate the information they consume about elections using media literacy principles.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8814" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NASED-Elections-Are-Coming_FB-300x251.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="251" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NASED-Elections-Are-Coming_FB-300x251.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NASED-Elections-Are-Coming_FB-768x644.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NASED-Elections-Are-Coming_FB.jpg 940w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />None of the resources are specific to 2022.  The Toolkit also includes sample social media posts election offices can use with each graphic, video, or tip sheet.  Everything will also be available in Spanish in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/articles/the-psychology-of-misinformation-why-its-so-hard-to-correct/">Repetition bias</a> tells us that the more people hear something, the more they believe it is true.  If purveyors of false information can use this principle to their advantage, so can election officials, the trusted sources for reliable information about elections.  Each of the social media graphics and videos use the same language to encourage voters to visit election office websites and to get their information about elections from the real experts: election officials.</p>
<p>The tip sheets’ purpose is to help voters and other key audiences become more media literate consumers of information about elections and build resilience to false information.  They cover:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">What questions should you ask before sharing information about elections online?</li>
<li aria-level="1">What questions should you ask to understand media messages about elections?</li>
<li aria-level="1">What do you need to think about when you see images and videos about elections online?</li>
<li aria-level="1">How do you know if a source of information about elections is reliable?</li>
<li aria-level="1">How do you protect yourself from false information about elections?</li>
</ul>

Tuesday represented the first election in Massachusetts where vote-by-mail and early voting were permanent law and many folks took advantage of both making for a slow, relatively drama-free day at the polls. “It’s been<a href="https://www.eagletribune.com/news/were-waterproof-merrimack-valley-braves-the-rain-to-vote/article_e3cce3d8-2e25-11ed-ad4c-5fececd450ad.html"> kind of slow</a>, but we’re also processing mail-in ballots and early ballots and absentee ballots,” said James Redmond, clerk for Andover’s First Precinct. “I think they’re getting used to the process.” In<a href="https://www.iberkshires.com/story/69355/Pittsfield-Having-a-Quiet-Rainy-Election-Day.html"> Pittsfield</a>, City Clerk Michele Benjamin reported a 34.4 turnout rate with many casting their ballots early/by mail. &#8220;It&#8217;s going pretty well, we haven&#8217;t had any problems or anything.&#8221; There were no reported issues with<a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ma/worcester/news/2022/09/06/impacting-voter-turnout-in-primary-election"> redistricting</a>. Besides the rain, the biggest issue on Tuesday came in<a href="https://www.wcvb.com/amp/article/massachusetts-primary-election-sept-6-barnstable-vault-problem/41088863"> Barnstable</a> where a mechanical issue with the town clerk&#8217;s vault. Officials said the vault, which is used to store ballots, was unable to be opened. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what happened to the door overnight, but it broke,&#8221; said Barnstable Town Clerk Ann Quirk. &#8220;We could not get it open.&#8221;  The town clerk printed emergency paper ballots, and the polls opened shortly after 11 a.m. A judge ordered that polls be opened until after midnight to make up for the lost time. In the race for<a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/09/06/massachusetts-secretary-of-state-bill-galvin-victory"> secretary of state</a>, incumbent William Galvin (D) will face Republican Rayla Campbell</p>

In 2020, the lag between the close of polls and release of unofficial results was exploited to spread misinformation. Pre-processing shortens this precarious window while strengthening election security and promoting voter access. BPC Elections recommends three ballot pre-processing best practices: Provide at least seven days before Election Day for pre-processing; Permit election officials to scan ballots into tabulators before Election Day; and Give voters sufficient time for voters to cure issues with their ballot. In this explainer, BPC focuses on the states that allow election workers to run ballots through scanners before Election Day. This policy provides the most preparation for tabulation, which occurs after polls close on Election Day and before the release of unofficial results. By understanding the benefits of this policy along with other ballot pre-election processes (ranging from verifying signatures to curing ballots), policymakers can expedite the release of unofficial election night returns, mitigating the harmful impacts of election mis- and disinformation. You can hear an interview with Rachel Orey, associate director, Elections Project, Bipartisan Policy Center  with SiriusXM about pre-processing<a href="https://elink.clickdimensions.com/c/7/eyJhaSI6MTE3NDM3MzcsImUiOiJtbW9yZXR0aUBlbGVjdGlvbmxpbmUub3JnIiwicmkiOiJjb250YWN0LTkzNGYyMDZhYTJmOGUzMTE4MTc2NmMzYmU1YTgyMTY4LThiNTNhMDNmYjU4OTRjNDhiYmQ2ZDczYjdkYjdlZDJjIiwicnEiOiIwMi1iMjIyNTAtNTg0ZmViZTg1YTBkNDkyNmE5ZmYyZmRkNDk1MzJhNWMiLCJwaCI6bnVsbCwibSI6ZmFsc2UsInVpIjoiMSIsInVuIjoiIiwidSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpcml1c3htLmNvbS9jbGlwcy9jbGlwLzY1Y2ZiMjlhLTE5NWUtNGI0NC05MWZiLTllODU1YWQ1MWUwMy9jNTY4NWE4Ny1kNjVhLTRmZjItYTg3Ni05YzAzNzZjOWU4YTY_X2NsZGVlPWtGSDZnUHhiay1QWldJZkJSdUxkaGg2TFVYWmZka1UtVDZJZk50SHkzTVdUTE56Uk1YdThERnFIUHFOVkpiOFkmcmVjaXBpZW50aWQ9Y29udGFjdC05MzRmMjA2YWEyZjhlMzExODE3NjZjM2JlNWE4MjE2OC04YjUzYTAzZmI1ODk0YzQ4YmJkNmQ3M2I3ZGI3ZWQyYyZlc2lkPTM3N2MzNDc2LTIwMmUtZWQxMS05ZGIxLTAwMjI0ODI4Yzc0ZSJ9/JYJKXBBMsuX9EYsLiZw7mw"> here</a>.</p>

It seems that many of those caught up in the probe are ex-felons who had been told that their voting rights were restored and were allowed to re-register to vote. Who was responsible for allowing the returning citizens to re-register is at the heart of the ongoing back-and-forth. “There are some local jurisdictions, they just don’t care about the election laws. We do and we think it’s important,” Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who’s up for reelection in November, said during a recent press conference. “It&#8217;s unfortunate. I think it was politically motivated and I hate to say that,” said Mark Earley, Supervisor of Elections in Leon County, home to the state’s capitol. Earley also leads the Florida’s association for Election Supervisors. These elected officials are tasked with administering elections in each county across the state. Earley doesn’t believe the Governor’s choice of words was an accident. “Those statements certainly make it more difficult to get our jobs done. We&#8217;re already in an environment stemming from the 2020 election where we&#8217;re under more threats and harassment,” Earley said. Earley told WFTS fears the governor is laying the groundwork for more suspensions, only this time it will be someone who shares his rank as a Supervisor of Election. “It certainly was not a vote of confidence in Supervisors,” Earley said in response to the governor’s remarks. “It’s disheartening. This rhetoric needs to quit.”</p>

The persistent county board voted to<a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/09/01/crow-wing-county-officials-approve-some-of-activists-demands-for-election-changes/"> hand-count November election results in twice as many precincts</a> as state law requires in a post-election review — four instead of two.  The board also voted to produce “cast vote records” — which show how election software reads cast ballots — of the 2020 election and August primary. Some of the commissioners said they had full faith in their elections but were trying to appease activists. The activists, however, were not appeased because they want all the precincts hand-counted and they don’t want the cast vote records to be randomized, although that’s automatically done, county officials said.</p>

The voter ID change is an amendment to the state constitution, which requires a higher threshold. In order to qualify, an amendment must garner 10% of voters – or 123,966 signatures – and also 5% in 38 counties. That petition received 136,458 signatures and qualified in 76 counties. Public hearings will be held in each of Nebraska&#8217;s three congressional districts about the initiative, according to the Secretary of State.

Tom Wolf  <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/wolf-signs-executive-order-expanding-access-to-voter-registration-information/">signed an executive order expanding access to voter registration information</a>. The order designates seven state agencies and programs as “Voter Registration Distribution Agencies,” that will be required to provide voter registration materials and information to state residents. They are: The Department of State (DOS) at public Bureau of Elections, Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs, and Bureau of Corporations and Charitable Organizations locations; The Department of Agriculture at events at the Farm Show Complex; The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources at 121 state park office locations; The Department of Corrections in connection with Bureau of Community Corrections services; The Department of Education at library locations; The Labor and Industry programs at CareerLink offices; The Department of Military and Veterans Affairs at state veterans homes. Under the new order, the impacted state agencies are required to provide access to: An official voter registration mail application that is not specific to any county election office; An accompanying non-postage-paid envelope and instructions explaining where the completed voter registration application should be sent; They also are required to “display nonpartisan signs or posters in highly visible areas to indicate that official voter registration materials are available on-site,” the administration said; The executive order further declares September “Voter Registration Month” statewide. The new order “builds on the requirements of the federal National Voter Registration Act of 1993 which mandates that certain state agencies are required to provide voter registration opportunity to clients with whom they interact.” the administration said.</p>

The county commissioners acting as the board of elections accepted a petition signed by approximately 3,200 voters and voted 2-1 to put that question on the November ballot. Members of the loose-knit organization who circulated the petitions claim they want to return to hand counting of ballots to ensure election integrity. Commissioner Rick Mirabito, who cast the lone negative vote, pointed out the question on the petition referred to voting machines. The county does not use voting machines, he said. Voters mark a paper ballot and feed it into the scanner to be tabulated. irabito, a former Democrat state representative, contends there is nothing in the law that gives the commissioners the authority to stop using an electronic voting system.</p>

The city said it&#8217;s not about partisan politics, but about preserving the integrity of the election process. Upper Arlington City Council Member John Kulewicz, said poll worker threats are a real problem. He has proposed a poll worker protection ordinance to protect election workers where he votes. Under the ordinance, the crime of poll worker harassment would be punishable with a misdemeanor and no less than three days in jail. Harassment would be defined under the measure as communication that would threaten, harass, coerce and menace abuse an election official or poll worker in the performance of his or her duties. &#8220;There have been reports from other Ohio counties of poll worker harassment in the past couple of years. The president of the National Association of Secretaries of State reported two weeks ago that they are seeing an increased level of threats to election officials,&#8221; said Kulewicz.</p>

The council&#8217;s Organizational Development Standing Committee, which is made up of all nine members, voted 6-3 to strike the legislation from the upcoming full council meeting. Councilmember Katherine Jordan introduced the ordinance and said she learned of the concept while running in the last election. She said, personally, she would want to know that she represents the majority of voters in her district, regardless of which choice she was.  &#8220;With this, you know that you could have confidence of saying, this is my first choice. But you know what, I&#8217;m okay with this other person to what I want I don&#8217;t want is this third candidate,&#8221; Jordan said. Richmond&#8217;s registrar would be tasked with implementing the new system if approved and Registrar Keith Balmer said voter awareness would be the biggest challenge but added that his office is prepared to engage the community. &#8220;Because one thing I don&#8217;t want is for voters to go into a polling place in 2024 confused. Like that will fall on me and I wouldn&#8217;t feel good about that. So I got to make sure that they understand the process,&#8221; Balmer said.</p>

Myers has dismissed a case filed by a group of Republican candidates who sought<a href="https://gazette.com/news/denver-county-judge-dismisses-gop-candidate-recount-lawsuit/article_3e464300-2a1a-11ed-895a-e3b0367b0b73.html"> discretionary recounts</a> in the June 28 primaries that alleged El Paso County was not conducting the recount &#8220;in a fair, impartial and uniform manner.&#8221; The GOP candidates filed a lawsuit in Denver District Court on Aug. 1 and amended it Aug. 5, specifically accusing El Paso County of using &#8220;improperly tested and unreliable electronic voting systems&#8221; to conduct the recount, completed Aug. 3. In a written order, Myers said he dismissed the claims because there is no recount to stop. When the petitioners filed their amended lawsuit Aug. 5, the recounts had already been completed and their final results certified in El Paso County and by the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office on Aug. 3 and Aug. 4, respectively.  The group is now appealing the decision with the Colorado Supreme Court, court filings show. In the appeal petitioners filed with the state Supreme Court, the candidates asked the court to declare the recount results void and reiterated their request for the Secretary of State&#8217;s Office to conduct the recount, paid for by the state.</p>
<p>Judge Andrew P. McCallin<a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/09/06/judge-throws-out-colorado-clerks-tina-peters-recount-challenge/"> threw out a lawsuit challenging a primary election recount</a> lost by an indicted Colorado county clerk who alleged voting fraud in her failed bid to become the state&#8217;s top election official. Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters filed a lawsuit objecting to the methods used to recount ballots on Aug. 3 but did not ask for the recount to be stopped until the following day, after the recount was completed and several hours after the recount results had been certified by Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold. McCallin ruled that election law only gives him the authority to consider recount challenges while a recount is underway and his jurisdiction stops once it is over and is certified. According to McCallin&#8217;s ruling, Peters said that the recount could still be challenged because she claimed it was not conducted under the methods outlined in the law. However, McCallin said that argument would allow a recount to be subject to challenge long after it was completed, pointing out that the law lays out ways for challenges to be quickly resolved so election deadlines can be met. “Allowing these orders to be challenged later would destabilize elections and leave them open for challenge long after the Secretary of State certifies results,” he said.</p>

Jack Hennessey&#8217;s<a href="https://brooklyn.news12.com/judge-hennessey-appeal-in-bridgeport-primary-can-move-ahead"> challenge of the Democratic primary</a> for Bridgeport&#8217;s 127th State House District can move forward. The Aug. 9 primary was a two-vote win for City Council Member Marcus Brown after two recounts. Stevens denied Brown&#8217;s motion to dismiss the appeal challenging his most &#8220;recent&#8221; win of the primary. Brown&#8217;s attorneys had argued that the specific appeal was filed beyond the 14-day state-mandated deadline. &#8220;We strongly disagree and are preparing our responses,&#8221; Brown told News 12 Connecticut. The first recount was ordered when Brown was leading incumbent Jack Hennessey, the city&#8217;s current longest serving state lawmaker, by five votes. After the recount, Hennessey was declared the winner. &#8220;The court has jurisdiction to consider whether the recount should not be approved because it involved the counting of ballots that should not have been counted for any reason,&#8221; said Stevens. Brown then filed an appeal in Superior Court claiming many absentee ballots were lost.</p>

Otake has ruled that<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/former-hawaii-residents-now-living-in-us-territories-barred-from-voting-in-federal-elections/"> prior residence in Hawaii doesn’t give U.S. citizens the right to cast absentee ballots for the state in federal elections</a>. “This case is not about the denial or deprivation of the right to vote, but about whether a failure to extend voting rights that do not otherwise exist violates the Equal Protection Clause. The statutes are not unconstitutional merely because they do not grant plaintiffs a right given to others, especially when plaintiffs’ fellow territorial residents lack such a right,” Otake wrote in the ruling. The case was first brought against the United States and the state of Hawaii two years ago, one month before the 2020 presidential elections. The plaintiffs claimed the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) and Hawaii’s corresponding Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act (UMOVA) unconstitutionally contribute to the disenfranchisement of residents in the territories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and American Samoa. Although residents of U.S. territories can vote in primary elections, they are barred from voting in the general presidential and congressional elections. Activists have long decried the situation, pointing out that while residents can&#8217;t have their voices heard, territories are still subject to the results of these elections.  The plaintiffs, represented by an international team of attorneys, moved for summary judgment in August, with both federal and state defendants countering. The suit named Hawaii Chief Election Officer Scott Nago, the United States of America, the secretary of Defense, and the Federal Voting Assistance Program and its director David Beirne, as defendants. Otake, at the summary judgment hearing and in her ruling Tuesday, noted that although the plaintiffs raise fair points about the limitations on voting rights for those living in the U.S. territories, “plaintiffs’ continued efforts to transform this issue into one concerning territorial voting rights is misguided and ineffective,” she wrote. Otake rejected the plaintiffs&#8217; claims that the UOCAVA and UMOVA violate the Fifth and 14th Amendments. She found former residents of Hawaii who live in territories cannot be considered a protected class and that U.S. citizens living in territories do not have a superseding right to vote in federal elections. “UOCAVA and UMOVA in fact treat plaintiffs the same as former state residents who move to another state or the District of Columbia, so the actual disparity is nothing close to Plaintiffs’ dramatic portrayal,” she wrote.</p>

Van Voorhees<a href="https://cdapress.com/news/2022/sep/08/poll-worker-found-not-guilty-electioneering/"> not guilty of electioneering</a>. The charge stems from Nov. 2, 2021, when Van Voorhees reportedly offered pamphlets printed with information about critical race theory to voters while she worked at the polls. Idaho’s electioneering law specifically forbids circulating “cards or handbills of any kind” within 100 feet of a polling place. Kootenai County Elections Manager Asa Gray told the court that poll workers, including Van Voorhees, all go through training before Election Day. The volunteers receive instruction not to discuss political matters or “anything remotely related to ballot issues” at the polling place, he said. Multiple witnesses testified that they saw Van Voorhees give and offer the pamphlets to other voters at different times of day. Denise Makinson, who supervised Van Voorhees and her fellow poll workers on Election Day, said she instructed Van Voorhees before polls opened not to give the pamphlets to voters. She testified that she told Van Voorhees twice more that day to put the pamphlets away, where voters could not see them. Van Voorhees said she made a “conscious decision” to bring the pamphlets into the polling place because she did not believe giving them to friends was inappropriate.</p>

It’s the latest twist in a knot of legal uncertainty surrounding the state’s election system, which is the only one in the United States that prevents officials from counting early ballots early. “Faced with three-to-four times as many ballots and failing to count a single one of them until two days after the election may require 100 to 120 days (or nearly 4 months),” says the<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/md-elections-board-2022-count.pdf"> petition</a>, filed in Montgomery County Circuit Court by Daniel M. Kobrin of the Attorney General’s Office. “Maryland, however, does not have 100 days; Maryland does not even have the 36 days that the primary canvass required.” The delay in certifying elections could prevent elected representatives from being seated in January as required by law. “The sheer number of ballots caused cascading issues through the local and statewide canvassing and certification process,” the petition says. “In Montgomery County, a recount of the race for County Executive could not begin until August 19, 2022, or 31 days after election day. It was concluded, with final local certification of the results, on August 24, 2022, which was 36 days after election day. In Frederick County, issues with the mail-in ballot canvass required the local board of elections to decertify its results on August 10, 2022, and re-scan all 15,640 mail-in ballots it received.”</p>

The Promote the Vote amendment proposes establishing at least nine days of early voting in Michigan, codifying existing voter ID rules in the state constitution and allowing voters to request absentee ballots for all future elections among other changes. The Republican members of the Board of State Canvassers  bucked the Bureau of Elections&#8217; recommendation to certify it for the upcoming election, instead expressing concerns about alleged defects with the Promote the Vote petition raised in a challenge. In its lawsuit, Promote the Vote asks the Michigan Supreme Court to order canvassers to certify the Promote the Vote proposal for placement on the ballot by Sept. 8. Promote the Vote denies that its proposal, if adopted by voters, would abrogate the constitutional provisions alleged by Defend Your Vote, the group that filed the challenge. Promote The Vote also argues that it is too late in the process for canvassers to take up a challenge to the petition form canvassers approved and organizers used to collect signatures to qualify for the ballot.</p>
<p>The Macomb County Republican Party has asked a federal judge to<a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/09/macomb-county-gop-asks-federal-court-decertify-the-2020-election.html"> decertify the results of the 2020 presidential election</a> in that county—648 after they were originally certified.  Ever since the 2020 election, my vice chair and I have been pushing and pushing … We really haven’t gained much at all in two years,” Macomb GOP, Mark Forton said in a video that appeared on social media. “I don’t believe a single iota of our elections has been repaired since 2020. There has been different legislative things and so on and so forth but our elections are just as corrupt today as they were then.” Russell Newman, an attorney affiliated with The America Project, one of the most prominent election denial organizations in the country, is representing one of the plaintiffs. The lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. Federal Court for Michigan’s western district, was first reported by The Detroit News. It has named Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson as defendants.</p>

An attorney for the county says the requested documents simply &#8220;do not exist&#8221; and all the county’s voting systems comply with state law. The lawsuit was filed recently against Rice County Director of Property Taxes and Elections Denise Anderson by a Lonsdale resident and an attorney from Albert Lea who ran unsuccessfully for Congress. The civil lawsuit outlines document requests made by Kathleen Hagen and attorney Matt Benda. They filed requests under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, which requires governmental entities to make many documents available to members of the public upon request. Attorney Anne Goering, who is representing the county, maintains that the county “fully complied” with the state records law requirements. “The plaintiffs in this case are seeking documents that do not exist, and they are unwilling to accept that the data does not exist,” she said.</p>

The independent state legislature doctrine would give state lawmakers the power to set election rules and draw congressional maps without any review by state courts. Some legal experts contend the doctrine could also be interpreted as allowing a legislature to refuse to certify the results of a pres­id­en­tial elec­tion and instead select its own slate of elect­ors. The North Carolina case concerns the U.S. Constitution’s Elections Clause, which says: “The times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.” In his amicus brief, Ashcroft argues that interpretation of the Elections Clause would not “leave individuals affected by redistricting without a remedy to complain about all kinds of map drawing.” Courts would still have a role, Ashcroft’s brief argues, in certain areas such as “one-person, one-vote and racial gerrymandering.”</p>

Barnett et al.</a> The settlement has the secretary of state’s office and other offices agreeing to be more diligent in protecting voting rights of Native Americans. “The settlement we negotiated details changes that South Dakota must make to provide the voter registration services guaranteed to each and every voter by federal law,” Rosebud Sioux Tribe President Scott Herman said in a statement.<a href="https://www.narf.org/nill/documents/20220823sd-nvra-settlement.pdf"> The agreement</a> calls for Secretary of State Steve Barnett to have a statewide coordinator to oversee state government and county governments’ compliance with the 1993 National Voter Registration Act. The federal law requires driver’s license offices and public assistance agencies to provide voter registration services. The judge in May had<a href="https://www.narf.org/cases/south-dakota-voter-registration/"> found various violations</a> such as not providing voter registration and not being allowed to vote.  Several state departments — Public Safety, Social Services, and Labor &amp; Regulation — now must continue recent practices that were started this summer. “This agreement requires South Dakota to establish training and accountability mechanisms so voters, including Native voters, actually receive the legally required opportunities to register to vote,” Oglala Sioux Tribe President Kevin Killer said in a statement.</p>
<p>Chief Judge Roberto Lange ordered that the Lyman County commissioner election in November is to<a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/07/lyman-county-commission-election-go-ahead-lower-brule-sioux-lawsuit/8010687001/"> go forward as planned</a>, after the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe filed a lawsuit alleging the election would dilute the Native American vote. Lange wrote in his decision that he was &#8220;entirely dissatisfied with leaving the 2022 Lyman County commissioner elections unchanged,&#8221; and has only allowed the election to go forward because of a plan to resolve the voting rights issue in 2024, rather than 2026. He added the decision did not address the Voting Rights Act issues. The lawsuit was filed in May with the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe alleging the delay of a new redistricting plan for the Board of Commissioners violated the 14th and 15th Amendments and the Voting Rights Act. The delay meant that November&#8217;s election would be held under the current at-large system, diluting the Native American vote, according to the tribe. Lange had previously issued an injunction in August that required Lyman County to come to court with a remedial plan. Lyman County came back with a plan to move up the 2024 commission election that will see two Native-preferred candidates on the ballot, instead of leaving it until 2026, according to court documents. The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe had asked instead for a special election in 2023 for the commissioners. Lange acknowledged neither side in the lawsuit liked &#8220;the more modest and more surgical approach proposed by this court.&#8221; But both sides agreed that time was short when it came to coming up with a new plan two months ahead of the election.</p>

Aprahamian granted motions to block clerks from adding the missing information to ballot envelopes and said the election officials could alert voters about the problem if they wish. At issue is guidance issued by the Wisconsin Elections Commission in 2016 that allows clerks to fix witness certificate errors without contacting voters. The guidance was not challenged until Trump began falsely claiming his election loss was a casualty of widespread voter fraud despite recounts he paid for that confirmed the result. Clerks were able to fill in missing information under the guidance, such as a ZIP code. Republican lawmakers in July voted to eliminate regulations allowing the practice but the commission did not agree to withdraw the guidance to clerks because the three Democratic members voted against doing so, resulting in a deadlock. &#8220;It is a little wonder that proponents from all corners of the political spectrum are critical, cynical and suspicious of how elections are managed and overseen when three unelected bureaucrats can defy the legislature and declined to suspend guidance that the joint committee under its oversight authority has determined violates Wisconsin law,&#8221; he said.  The decision, which comes two months before the next election, is likely heading to the state Supreme Court, which is controlled by conservative justices.</p>

														<p><a href="https://civicnation-org.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZAofuqqrD8pE9cLVyp-hSQmZ3aSsnM3AjIZ#/registration">College Student Poll Worker Recruitment</a>: In 2020, thousands of college students answered the call to serve as poll workers. This year, local election officials around the country still need more poll workers, especially tech-savvy, multi-lingual young people. Join ALL IN and the Students Learn Students Vote Coalition (SLSV) for a 30-minute webinar to learn about ideas and strategies to recruit college students at your institution to serve as poll workers, which are often paid positions, and additional benefits from establishing and maintaining a relationship with your local election officials. <strong>When:</strong> 4pm Eastern Sept. 13. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/events/national-film-premiere-suppressed-and-sabotaged-the-fight-to-vote/">National Film Premiere: ‘Suppressed and Sabotaged: The Fight to Vote’</a>:  American democracy is under threat. In recent years, many states have made it harder for people to vote and easier for partisan actors to subvert valid elections. At the same time, the U.S. Supreme Court continues to roll back Americans’ fundamental rights. Extremists at every level of government are doing their best to stop the emergence of a racially and ethnically diverse democracy and block important and popular policies. How did the United States get here, and what can be done? Please join CAP’s Reel Progress program and acclaimed film company Brave New Films for a nationwide virtual screening of “Suppressed and Sabotaged: The Fight to Vote.” This powerful 45-minute documentary sheds light on the ongoing threats to free and fair elections in the United States and ways that people can help get democracy back on track. After the film screening, join us for remarks by Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), followed by a panel discussion focused on voting rights and political power and how they intersect with abortion rights and gun violence prevention policies. <strong>When:</strong> September 15, 8pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/">National Voter Registration Day</a>: National Voter Registration Day is a nonpartisan civic holiday celebrating our democracy. First observed in 2012, it has quickly gained momentum ever since. Nearly 4.7 million voters have registered to vote on the holiday to date. Celebrated every September, National Voter Registration Day involves volunteers and organizations from all over the country hitting the streets in a single day of coordinated field, technology and media efforts. National Voter Registration Day seeks to create broad awareness of voter registration opportunities to reach tens of thousands of voters who may not register otherwise. According to U.S. Census data from 2020, as many as 1 in 4 eligible Americans are not registered to vote. Every year, millions of Americans find themselves unable to vote because they miss a registration deadline, don’t update their registration, or aren’t sure how to register. National Voter Registration Day wants to make sure everyone has the opportunity to vote. The holiday has been endorsed by the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED), the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and the National Association of Election Officials (The Election Center). <strong>When:</strong> September 20</p>
<p><a href="https://ucla.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_YAvPjQc-S3qWUjGokT7wUw">Special From the Frontlines:  The United States Supreme Court and American Democracy: View of Three Journalists</a>: The Safeguarding Democracy Project promotes research, collaboration, and advocacy under the leadership of UCLA Law Professor Richard L. Hasen; one of the nation&#8217;s leading election scholars. The Safeguarding Democracy Project is built upon the premise that tackling issues of the U.S. election integrity must be collaborative: across ideologies, across scholarly disciplines, and as a bridge between theory and practice. Moderated by Richard L. Hasen and featuring Joan Biskupic, Adam Liptak and Dahlia Lithwick. <strong>When:</strong> September 20, 12pm Pacific. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cato.org/events/foia-government-transparency-report-card">FOIA and Government Transparency: A Report Card</a>: In the more than 50 years that the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has been on the books, it has helped revolutionize Americans’ understanding of how their government works in practice. But the agencies and departments of the executive branch that are covered by the FOIA have persistently attempted to thwart its effective implementation. The most recent statutory update to FOIA took place in 2016, and with several years of experience with the revised law behind us, it’s fair to ask: Is FOIA working better now? If not, why not? What is it like to battle federal agencies and departments weekly to pry loose information dealing with immigration policy, telecommunications policy, and the national security establishment? What additional changes to FOIA are needed to truly make the law work as intended? Join our expert panel as we discuss these and related issues. <strong>When:</strong> September 22 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/disinformation-midterms-and-mind-how-psychological-science-can-help-journalists-combat">Disinformation, Midterms, and the Mind: How psychological science can help journalists combat election misinformation</a>: Journalism and democracy have been upended by the growth of mis- and dis-information. Countering it effectively requires understanding why people are susceptible, targeted, and how they can become more resilient. Psychological research can teach journalists how to prebunk disinformation and convey credibility in ways that readers, viewers, and listeners can process, which is more essential than ever as November’s elections near. Register now to join the National Press Club Journalism Institute, the American Psychological Association, and PEN America for a free program on Thursday, Sept. 29 to learn how to use these strategies for coverage that informs and empowers your community as it prepares to vote and to discuss the ways disinformation has affected the practice of journalism. The program, which will be held on Zoom, will begin at 11:30 a.m. ET and be followed by a Q&amp;A session. <strong>When:</strong> September 29, 11:30am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://voteearlyday.org/">Vote Early Day</a>: Vote Early Day is a nonpartisan movement of media companies, businesses, nonprofits, election administrators, and creatives working to ensure all Americans have the tools to vote early. This holiday is a tentpole moment for partners of all stripes to engage with voters and urge them to cast their ballots. Created in 2020, Vote Early Day has brought thousands of national and local partners together in celebration and activation to increase the number of people voting early. This collaborative, open-source model—similar to Giving Tuesday and National Voter Registration Day—ensures that millions more Americans take advantage of their options to vote early through on the ground activations, get-out-the-vote pushes, national communications on traditional and social media, and efforts to create a new culture around voting. Vote Early Day plays a unique role in the push to get voters to cast their ballot. We are a trusted, nonpartisan holiday with supporters on both sides of the aisle. We provide a central moment for a wide range of partners (many non- traditional to the civic space) to engage with voters and urge them to vote early. Our collaboration of thousands of diverse partners allows us to engage in places beyond where voters are used to seeing election messages. This allows us to break through the noise and meet voters where they are. <strong>When:</strong> October 28</p>
