														<p><strong>7 Considerations for Talking to Your Constituents About Elections</strong></p>
<p>By Amanda Zoch, Ph.D., Project Manager, Elections &amp; Redistricting<br />
<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/">National Conference of State Legislatures</a></p>
<p><em>This article was originally published in the National Conference of State Legislatures’ election administration newsletter, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/the-canvass-april-2022.aspx">The Canvass, on April 4</a>. Although the piece is directed at state legislators, many of the suggestions for managing mis- and disinformation may be helpful for election officials, as well.</em></p>
<p>Election administration, once the behind-the-scenes work of democracy, has taken center stage in the public sphere. Voters are no longer focused on just their own ballots, but on the entire election system—following and entering national debates about voting machines, poll watchers, voter registration list maintenance and more.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7443" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Add the spread of election misinformation, disinformation and malinformation, known as MDM, to this heightened public attention, and the average voter can easily become confused about what’s what.</p>
<p>If you’re a legislator, you can help.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a social media Luddite or a TikTok pro, all lawmakers are influencers. And as community leaders with firsthand experience running in elections, you are well positioned to explain how your state’s elections work and to combat any MDM that corrodes trust in that system. “Legislators are respected in their communities,” says Tennessee Rep. Johnny Shaw (D), “so they need to use that role to instill confidence.” Believe it or not, what you say, write, post or tweet can guide public perception on the accuracy and security of elections.</p>
<p>Of course, explaining elections and addressing MDM are not easy tasks. Elections are complex; MDM is pervasive. But as Carly Koppes, county clerk and recorder of Weld County, Colo., explains, “Putting in the effort to help someone understand the truth can also make them an advocate for your local elections.” A single hard conversation could have long-lasting benefits.</p>
<p>NCSL does not have all the answers, but here are seven points to consider when talking to—and preparing to talk to—your constituents about elections.</p>
<p><strong>1 — Do Your Homework</strong><br />
Election officials frequently encounter what Charles Stewart III, an MIT political science professor and director of the MIT Election Data + Science Lab, calls “how-hard-can-it-be-ism”: How hard can it be to count votes? How hard can it be to conduct an audit? How hard can it be to process absentee ballots?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-8252" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MDM-Definitions.png" alt="" width="320" height="691" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MDM-Definitions.png 472w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MDM-Definitions-139x300.png 139w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" />What these questions assume is that running an election is simple—but that’s simply not true. Whether your state uses all-mail elections or prioritizes in-person voting, elections are complex, and that’s often a good thing, especially when it comes to security.</p>
<p>Before you can explain the ins and outs of your state’s elections system to constituents, you’ll want to take your elections knowledge from the 100 level to 200-plus. One of the best ways to do that is to tour your local elections office(s). You’ll learn from the experts how your state’s elections are managed and get the information you need to respond to constituents’ questions. Plus, you’ll strengthen your relationship with your local election officials—and that can pay off down the road when crafting election legislation.</p>
<p><strong>2 — Be an Advocate for Your State’s Elections</strong><br />
You might not love everything about your state’s elections system, but that doesn’t mean it’s fatally flawed. Every state has mechanisms in place to ensure security and accuracy, and highlighting those features in your state can create a powerful defense against MDM.</p>
<p>Recent<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aap9559"> research</a> has found that MDM spreads faster in online environments than the truth. One way to mitigate that is through “<a href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/global-vaccination-badnews/">pre-bunking</a>,” preempting MDM by correcting (or “debunking”) false claims in advance. The<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol"> rumor control guide</a> from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) offers examples for pre-bunking election MDM.</p>
<p>Sometimes constituents raise concerns about how another state runs elections. Kim Wyman, CISA’S senior election security advisor and former Washington secretary of state, cautions against the “Our state’s elections are good, but I’m not so sure about others” attitude—such narratives sow doubt in elections more broadly.</p>
<p>Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett handles such comparative questions by emphasizing federalism: “Other states have all adopted the policies that work for them, and they’re working just as hard as we are to follow their law and to count every vote accurately.”</p>
<p><strong>3 — Amplify Other Experts</strong><br />
Having all the answers is hard; fortunately, you don’t need to. Election officials and their websites are readily available resources that can answer many constituent questions.</p>
<p>In 2019, the National Association of Secretaries of State launched a<a href="https://www.nass.org/initiatives/trustedinfo"> public information campaign</a> to promote election officials as trusted sources of information. Sharing voter information directly from your state and local election offices and using the campaign’s hashtag, #TrustedInfo2022, on social media can help voters go directly to election officials, rather than to your office (or worse, purveyors of MDM), when they have questions about polling place locations, how to request an absentee ballot and more. (The<a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/national-association-of-election-officials/election-administration-news/Trusted-Info-Supporter-Toolkit-2022.pdf"> TrustedInfo2022 Supporter Toolkit</a> offers sample social media content.)</p>
<p>Supporting local election officials and poll workers can also build confidence in elections and those who run them. “These election judges are your neighbors, your community members,” Koppes says, “and they’re taking time out of their lives to contribute to our living and breathing government.”</p>
<p><strong>4 — Chose Your Words Thoughtfully</strong><br />
With 50 states, Washington, D.C., and five territories each running elections with varying terminology, it’s no surprise that voters often get confused. “Advance ballots,” “mail ballots,” “by-mail ballots,” “mail-in ballots,” “vote-by-mail ballots”—all are phrases used to refer to absentee ballots, for example. (See NCSL’s note on terminology in<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx"> Voting Outside the Polling Place</a>.) When talking about elections, try to be consistent with what your state’s election offices use—making terminology consistent between state law and everyday practice could be good too.</p>
<p>Beyond consistency, the words you use matter. For example, Tammy Smith, the administrator of elections in Wilson County, Tenn., urges legislators to say “remove from the voter rolls” rather than “purge” when referring to<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-list-accuracy.aspx"> voter registration list maintenance</a>. After all, keeping voter registration rolls accurate and current is an important part of an efficient and secure election; the negative connotation of “purge” can cast doubt on a routine process.</p>
<p>It can also be alienating to use technical jargon that voters might not understand, and thus might not trust. “Bring it down to the fifth-grade level,” Koppes says.</p>
<p><strong>5 — Chose Your Tone Thoughtfully</strong><br />
Tennessee Rep. Tim Rudd (R) puts it plainly: “Don’t mock people.” Even if a constituent’s concerns strike you as ridiculous, ridicule won’t be a productive response. “Listen to them, let them get it out, and then see what you can work on together,” he says.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7615" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Sometimes, constituents might not know what your state’s laws are—that you do in fact prohibit voting machines from being connected to the internet, for example. Koppes encourages legislators and others to “show people the laws.” That way, they don’t need to just take your word, and doing so might establish common ground on which you can have a calm conversation based on the facts in your state.</p>
<p><strong>6 — Encourage Constituents to Get Involved</strong><br />
People can learn a lot about how elections are run and what safeguards are built into the process by serving as<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-poll-workers637018267.aspx"> poll workers</a>. So when constituents reach out to you seeking information during election season, urge them to sign up. Being a poll worker is a great way to learn the nuts and bolts of elections—plus, poll workers get paid, and in some states, attorneys, realtors and accountants can receive continuing education credit.</p>
<p>What about people who want to be<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/poll-watcher-qualifications.aspx"> poll watchers</a>? “Encourage people who want to be poll watchers to be poll workers,” says Tennessee local election official Smith. After all, election officials often<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/the-canvass-july-2020.aspx"> struggle</a> to recruit enough poll workers, and our elections can’t run—polls can’t open, ballots can’t be counted, voter questions can’t be answered—without them. Plus, poll workers undergo specialized training and can become spokespeople for how elections really work.</p>
<p><strong>7 — Decide When to Engage and When to Abstain</strong><br />
The phone calls, emails, tweets and Facebook messages you receive about elections might seem like a never-ending game of whack-a-mole, and it’s just not possible to respond to every single one. Instead, consider when it will be most meaningful to respond. That concerned constituent who lingers after your town hall? Yes, definitely. That Twitter user with six followers? Probably not.</p>
<p>Having a litmus test for what’s worth your time and effort can help you manage multiple priorities, but it can also help squash the spread of MDM. “You don’t want to amplify the small things,” as Hargett says, so responding to a troll—even with a smart debunk—might be counterproductive.</p>
<p>In short, addressing election MDM is not easy, and legislators will need to find the style, stories and substance that work best for them and their constituents.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hhh.umn.edu/election-administration/election-accuracy-going-offensive">Election Accuracy: Going on the Offensive</a>: Local and state election officials in the United States — who run the most accurate and secure voting process in the world — are finding that facts are not a sufficient defense of their election outcomes. Despite the rigorous steps that protect voter registration, ballot distribution, election systems and vote counting, conspiracy theories are undermining the public&#8217;s trust in this most basic act of a democracy. To combat this problem, experts from around the nation analyze the problem to provide actionable steps so election administrators can go on the offense to manage communications before, during and after an election.

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5435" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VBM3.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />U.S. Postal Service News:</strong> In an interview with The Washington Post this week, Post Master General Louis DeJoy said that the U.S. Postal Service would<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/04/12/usps-dejoy-midterms-electric-trucks/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter"> work to expedite ballots</a> during the 2022 election cycle. From the article: Let’s talk about voting by mail. Will the Postal Service commit to using the same<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/11/02/usps-ballots-court-ruling/?itid=lk_inline_manual_36"> “extraordinary measures”</a> — dedicated ballot-expediting procedures — in the 2022 midterm elections that it used in elections in 2020 and in 2021?: The answer is yes. It has never been in question. It’s like you tie your shoes when you walk out the door and then you see a judge who says, ‘You must tie your shoes in the future.’ It was kind of a ridiculous accusation. And listen, that’s not me. That was the organization that was here before. Now I may have aligned the network, had more meetings, done a little more stuff. And when you look at all the changes I’m making, I’m one person. I didn’t bring in outside consultants. This is internal postal genetics. So we always use the extraordinary measures. We don’t need a judge to tell us, we don’t need a nonprofit to tell us. We use our best efforts to make sure every ballot that we get our hands on will get delivered. We have done it. It shows in the results. So we’ll continue to do that.” The Biden budget wants to give the Postal Service $5 billion for mail-in voting to make ballots postage free, reduce certain election-related costs and more. Do you want that money? Do you need that money? “We are interested in, to the extent that the states can standardize and use first-class mail and so on and so forth, I think it creates more reliability. We’re the most consistent thing in voting by mail. Everybody else changes rules every year. We’ve been pretty stable in that regard. But we don’t advocate for anything in that regard. This is the nation’s policy.”</p>

It either doesn’t exist or it’s shockingly outdated.” The proposed $80 million will not include funds from Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan. The <a href="https://www.electionexcellence.org/">U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence</a> is a nonpartisan collaborative bringing together election officials, designers and technology experts to support U.S. elections. It is led by the Center for Tech and Civic Life, and its partners include the Center for Civic Design, the Center for Secure and Modern Elections, the Elections Group, Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University, the Prototyping Systems Lab at the University of California at Davis and U.S. Digital Response. Its funding comes through the Audacious Project, a TED initiative that brings together social entrepreneurs with private donors. The alliance was one of five such initiatives debuted Monday at TED 2022.</p>

Advocacy groups such as the League of Women Voters and Common Cause stopped by elections offices throughout the country to say thank you to elections staff. In<a href="https://knox.villagesoup.com/2022/04/12/thanking-election-heroes-at-the-camden-town-office/"> Camden, Maine</a> the local chapter of the LWV stopped by the town clerk’s office with flowers and small gifts. In<a href="https://wtop.com/montgomery-county/2022/04/appreciation-for-elections-workers-as-marylands-primary-election-season-kicks-off/"> Montgomery County, Maryland</a>, bouquets of flowers in Mason jars filled a table with a poster-sized thank-you card as Kool &amp; the Gang’s “Celebration” blared from a portable speaker Tuesday in the parking lot of the Montgomery County Board of Elections. Nancy Soreng, co-president of the League of Women Voters of Maryland, led a cheer: “Election heroes! We love you!” Common Cause<a href="https://ladailypost.com/common-cause-new-mexico-thanks-state-election-officials-poll-workers-volunteers-on-thank-election-day-heroes-day/"> New Mexico</a> participated in the day as well by sending thank you notes to elections officials.  “These officials are no longer just running elections,” Monet Silva, associate director of Common Cause New Mexico said. “They are myth busters, contending with disinformation, standing up for fairness and democracy on the frontlines.” members of 603 Forward came to the<a href="https://manchesterinklink.com/group-thanks-manchester-city-clerks-office-workers/"> Manchester, Vermont</a> City Clerk’s office to give thank you cards and baked goods to election workers. “Election workers are heroes in our communities,” said Matt Mooshian, Claremont City Councilor and 603 Forward Advocacy and Engagement Director. “We are showing our support because of the increasing threats and dangerous rhetoric against the elected officials and volunteers who tirelessly facilitate the bedrock of our democracy: free and fair elections. The hostility posed by right-wing activists who promote election fraud conspiracy theories does not represent how the overwhelming majority of people in communities across our state feel about our elections.

How the pace comes together will play a big part. It&#8217;s a tough decision. He took a big jump in his last start, which was only his third lifetime, so an extra two weeks is appealing (for the May 21 Preakness). But if you are among the top dozen choices for the Derby, which I believe he is, it&#8217;s hard to pass up.&#8221; Brown told BloodHorse that he plans to work Early Voting, giving him two full weeks off since the Wood, which the colt led for the majority of the race only to lose by a neck in the end. We’ll definitely keep you posted.</p>

The &#8220;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-democrats-introduce-bill-requiring-time-off-voting-2022-04-11/">Time Off to Vote Act</a>&#8221; would close gaps in state laws, U.S. Representative Nikema Williams of Georgia said in a statement, citing the long lines at polling places seen in her state and others during previous elections. The new narrow bill would &#8220;ensure no worker has to sacrifice their wages or jeopardize their job security to exercise their sacred right to vote,&#8221; Democratic Representative Andy Levin, a co-sponsor, said in a statement.</p>

If signed into law, Alabama would be the latest state to ban such donations— a movement at least partly fueled by conservatives’ suspicion about donations by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in 2020. The Alabama Senate approved the bill on a 25-7 vote with Republicans in support and Democrats opposed. The bill now goes to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey for her consideration. The bill would make it a misdemeanor for a public official to accept donations, grants and donated services from an individual or a nongovernmental entity to help fund election-related expenses or voter education, voter outreach, or voter registration programs.</p>

If approved by the Senate and Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, the citizenship requirement would take effect after the 2022 election, a concession demanded by a Republican lawmaker who provided the final vote to pass the bill out of the Senate. As it stands now, that requirement and others in a bill signed March 30 will take effect 90 days after the legislative session ends, which is likely to fall between the primary and general election. The update also would make a technical change that appears aimed at addressing concerns that the bill could potentially require hundreds of thousands of people who registered before 2005 to provide proof of their citizenship.</p>

State and local elections officials told the Committee that their workers, from municipal front-office staff to county clerks to the state’s highest-ranking elections officials, have experienced an escalation of threats since the 2020 presidential election. The threats — delivered by email, phone, or by the posting on social media of home addresses of workers and their family members — have left some local authorities confronting staff shortages ahead of Colorado’s June primaries and the November midterms. Crafted with the input of prosecutors and the Colorado County Clerks Association, the bill would allow elections workers to have their personal information, such as home addresses, redacted from public records that could be accessed by others. It also creates a misdemeanor crime for anyone using personal information to threaten or influence elections workers, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or a jail term up to 364 days, or both. Threatening or intimidating election officials while they are working or retaliating them because of their work would be punishable by a fine of up to $750 or 120 days in jail, or both. The committee advanced the legislation for consideration by the full House on an 8-2 bipartisan vote.</p>
<p>Gov. Jared Polis has signed a state bill that helps<a href="https://kdvr.com/news/local/colorado-disaster-victim-voting-law/"> solidify the voting rights</a> of a select minority facing a litany of rebuilding challenges. Polis signed<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb22-152"> SB22-152</a> into law. It allows Marshall Fire victims who are already registered as Colorado voters, and who are planning to return to their currently uninhabitable properties, to use those addresses to vote. “This law offers voters displaced by the fire the peace of mind that they will still be able to easily cast their ballot in their communities,” said Rep. Tracey Bernett, D-Louisville. According to the new law, the address that displaced victims use for vehicle registration, as well as for tax purposes, does not need to match the address used for voting purposes. This applies to both renters and homeowners.  When it comes to what this law will do in regard to future disasters and the resulting victims, it extends identical protections for Colorado’s voters displaced by natural disasters that include fires, floods and tornadoes.</p>

In addition to a personal voter&#8217;s illness, it would now apply to a voter taking care of someone else&#8217;s health, such as an ill relative. “This slight change better aligns our state laws with that allowed under the constitution,” Lamont said in a statement. “We should be doing everything we can to encourage qualified voters to cast a ballot, and this is a responsible step forward in that direction.”</p>

Andy Beshear. Beshear said Senate Bill 216 reduces transparency by requiring campaign finance reports from candidates. &#8220;Without quarterly reports, candidates will be able to draft bills and serve on interim legislative committees, while receiving donations in secret,&#8221; Beshear said.. The measure passed with bipartisan support. The Legislature<a href="https://www.wpsdlocal6.com/news/kentucky-lawmakers-override-series-of-gubernatorial-vetoes/article_d642cd78-bb8d-11ec-89f9-33606e4e864f.html"> voted to overturn Beshear’s veto</a>. “I am grateful to the General Assembly for overriding the Governor’s veto of Senate Bill 216. This new law expands our post-election audit process; places our voting machines under video surveillance during non-voting hours of election periods; and accomplishes full transition to paper ballots during my term of office. These common-sense reforms will improve not only our election process, but also public confidence in our elections,” Secretary of State Michael Adams said.</p>
<p>Beshear did sign House Bill 564 into law. The new law<a href="https://foxlexington.com/news/kentucky/early-voting-expansion-approved-as-beshear-vetoes-paper-ballot-bill/"> expands early voting</a> in and guarantees protections for poll workers. Adams said this law added the clarity needed to ensure all polling places are open at least 8 hours for early voting including a Saturday. The bill also makes it a felony under Kentucky law to threaten election workers.</p>

Janet Mills for consideration. The legislation, which was approved by the state Senate, will make it a misdemeanor for anyone to interfere &#8220;by force, violence, intimidation or any physical act&#8221; with a state, county or local election official in the performance of their duty. The House of Representatives previously approved the measure. The bill&#8217;s primary sponsor, Rep. Bruce White, D-Waterville, said he filed the measure in response to an &#8220;alarming increase in the number of death threats and violence made against election workers and officials across the country – including here in our home state.&#8221; The legislation is also backed by Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who has also cited a rise in documented threats against the election officials throughout the country. Originally, the legislation called for making it a felony to interfere with the election officials, but lawmakers scaled it back to a misdemeanor charge during committee hearings on the bill. A fiscal note attached to the bill estimated that the changes won&#8217;t require additional funding from the state but could increase the amount of money from fines if people are charged with violating the proposed law.</p>

Republicans in the Senate passed<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/pdf.aspx?id=33850&amp;q=billVersion"> SB 418</a> in March, contending it would tamp down on unverified voters participating in New Hampshire elections, despite any evidence of widespread participation by residents of other states casting ballots in the state. Opponents say the measure would sow confusion into the process and potentially violates the state constitution. Under the plan, voters who don’t have proper identification would cast a newly created affidavit ballot, which would be numbered and traceable by election officials. Voters would then have 10 days to mail necessary documentation to the Secretary of State’s office to prove their eligibility, or their ballots would be scrapped and the final results amended. Under current state law, voters who don’t have proper identification to prove their citizenship, identity and age may cast a ballot if they sign an affidavit swearing to their eligibility to vote in New Hampshire, with potential legal penalties and fines for fraudulent submissions. The House Election Law committee<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-house-controversial-provisional-ballot-bill-41322/39720508"> slimmed down the legislation</a> that would create a provisional ballot in New Hampshire’s election system. Now, a small number of ballots will be targeted. The concern over military voters remains an issue. Democrats said they could not support the bill because the review time for provisional ballots could mean those overseas votes don&#8217;t arrive by election day.</p>
<p>The Senate is set to pass a bill aimed at<a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/briefs/senate-poised-to-pass-voter-registration-assistance-for-students-with-disabilities/"> helping students with disabilities register to vote</a>.<a href="http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=1403&amp;inflect=2"> House Bill 1594</a> proposes to do that by including voter registration in a student’s plan of study for those students who are already following an individualized education program. Rep. Mark Paige, an Exeter Democrat and the bill’s prime sponsor, said it uses a framework that is already in place for students with disabilities to ensure voter registration is addressed before graduation. Supporters say the bill is needed because students with disabilities may pursue a separate curriculum from their peers, and could miss civics education and feel unwelcome from participating in civic society.  The bill also has the support of the Disability Rights Center, ABLE NH, and at least one educator. At a hearing this month, 91 people registered in support of the bill and three in opposition. The bill has received bipartisan support in both House and Senate committees. The Senate Education Committee unanimously recommended the bill pass into law and put it on the consent calendar for Thursday, which means it could pass the Senate floor without debate.</p>

Theresa Gavarone, R-Huron, would require people voting in-person to show a photo ID. Those voting by mail would need to provide the last four digits of their Social Security number and either the number or a photocopy of their Ohio driver&#8217;s license or state ID. The bill would also allow Ohioans ages 17 and up to get a free state ID.  A spokesman for Secretary of State Frank LaRose said his team is reviewing the proposal. If passed, Ohio voters would no longer be able to use utility bills, paychecks or other forms of ID currently permitted under state law.</p>
<p>Rep. Ron Ferguson has filed a bill that would<a href="https://wtov9.com/news/local/ferguson-proposing-bill-to-pay-for-possible-second-ohio-primary"> help local election authorities cover the costs</a> of two primaries in Ohio. &#8220;That cost, actually, would fall on the counties,” Ferguson said. “If we don&#8217;t take initiative here at the state level to pay for it. It&#8217;s not fair to the counties. So, I&#8217;ve actually reached out to the local county commissioners. Spoken to Tony Morelli, J.P. Dutton and Mick Schumacher in Jefferson, Belmont and Monroe counties. I told them that what I am proposing to do is take money from the Ohio Supreme Court budget and reallocate it to this election so that counties aren&#8217;t footing the bill.” Across the state, the cost of a proposed August primary is estimated by Secretary of State Frank LaRose at $20 to $25 million. Ferguson said, locally, the costs vary from about $35,000 for Monroe County to $140,000 in Belmont County.</p>

The upper chamber voted 29-20 along party lines to approve the GOP-authored bill requiring voters who don’t return mail-in ballots through the U.S. Postal Service to deliver them to their county elections office instead of depositing them into a drop box. The bill now goes to the House of Representatives. “The ballots are called mail-in ballots — not drop box ballots,” Sen. Cris Dush, R-Jefferson, the bill’s author, said on the Senate floor. First used in the 2020 primary election, ballot drop boxes have faced criticism from legislative Republicans, who accused the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of overstepping its constitutional authority by authorizing their use without approval from the General Assembly. Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, R-Centre, and Senate Majority Leader Kim Ward, R-Westmoreland, argued that the legislation aims to reinstill faith in the electoral process and allow the General Assembly to decide whether to implement ballot drop boxes. “If you want drop boxes, put in legislation for drop boxes — not saying it’s going to pass, but it would be the proper channel,” Ward said.</p>
<p>Legislation intended to allow the state’s election officials to<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2022/04/13/legislative-fix-proposed-to-improve-removal-of-deceased-from-pa-s-voter-rolls/stories/202204130118"> use more sources of information to clear voter rolls of dead people</a> won unanimous approval in the House State Government Committee. The bipartisan bill grants election officials the authority to utilize more official data sources such as the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, to ensure voter rolls are up to date. Pennsylvania, although a member of ERIC since 2015, has not fully used its resources due to limitations outlined in the state’s election code, said Pennsylvania Department of State Deputy Secretary of Elections and Commission Jonathan Marks. Marks told the committee last week that the state’s election code is very prescriptive about what tools counties can use to removed deceased voters from voting rolls, namely newspaper obituaries and letters issued by county registrars of will. He said the department would welcome the opportunity to more fully utilize ERIC to maintain the accuracy of county voter rolls. It has found that data helpful to pick up changes of address and eliminate duplicate registrations that arise from people relocating to different towns and states, Marks said.</p>

The bill,<a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2022/S.265"> S.265</a>, makes it illegal to threaten an individual or group of people in a way that causes reasonable fear of death, serious injury or sexual assault. If the target of the threat is an election worker, holds public office, is a candidate for public office or is a public employee, there is a heightened penalty — up to two years in prison, a $2,000 fine or both.  The fine is also $2,000 if the threat would intimidate the target in a school, at the Statehouse, in a place of worship or at a polling place.  In other instances, the maximum penalty would be one year in prison, a $1,000 fine or both. In all cases, the charge is a misdemeanor.</p>
<p>The House gave initial approval to a Burlington charter change via voice vote.<a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2022/H.744"> H.744</a> would establish<a href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/04/07/burlingtons-just-cause-eviction-ranked-choice-voting-efforts-notch-wins-in-montpelier%EF%BF%BC/"> ranked choice voting</a> for city council elections.  Passed by Burlington voters on Town Meeting Day in 2021, the charter change would resurrect in part the city’s former method of tabulating election results. Under the ranked choice model, voters list their candidates in order of preference. If no candidate gets a majority of first-place votes, the tally factors in second-choice votes (or third, or fourth) until one candidate claims a majority. Rep. Jim Harrison, R-Chittenden, expressed concern that the measure would lessen the uniformity of voting systems around Vermont.  “Some of us have been concerned about consistency through our state in terms of voting laws, and this, it seems to me, goes the opposite direction,” Chittenden said.  But Rep. Laura Sibilia, I-Dover, said the change was good for Burlington’s civic health, because it would elect candidates who were top-of-mind for the highest number of voters.</p>

One<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2021/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb942"> bill</a> vetoed by Evers would have given the Legislature&#8217;s budget committee the ability to withhold funding and cut jobs from the bipartisan state Elections Commission and other agencies if lawmakers determined they didn&#8217;t follow election laws or provided incorrect guidance to local officials. A<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2021/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb941"> similar bill</a> Evers vetoed would have allowed the budget committee to block federal funding to the commission if lawmakers opposed how it planned to spend it.  That bill also would have let lawmakers from each political party select attorneys for the commissioners. Now, the commission of three Republicans and three Democrats are given nonpartisan attorneys. <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2021/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb935"> Another bill</a> Evers blocked would have banned election officials from accepting grants from private entities to help them run their elections. That bill also would have put new rules in place for voting at nursing homes during health emergencies. The legislation Evers vetoed would have allowed nursing home workers to assist with voting during a pandemic if special voting deputies could not visit the facilities. The legislation would have required most confined voters to provide a copy of an ID or the number on their state ID or driver&#8217;s license. Those who didn&#8217;t have an ID could have provided the last four digits of their Social Security number and a signed statement from another U.S. citizen affirming their identity. Other bills vetoed by Evers would have:<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2021/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb938"> required</a> the state to conduct checks to ensure those on the voter rolls are United States citizens; <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2021/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb939">required</a> most voters to provide a copy of a photo ID every time they request an absentee ballot (instead of just the first time); and<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2021/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb940"> required</a> election officials to label voters as ineligible to vote if the information on the voter rolls did not match their driver&#8217;s licenses. Other vetoed bills would have<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2021/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb943"> given</a> a legislative committee a greater say in the guidance the Elections Commission gives to local officials and<a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2021/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb945"> required courts</a> to alert election officials when people called to jury duty reported that they are not U.S. citizens.</p>

Ron DeSantis, Attorney General Ashley Moody, and national Republican groups filed a notice that they<a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2022/04/09/florida-to-appeal-elections-ruling/"> will appeal a federal judge’s ruling</a> that parts of a sweeping elections law were intended to discriminate against Black Floridians. Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker’s March 31 decision came in a lawsuit challenging a 2021 law imposing new restrictions on mail-in voting and third-party voter registration organizations. DeSantis and Republican legislative leaders quickly slammed the judge’s decision and vowed to appeal the ruling to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Speaking to reporters following Walker’s ruling, the governor said the judge’s decision was not unexpected and predicted it would be overturned by the Atlanta-based appeals court. “It was not unforeseen because we typically set our clocks to getting a partisan outcome in that court,” DeSantis said on April 1. “I would not want to be on the receiving end of that appeal if I were a judge, because I think that that’s going to be reversed on appeal. The only question is how quickly it gets reversed on appeal. But it’s not going to be able to withstand appellate scrutiny.”</p>

The case has been building for 3 1/2 years since it was filed by Fair Fight Action, a group Democrat Stacey Abrams founded following her loss to Republican Brian Kemp in the 2018 election for governor. Now it will be decided by a judge as both candidates are running again. The lawsuit targets Georgia’s “exact match” voter registration rules and inconsistent absentee ballot cancellation practices, which the plaintiffs say created difficulties that disproportionately affected Black voters. The defendants in the case — Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and state election officials — say they’ve already defeated many of the claims in earlier court rulings, leaving a narrow and flimsy case. The trial could last about a month and feature dozens of witnesses, including dismayed voters, election officials and preachers. Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock is expected to testify by video.</p>

The League of Women Voters Kansas, Loud Light, Kansas Appleseed and Topeka Independent Living Resource Center are asking the Kansas Court of Appeals for an injunction against provisions in<a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2021_22/measures/hb2183/"> HB 2183</a> they contend criminalize voter registration drives. Hal Brewster, attorney for the plaintiffs, said the groups have stopped much of their work out of fear of prosecution. &#8220;The other night when KU cut down the nets in New Orleans and there was a party like you&#8217;ve never seen on Mass Street in Lawrence, Loud Light should have been out there registering voters, and they weren&#8217;t,&#8221; Brewster said. &#8220;They weren&#8217;t there because they thought they would get prosecuted. And that is in a county where the DA has said she&#8217;s not going to prosecute because it&#8217;s unconstitutional.&#8221; Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Attorney General Derek Schmidt are the defendants in the case.  The legal challenge focuses on a piece of the bill that criminalizes the impersonation of an election official, including conduct that gives the appearance of being an election official or causes someone to believe that. The Legislature overrode Gov. Laura Kelly&#8217;s veto of the bill last session. In addition to the impersonation crime, it contained provisions related to mail ballot postmarks, advance ballot signatures, deadlines, voter registration reports, delivery of advance ballots, electioneering and election office funding. Some of those provisions are being challenged in the lawsuit but are not the subject of the injunction request. Shawnee County District Court Judge Teresa Watson has<a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/04/12/litigants-file-appeal-of-kansas-judges-dismissal-of-lawsuit-challenging-election-restrictions/"> dismissed the lawsuit</a>.</p>

Guidry made the decision after an afternoon of testimony in district court, declaring the March 26 Sulphur City Council race null and void. The new election will be June 4, with early voting May 21 through 28. The council race was marred when some voters were not placed into the correct district after recent redistricting. Calcasieu Registrar of Voters Kim Fontenot took the stand, admitting she made a mistake &#8211; 30 people were initially left off the voting list for District 2 and two people voted who should not have. Fontenot was questioned at length about changes in district lines. Attorneys for the winning candidate argued that the affected voters would not make up for the difference in votes but Guidry found the irregularities were substantial and that calling voters turned away and inviting them back was not a suitable remedy.</p>

The ruling allows the new districts for electing members of the General Assembly to go into effect for the July 19 primary elections without further delay. The filing deadline for candidates wishing to appear on the ballot is Friday at 9 p.m. The court issued a five-page order and said it will give its reasons later in an opinion. About four hours before the ruling was made public, the lawyers seeking to overturn the new legislative districts appeared before the Court of Appeals to ask that it reject Wilner’s recommendations and strike down the map. A panel of seven judges heard the case, one via video. Elections officials had warned in a legal filing that a Court of Appeals decision throwing out the legislative maps would leave them too little time to implement any changes before the July primary. The State Board of Elections also warned that postponing the primary later than Aug. 16 would endanger plans for the Nov. 8 general election.</p>

The ruling essentially hands the decision about the constitutionality of the redistricting plan over to a higher court, while creating one possible contingency for keeping the elections on schedule.  New York&#8217;s primary season was potentially upended last week when Judge Patrick McAllister, a Republican trial judge, declared that new political district maps heavily favoring Democrats had been drawn up illegally. He ordered the Legislature to quickly redraw the district boundaries, or he would appoint a neutral expert to do it for them. That ruling has been put on hold while the state appeals. An appeals court panel has scheduled another hearing for April 20. The case could ultimately be decided by New York&#8217;s highest court, the Court of Appeals. The primary has been scheduled for June 28.  In his ruling, Lindley said he would allow McAllister to retain a neutral expert to draw up a new congressional map, if he wishes to do so, to be used if the Legislature&#8217;s maps are eventually struck down.</p>

Butler also declined to restrain the Election Commission from implementing a resolution opening just its downtown location on the first two days of early voting, which begins April 13, then five other sites (the Agricenter, Arlington Safe Room, Baker Community Center, Dave Wells Community Center and Glenview Community Center) on the fourth day of early voting. No other sites will be open until April 18, 2022, for the May 2022 primaries. “The question is, do I disrupt the entire Shelby County election based on what I’ve heard at this point?&#8221; Butler asked. &#8220;And the court is not prepared to do that.” Butler determined that he had heard insufficient proof to determine that the Election Commission had violated the Tennessee Open Meetings Act or the Tennessee Constitution.</p>

At issue is whether the Wisconsin Elections Commission can distribute guidance around policies like drop boxes without going through a more-robust rulemaking process that involves legislative oversight, and whether pandemic-era guidance that the WEC provided is consistent with existing state law. “I think that [WEC guidances] have the force of law, not by requiring clerks to do this, because WEC didn’t require them to do drop boxes, but WEC authorized them to do drop boxes,” said Rick Esenberg, the lawyer for the plaintiffs challenging the WEC drop box guidance. Also before the court was the question of who can return an absentee ballot. During the pandemic, the WEC rejected a proposal by Esenberg’s Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty that would have limited who can return an absentee ballot to only the voter that cast that ballot. Esenberg argued in court Wednesday that state law requires voters to cast the ballot themselves — whether by feeding the voting machine with their ballot on election day or returning an absentee ballot in the mail. Disability advocates say however, this will overtly disenfranchise a group of voters. “They suggest that every voter is able to mail their own ballot, place it in the mailbox or return it to their clerk if they try hard enough — that is offensive and it is false,” said Barbara Beckert of Disability Rights Wisconsin in a news conference after the oral arguments. “[Some voters] may</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.rstreet.org/event/best-practices-for-election-audits/">Best Practices for Election Audits</a>: Properly administered election audits are one of the most important tools states can use to improve voter confidence and election security. In 2020, however, state legislatures in multiple states used audits for the opposite goal of undermining the public’s faith in elections and the electoral results themselves. Join us on April 14, as representatives from the Brennan Center for Justice and the R Street Institute discuss the audits that followed the last election cycle and explore options to strengthen oversight of our elections going forward. This virtual panel discussion is hosted by Wayne Law’s Voting Rights and Election Law Society and the Levin Center at Wayne Law. <strong>When:</strong> April 14, 12:15pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eac.gov/events/2022/04/14/2022-eac-standards-board-annual-meeting">2022 EAC Standards Board Annual Meeting</a>: The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) Standards Board will hold their 2022 Annual Meeting primarily to discuss next steps regarding the VVSG 2.0 Requirements and implementation, the status of the EAC&#8217;s e-poll book pilot program, and supply chain issues affecting the 2022 midterm elections. This meeting will include a question-and-answer discussion between board members and EAC staff. Board members will also review FACA Board membership guidelines and policies with EAC Acting General Counsel and receive a general update about the EAC programming. The Board will also elect two new members to the Executive Board Committee. <strong>When:</strong> April 14, 1:30pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/event/beyond-winner-take-all-possibilities-proportional-voting-united-states">Beyond Winner-Take-All: Possibilities for Proportional Voting in the United States</a>: At a time when many are rightly concerned about the health of American democracy, scholars and reformers are evaluating proposals to make democracy more functional and representative. One such proposal is to move beyond the winner-take-all electoral system used at the federal and state levels in the United States to enable adoption of proportional voting systems. What would be the impact of proportional voting in the United States, and what will it take to enact it?  Join panelists Rob Richie, President and CEO of FairVote, Rebecca Chavez-Houck, Community Engagement Consultant and Former Utah State Legislator, and Danielle Allen, James Bryant Conant University Professor at Harvard University in discussion. Archon Fung, Winthrop Laflin McCormack Professor of Citizenship and Self-Government at Harvard Kennedy School, Director of the Ash Center&#8217;s Democratic Governance Programs, will moderate. <strong>When:</strong> April 19, 4pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hhh.umn.edu/election-administration/election-accuracy-going-offensive">Election Accuracy: Going on the Offensive</a>: Local and state election officials in the United States — who run the most accurate and secure voting process in the world — are finding that facts are not a sufficient defense of their election outcomes. Despite the rigorous steps that protect voter registration, ballot distribution, election systems and vote counting, conspiracy theories are undermining the public&#8217;s trust in this most basic act of a democracy. To combat this problem, experts from around the nation analyze the problem to provide actionable steps so election administrators can go on the offense to manage communications before, during and after an election. Hosted by the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. 9am to 12:30pm Central. <strong>Where:</strong> Online. <strong>When:</strong> April 22.</p>
