														<p><strong>Exit Interview: David Beirne</strong><br />
<em>Long-time FVAP director set to move on to new DoD role</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-4315" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Beirneheadshot_20161219-282x300.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="326" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Beirneheadshot_20161219-282x300.jpg 282w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Beirneheadshot_20161219-768x816.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Beirneheadshot_20161219-964x1024.jpg 964w" sizes="(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px" />Like many people in the field, David Beirne didn’t set out to be an elections official. Following college graduation he was looking for a job in city or town management, but like many college graduates, when that didn’t pan out quickly enough and rent was due so-to-speak, Beirne took a job elsewhere.</p>
<p>That job was in the<a href="https://www.browardvotes.gov/"> Broward County, Florida Supervisor of Elections Office</a> and the rest, as they like to say, is history.</p>
<p>Now, after more than three decades in the elections field, including the last 12 years with the<a href="https://www.fvap.gov/"> Federal Voting Assistance Program</a> (FVAP), Beirne is moving on to another, non-elections role at the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Before joining FVAP, Beirne worked in election administration in Florida and Texas. He served as an assistant to the supervisor of elections in Broward County, an election administrator in <a href="https://www.fortbendcountytx.gov/government/departments/elections-voter-registration">Fort Bend County, Texas</a> and as director of public affairs for the <a href="https://www.harrisvotes.com/">Harris County, Texas</a> clerk.</p>
<p>“As a member of the<a href="https://ovi.csg.org/"> Council of State Governments Overseas Voting Initiative</a>, I have had the pleasure of working with Director Beirne for several years. His professionalism and wealth of knowledge has made him a tremendous asset to FVAP and OVI, and his sardonic witticisms have always brought levity to a very important subject matter,” said Barb Bynum,<a href="https://clerk.ingham.org/departments_and_officials/county_clerk/"> Ingham County, Michigan</a> clerk. “I appreciated the previous election administration experience he brought to the table and to effectively communicate the military perspective to the election administrators on the task force. He is leaving big shoes to fill at FVAP, but I wish him well in all of his future endeavors and hope our paths cross again in the future.”</p>
<p>Following stints in local elections, Beirn next became the executive director of the Election Technology Council (ETC). As executive director of ETC, he worked on behalf of election industry members to educate federal and state governments, legislators, and other voting community constituents to address issues facing the industry. Beirne also operated his own strategic consulting business focused on election administration, national policy and communications.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-8362 alignright" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-12-at-11.38.47-AM-300x73.png" alt="" width="300" height="73" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-12-at-11.38.47-AM-300x73.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-12-at-11.38.47-AM.png 710w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Beirne joined FVAP in 2010 and served in various capacities spanning the organization, including Director of Voting Assistance and Deputy Director of Technology Programs.</p>
<p>“As a former local election official in Florida, David brought a unique perspective on the issues facing military and overseas voters to FVAP. I had the opportunity to work closely with David as a member of the Council of State Governments (CSG) Overseas Voting Initiative, which focuses on improving UOCAVA voting through research and data standardization,” said David Stafford, supervisor of elections in<a href="https://escambiavotes.gov/"> Escambia County, Florida</a>. “David also spearheaded the 2016 Military Ballot Tracking Pilot, a successful proof of concept project involving our office and five other local election jurisdictions, FVAP, CSG, the United States Postal Service and the Military Postal Service Agency. HIs focus has always been on what is best for military and overseas voters, and how FVAP can help the local election officials who serve them. David’s steady hand will be missed. I wish him all the best in his new role.</p>
<p><em><strong>What made you choose to work in local government and how specifically did you end up working in election administration after college?<br />
</strong></em>First off, the opportunity to conduct an exit interview with Electionline is an honor since I can still recall the first time I visited the website and how often I continued to visit the daily news section for the latest topics and trends.  Actually, I fell into elections completely by accident. I originally pursued a career in city and town management, but after failing to secure immediate employment, I applied for a mail clerk position with the Broward County, Florida Supervisor of Elections office.  I was quickly promoted to the front office and worked closely with Jane Carroll, a legend in the election space.</p>
<p>During my time in Broward, the 2000 election represented my first presidential election experience which remained with me and guided my approach as I observed the level of scrutiny election officials need to prepare for each and every day. After that, election administration took root as a field of interest and has allowed me countless opportunities to learn and serve while advancing my career.</p>
<p>I would be remiss not to point out that I’ve been very fortunate to work with two very strong women in the field of elections, Jane Carroll, the retired Broward County Supervisor of Elections, and Beverly Kaufman, the former Harris County Clerk.  Both of them taught me a number of lessons that remain with me to this day.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tell us about the program that the DoD is sending you to. We have all heard of the Naval War College (but do not necessarily know what it is!). Tell us about the program you are in now through the DoD, how long it will take and what happens after you complete the program.<br />
</strong></em>The Department of Defense program I have been accepted into is called the Defense Senior Leadership Development Program (DSLDP). DSLDP is a competitive program administered through the DoD that “develops senior civilian leaders to support the needs of the 21st century through a joint, interagency and multi-national environment.”  Essentially, the curriculum consists of professional military education through attendance at the Army War College, College of Naval Warfare, Air War College, or National Defense University (National War College or Eisenhower School) followed by a new 10-month experiential work assignment.</p>
<p>In the summer, I will report to the National Defense University-Eisenhower School for approximately 10 months of study, followed by another assignment within the federal government.  The curriculum and work assignment are intended to offer opportunities for career broadening and to expanding my view beyond the world of election administration.  I will graduate from the program with a Master of Science in National Resource Strategy in June 2023 and look to complete the DLSDP in August of 2024.</p>
<p>I am very excited and thankful for this opportunity and the support I continue to receive from my leadership.</p>
<p><em><strong>You’ve had wide-ranging experience in the election community – local election official, voting technology representative, consultant and now federal employee … how do you see that background assisting you as you prepare to embark on the Eisenhower School program?<br />
</strong></em>I think my overall range of experiences provide a unique perspective for the Department.  Election administration and remains highly visible both for the media and as part of the national dialogue.  The intense scrutiny and zero sum aspects provide very little margin for error.  After all, your most seasoned election official may only have 5 Presidential election cycles in their career.  I think my involvement in elections have given me experience in the areas of project management, policy development and implementation, but also the ability to think strategically.  All of these skills are critical in the Department of Defense, especially in the areas that directly support the warfighter and their overall readiness.</p>
<p>I also think election administrators understand the need to remain nonpartisan at all times.  At its very core, election administration is one area of government that demonstrates the need for separation of politics from administration, the very dichotomy in play in the field of public administration. My hope is that the DSLDP will enhance my core skills, but also identify other areas within the Department that these same skills may be used to continue to support our military and their families.</p>
<p><em><strong>How has the FVAP Director role changed since you first started with the organization?</strong></em><br />
I joined the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) in 2010 and at that time FVAP’s personnel surged to approximately 32 individuals in response to passage of the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment (MOVE) Act in 2009.  Since that time, responsibilities of the FVAP Director have remained the same and FVAP matured its operations to gain efficiencies. We continue to augment our staff with contractor support and other temporary personnel during peak periods of election activity, but I take a lot of pride in applying efficiencies in the federal space and perhaps dispelling myths about federal agencies.  It seems that some would prefer for FVAP to have more of an advocacy role, but the role of the FVAP Director remains solely focused on administering program activities and leaving overarching policies to the states and to legislators.</p>
<p><em><strong>Surveys are now a huge part of how FVAP gains insight; what have you learned about asking questions of your voters or stakeholders? What answers have surprised you the most?<br />
</strong></em>FVAP continues to rely on surveys to meet its Congressional reporting requirements for assessing program effectiveness and measuring overall military and overseas citizen registration and participation rates.  I think the one item that may have shifted in the last few years is the increased level that FVAP takes to actively apply its survey findings not just to meet its reporting requirements, but to understand more about its customers.  The ability for FVAP to assess and report an overseas participation rate was a very difficult sausage-making exercise, and it only came about from coming up with a viable strategy to survey overseas citizens like we do our active duty military personnel.  The net result of these surveys is that we now have a better snapshot on how these two broad customer groups differ in age, demographics and access to the voting process.  I think the biggest surprise to me is the level of complexity and rigor that goes into our survey program overall.  Our research portfolio is not an easy undertaking and requires a good partnership between FVAP staff, other DoD offices, and our contractors.</p>
<p><em><strong>What should your staff be most proud of overcoming or achieving?</strong></em><br />
I think both current and former FVAP staff should be most proud of supporting the progress FVAP demonstrated since 2010.  This is especially true when it comes to integrating customer service throughout the program. Through Congressional authorization and Departmental support, FVAP made a substantial investment into its website and the customer experience; applied substantial research and data analysis to our program activities; and leveraged new opportunities to engage directly with state and local election officials through our cooperative agreement with the Council of State Governments and their Overseas Voting Initiative.  These achievements are a result of a total team effort, clear focus, and overall program continuity to build on the foundations established since the MOVE Act amendments to Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA).</p>
<p>The current team at FVAP should be proud of the resiliency demonstrated over the last two years.  I remain humbled to work with a team that remained thoroughly committed during the pandemic.  The staff pulled together and continue to execute FVAP’s mission effectively through their adaptability and overall team cohesion. For that, I will remain forever grateful and impressed.</p>
<p><em><strong>My sister was a UOCAVA voter for more than decade. She always took the time to request and send her ballot back even though she was convinced it never made it/got counted. What advice do you have for people like my sister to instill confidence in the system? Additionally, what would you recommend to local elections officials to help them assuage the concerns of folks like my sister?<br />
</strong></em>FVAP deals with this pervasive myth that ballots returning from overseas military and overseas citizens are not even considered for counting unless the election is close.  We really don’t know where this myth began, but we continue to remind our voters that all ballots received by the published deadlines for each state and territory must be considered for acceptance or rejection.  This myth, and the need to combat it, drove FVAP to conduct the Military Ballot Tracking Pilot in 2016 to provide full ballot tracking of UOCAVA ballots through the United States Postal System domestically and the military postal system for our overseas military.  While election officials continue to focus on the need to assure their voters from a cybersecurity standpoint, I think there is plenty of opportunity to explore ways to foster greater information awareness strategies to improve a general understanding of the election administration process as a “back-to-basics” approach.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you see as your legacy as you leave FVAP work behind? What are FVAP&#8217;s biggest challenges and opportunities as you see them?</strong></em><br />
I don’t like to think in terms of legacy, but I do hope my ten years demonstrates a desire to pursue innovative and creative ideas.  Significant FVAP accomplishments since 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li>completing our research on the electronic voting demonstration project (i.e., internet voting);</li>
<li>fielding a revamped FVAP.gov website;</li>
<li>standardizing our voting content to better support our voting assistance officers; establishing a clear methodology to report overseas citizen registration and participation rates;</li>
<li>establishing voting assistance ambassador positions overseas;</li>
<li>leveraging a new standardized data schema to perhaps reduce the post-election reporting requirements for states</li>
</ul>
<p>I think one challenge for FVAP is to continue to work with states to understand the military environment and encourage them to work with FVAP to refine their proposed solutions, but not look for the Department to solve them.  FVAP raises awareness and supports our military, their families, and overseas citizens with the absentee voting process.  Ultimately, FVAP does what is required under statute and supported by the Department.</p>
<p>I think opportunities exist for discussions with state and local election officials in several areas.  We’ve seen states such as Nevada, Montana, and Maryland authorize the acceptance of digital signatures from the Department of Defense Common Access Card in lieu of a wet signature.  This is a positive trend for those states that already authorize the electronic submission of election materials because it takes into account the operational limitations of our active duty military, but also the current use of digital signatures within Departmental activities.  The acceptance of digital signatures from the Department of Defense Common Access Card negates the need for our military to rely on printers and scanners when completing and returning election materials.</p>
<p>One thing I can most assuredly tell you- FVAP will be in good hands through Scott Wiedmann who will take over as Acting Director in my absence.  He and I shared a common vision throughout our time of service together and I will remain eternally grateful for his support.</p>
<p><em><strong>You share a birthday with a former president, who is that and can you tell us about your chance encounter with the president.</strong></em><br />
During the 2004 General Election, former President George H.W. Bush and the first lady intended to vote early and gave a heads up to the Harris County Clerk responsible for conducting elections in Harris County, Texas.  The former president’s advance team notified us and I was designated as their liaison to minimize impact and disruptions at an early voting location in Houston.  I was already aware that President Bush and I shared a birthday so I looked forward to this opportunity to potentially meet him</p>
<p>After being introduced to the President, I said, “It is an honor to meet you, sir.  You and I share a birthday.”</p>
<p>President Bush turned to me without missing a beat and said, “You’re 80?!?”</p>
<p>I was 29 at the time.</p>
<p>The story sticks with me to this day because of the unique opportunity, but for such a leader to demonstrate such a quick sense of humor and lightheartedness.</p>

Overall things went well in both states with turnout in<a href="https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/nebraska-and-lancaster-county-record-32-voter-turnout-in-tuesdays-primary/article_10d86dc1-6326-538f-8106-b5a17ac86183.html"> Nebraska</a> being higher than expected. Once concern leading into<a href="https://www.3newsnow.com/news/political/nebraska-voters-hit-the-polls-for-2022-primary-election"> Tuesday’s primaries</a> in Nebraska was that recent redistricting may pose problems, but those problems didn’t seem to arise. “One of the things that has really surprised me about primary election day in Hall County, is the lack of calls at the office from people wanting to know where to go. We put an extra phone line in cause we have 40% of our voters who are at a different polling site this election, and I think people have done a really good job of planning ahead,”<a href="https://www.ksnblocal4.com/2022/05/12/minimal-trouble-during-primary-election-despite-hall-county-polling-changes/"> Hall County</a> Elections Commissioner Tracy Overstreet told a local television station. Redistricting also didn’t seem to affect voting in<a href="https://www.ksnblocal4.com/2022/05/11/early-voting-turnout-smooth-adams-county/"> Adams County</a>. “We did put notices on all of the old polling locations to direct them to how to look up their polling site, so maybe that has helped,” said Adams County Court Clerk Ramona Thomas. “We did also do a mailing prior to the election letting everyone know about the changes.”<a href="https://chadronradio.com/news/no-problems-and-46-6-voter-turnout-in-dawes-county/"> Dawes County</a> saw a 46.6% turnout rate with almost no problems. Poll workers in<a href="https://www.klkntv.com/lancaster-county-polls-running-pretty-well-on-primary-day/"> Lancaster County</a> were prepared for the turnout and there were few issues. Incumbent Secretary of State<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/10/us/elections/results-nebraska-secretary-of-state.html"> Bob Evnen</a> won the Republican primary. In West Virginia, even though state and local elections officials worked to get out the word about redistricting, some problems did arise on Tuesday. In<a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2022/05/10/redistricting-adds-obstacles-for-county-clerks-on-election-day/"> Berkeley County</a>, which had to increase from 66 to 80 precincts County Clerk Elaine Mauck said there was some confusion. “We have some confusion,” she said. “The delegate districts have changed (because of redistricting) and we’ve from 66 precincts to 80—our population has just exploded.” Voters on Charleston’s West Side, voiced concerns about a polling being relocated dues to construction in<a href="https://www.wvpublic.org/wvpb-news/2022-05-10/polling-frustrations-for-charlestons-west-side-voters"> Kanawha County</a>. “We are three generations of West Virginia women voting, and nothing will prevent us from voting,” voter Judy Hamilton said once she, her mother and her daughter cast their ballots. Election results came in faster than ever before thanks to new voting machines in<a href="https://www.wvnstv.com/news/west-virginia-news/raleigh-county/voting-machines-speed-raleigh-county-election-results-this-year/"> Raleigh County</a>. County Clerk Danny Moore says the new machines are synced with the Secretary of State’s results website. The new voting machines were purchased by the county for a sum of 1.5 million dollars.<a href="https://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/local-news/2022/05/rhodes-primary-election-a-success-in-wood-county/"> Wood County</a>, County Clerk Mark Rhodes said other than a couple of technical issues and a few poll workers who called in sick, but it was not as bad as Rhodes thought it could get.<a href="https://www.theintelligencer.net/news/community/2022/05/marshall-clerk-satisfied-with-new-voting-machines/"> Marshall County</a> Clerk Melanie Madden was pleased with the roll out of the county’s new voting technology.</p>

But this week there’s news that two elections offices are getting brand new, from the ground up, facilities. In<a href="https://www.wesh.com/article/supervisor-of-elections-building-construction-seminole-county/39959166"> Seminole County, Florida</a> Elections Supervisor Chris Anderson is pushing the county commission to move faster on a new facility that will not only be more secure but will help him accommodate the additional staff he needs to handle the increase in voters. A new building will alleviate some of the day-to-day challenges and allow Anderson to focus on the big picture and future election issues. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we need to be self-contained and be self-sufficient to address our own needs,&#8221; Anderson said.  The start of construction and how large the building are still to be determined. And in Ohio, the<a href="https://www.timesreporter.com/story/news/2022/05/11/county-build-new-board-elections-office-new-philadelphia/9704303002/"> Tuscarawas County</a> commission voted this week to purchase land to build a new building for the county board of elections. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a very exciting project for the county,&#8221; said Commissioner Al Landis. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to be something of high value and something that will last a long time.&#8221; The county elections office is currently housed in the basement of the courthouse which has limited space, especially for early voting. &#8220;We are very, very grateful for the patience of the voters in our county,&#8221; elections Director Gail Garbrandt said. &#8220;They deserve better. The commissioners recognize this. We applaud them in their efforts and the board and our staff are all looking forward to working together to make this happen as seamlessly as possible.&#8221;</p>

The<a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/politics/election-integrity-bill-moves-forward-after-long-night-of-debate"> Internal Election Security Measures</a> bill is aimed at preventing insider attacks on the state’s voting system. Among other things, the bill will: require clerks and recorder office employees, election officials and others to take a certification course on things like election law, risk-limiting audits and election security within a set amount of time. Prohibit someone from serving as an election official if they have been convicted of any election offense or other crimes like sedition or treason. Put more parameters around who can have access to voting machines and how the machines must be stored. Require 24/7, year-round surveillance of voting machines and stipulates that the footage must be stored for 25 months. Ban the imaging of hard drives without the state’s written permission. Offer money for the state and counties to assess potential election risks. Stipulate that anyone who tampers with or facilitates unauthorized access to electronic voting machines is guilty of a class 5 felony. Require the use of electronic voting equipment in most circumstances and limits the use of hand counts. Set out rules for what would happen if a county won’t certify an abstract of its votes by the deadline. During<a href="https://www.cpr.org/2022/05/10/colorado-election-security-bill-tina-peters/"> House mark-up and vote</a> legislators greed to remove a provision that would have banned anyone overseeing elections from knowingly or recklessly making false statements about the process, an effort that raised First Amendment concerns.

Laura Kelly (D) signed House Bill 2138, a<a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/05/10/kansas-effort-to-improve-computer-science-education-signed-into-law/"> package of election law modifications</a> including the requirement that all voting systems use paper ballots with a distinctive watermark. Advocacy groups and legislators opposing this bill argue the watermark is a considerable unfunded mandate. The measure also creates a new reason for county election officers to send a confirmation of address notice when there is no election-related activity from a registered voter for four years. If the notice is returned as “undeliverable” or there is no response, the person would be removed from the voter roll according to Clay Barker, deputy assistant secretary of state. “We don’t want to remove people just because they haven’t voted, but not voting combined with the card is an indication that they have likely moved,” Barker said during a February hearing on the bill.</p>

Debbie Villio, R-Kenner, was approved in the House and Governmental Affairs Committee in a 7-5 vote with Rep. Malinda White, an independent from Bogalusa, siding with Republicans in favor of the proposal. The proposal would change a provision in the Louisiana Constitution that currently gives every “citizen of the state,” who is at least 18, the right to register and vote. The amendment would add the phrase “and the United States” after the word “state” and an additional subsection to prohibit local governments from changing any voter registration qualifications.  Villio said the amendment is needed to prevent towns and cities in Louisiana from doing what New York City did last year. A law was passed there that gave all residents, regardless of citizenship, the ability to vote in municipal elections.</p>

After a nine-hour Democratic filibuster last week, Democrats agreed to let the bill come to a vote after adding an amendment to allow for in-person, no-excuse absentee voting during the two weeks before an election at the local election authority office. A move to allow for satellite in-person absentee voting was squashed. The bill also includes several recommendations —  such as prohibiting touchscreen voting machines and requiring a number of cybersecurity checks. Under the bill, sponsored by state Rep. John Simmons, R-Washington, registered voters would either have to get a government-issued photo ID or else only be allowed to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day.  The provisional ballot would be counted only if the voter returns later that day with a photo ID or if election officials can verify their signature based on voter records. Funds could also be withheld if the secretary of state finds a local election authority has not properly maintained their voter registration lists or accepts private donations.</p>

The group has met twice to date, most recently in late April, and has grown to include Republican and Democratic legislators from both chambers, as well as a representative from Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen’s office and Commissioner of Political Practices Jeff Mangan, whose office shares oversight of certain election and voter fraud matters with Jacobsen. “We want to talk about just what goes on in Montana and how do we increase voter confidence, because a lot of people don’t know how the voting system works, and a lot of legislators don’t,” Rep. Steve Gist (R-Great Falls) said. “Even I came away with more knowledge after our first in-person meeting [in April] of how things work.”</p>

The state Assembly and statewide races were unaffected by the ruling, and remain scheduled for June 28. State Sen. James Tedisco and Assemblyman John Salka are proposing legislation  that would<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/ny-state-of-politics/2022/05/09/lawmakers-want-funding-for-two-primaries-in-new-york"> help cover the costs for an additional primary</a> in New York. Elections officials like Saratoga County&#8217;s Roger Schiera worry the logistics of holding two primary votes on short notice will be a logistical challenge to find workers.  &#8220;We face problems with fatigue for election workers because there&#8217;s going to be the extra election and turning out the extra people we need to do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s over 700, more like 800 support people for a full election.&#8221; Statewide, a full primary can cost up to $30 million to administer.</p>

The governor will likely sign the bill and lawmakers say early voting could be in place by the end of May. State election officials didn’t immediately respond to a question if that is possible.</p>

To date, the DOJ has provided no documents in response to the FGA’s FOIA requests, it said, prompting the FGA to sue.</p>

Jess Askew III, one of the plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys, filed an emergency motion for expedited consideration and petition for the writ. The attempt to get the transcript of the four-day bench trial that was held in March came in hopes of moving the appeal forward and getting a final ruling before the November general elections. Dylan Jacobs, deputy solicitor general in the Arkansas attorney general&#8217;s office, filed a brief opposing the plaintiffs&#8217; petition, which Askew answered in a tendered reply just after noon Friday. The unsigned, two-sentence order denying the plaintiffs&#8217; petition without explanation was filed 20 minutes later by the Supreme Court. The lawsuit &#8212; filed in December on behalf of the League of Women Voters, Arkansas United and five individual registered voters &#8212; targeted four laws passed in the last legislative session that the plaintiffs said would disenfranchise voters who are poor, members of minority groups, immigrants or are dealing with chronic health problems. Defendants in the lawsuit are Secretary of State John Thurston and the Arkansas Board of Election Commissioners. The brief, one-page order issued April 1 by the Supreme Court was unsigned and gave no reason for issuing the stay. The order denying the writ petition was also brief.</p>

Bequette filed suit against Thurston and both the Craighead County Election Commission and the state Election Commission. The suit asks Judge Mackie Pierce to: Order the Secretary of State, the State Board of Election Commissioners, the Craighead County Election Commission and its Commissioners, and all county election commissions in the state to immediately correct their respective Republican primary official ballots to properly identify him as Jake Bequette. Order the Secretary of State, the State Board of Election Commissioners, the Craighead County Election Commission and its Commissioners, and all county election commissions in the state to provide uniform statewide notice to all Republican voters in the state of the misidentification.</p>

Robison supported the secretary of state&#8217;s petition, saying Peters and Knisley &#8220;have committed neglect of duty and are unable to perform the duties of the Mesa County Designated Election Official.&#8221; Brandi Bantz, the county&#8217;s election director, will now oversee the upcoming elections.

Brimmer rejected the plaintiffs&#8217; request for a temporary restraining order, finding no allegations that USEIP was currently intimidating voters in a way that required emergency action. However, Brimmer subsequently refused to dismiss the lawsuit outright, saying the plaintiffs had credibly claimed that USEIP&#8217;s actions had harmed them directly. &#8220;Any of the plaintiff organizations in these cases theoretically could have chosen not to devote resources to countering the defendants’ conduct and, in that sense, their drained resources were volitional. But courts have considered organizations in similar positions to have been &#8216;forced&#8217; to act,&#8221; Brimmer wrote</p>

The panel in part cited U.S. Supreme Court precedent discouraging judicial intervention in elections too close to election day, lest doing so confuse voters. That 2006 ruling in Purcell v. Gonzalez didn’t define what “too close” means, but the 11th Circuit panel concluded that because preparations for the elections were already underway the state is entitled to enforce its law (<a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/90">SB 90</a>). The unsigned opinion faults Chief Judge Mark Walker of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida in Tallahassee for failure to extend a presumption of good faith.  “The Supreme Court has instructed that when a court assesses whether duly enacted statute is tainted by discriminatory intent, the good faith of the state legislature must be presumed,” the panel wrote. “For starters, in its 288-page opinion, the district court never once mentioned the presumption. And while we do not require courts to incant magic words, it does not appear to us that the district court here meaningfully accounted for the presumption at all.”</p>

The plaintiffs in the case, led by Fair Fight Action, told the judge that testimony from 52 witnesses over the past month showed that “exact match” registration rules and absentee ballot cancellation practices violate voting laws. “Without the federal protection of the court, more and more voters will be burdened,” said Allegra Lawrence-Hardy, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. “These voter witnesses are the tip of the iceberg.” Exact match registration rules, which require ID verification for minor inconsistencies in a name’s spelling, should be eliminated, Lawrence-Hardy said. All voters must show ID anyway, and she said “exact match” creates an unnecessary burden that has a disproportionate racial impact because 70% of flagged voters are Black. She said citizenship verification should be improved after an audit by the secretary of state’s office found that 63% of voters flagged as potential noncitizens were actually U.S. citizens. The plaintiffs said registrations should be checked against the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements program. In addition, the plaintiffs are seeking improved training to ensure absentee voters who decide to instead vote in person can cast ballots, and they requested more rigorous methods when identifying potential felons who are ineligible to vote in Georgia.</p>

Mohamed was charged in connection with a wider federal investigation into misuse of the absentee ballot “agent delivery” process, which is when voters with health problems or disabilities can have someone deliver their ballot to an election office. Mohamed was convicted of two counts of lying to the grand jury, which prosecutors said made it difficult for their investigation to proceed. The grand jury has spent more than a year investigating whether absentee ballots were being turned in without voters’ knowledge in the August 2020 primary election. According to the Minnesota Reformer, it’s not clear whether the grand jury’s work is done, and federal prosecutors declined to comment.</p>

A group of voters backed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee attempted to stop the state from pushing the date back by two months, arguing that a late August primary would reduce the turnaround time before the general election and risk disenfranchising New Yorkers casting ballots from abroad. Sharpe approved the Aug. 23 primary date Tuesday, saying he was “not persuaded” by the Democratic voters’ “speculative assertions that they will be disenfranchised by the delayed primary.” “The later primary will accommodate the preparation of new Congressional maps and still provide ample time for compliance,” Sharpe wrote in his order.</p>

Supreme Court said that it would take over a lawsuit<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/news/2022/05/07/n-c--supreme-court-taking-over-appeal-on-voting-by-offenders"> seeking to change when felony offenders can vote again</a>, rather than wait for intermediate-level appeals judges to decide whether it was right for a trial court to loosen restrictions. The justices agreed to a motion filed by the suing ex-offenders and civil rights groups last month asking the state&#8217;s highest court to review the case before the Court of Appeals ruled on the crux of the lawsuit&#8217;s issue. That likely means a sooner final outcome — potentially before the November midterms — over the future of a 1973 law that prevents someone convicted of a felony from having voting rights restored while they are still on probation, parole or post-release supervision. The plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers told the justices it was appropriate because the case involved significant legal matters that could affect 56,000 people currently without voting rights.</p>

By a bipartisan 4-3 majority, the Ohio Supreme Court has so far tossed out four sets of legislative maps that were drawn by the Republican-dominated Ohio Redistricting Commission. The judges found those maps to be unfairly gerrymandered. The dispute over redrawing the maps resulted in races for state representative and senator being left off Ohio’s May 3 primary ballot. This week, Republicans asked the court to accept the third set of maps for just this year, and not order any more map-drawing until after the Nov. 8 elections. Ohio has limped nearly halfway into the year without a firm date for its Statehouse primaries. The process was supposed to be done in September, 2021.</p>

Pennsylvania&#8217;s Sunshine Act states that a government agency needs to provide the public with at least 24 hours’ notice of any official action by posting its agenda on its website.  &#8220;There&#8217;s three violations of the Sunshine Act,&#8221; Marian Schneider, the senior voting rights policy council for ACLU-Pa., said. “One, it wasn’t listed on the agenda. Two, they failed to give the citizens notice that they were going to discuss it. And three, they didn’t have any formal deliberation, didn’t take a vote, and didn’t record the vote in the minutes.” The case was filed in the Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas and asks the court to issue an order prohibiting the commissioners from removing the drop box unless a &#8220;properly announced meeting&#8221; is held to consider the issue publicly.  This lawsuit has been filed on behalf of two county residents, according to the press release: Brian Frey, a lifelong county resident of Ephrata, and Jon Foley Sherman of Manheim Township.</p>

Lawyers for Harris County Elections Administrator Isabel Longoria argued that a part of Texas&#8217; newly enacted voting laws banning election administrators from sending out mass mail-in ballot applications violates the First Amendment. Longoria sued Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton late last year, challenging the enforcement of a law she said violates her free speech and prevents her office from doing its job. That case reached a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel, which asked the Texas justices to certify three questions before it makes its ruling. Among other things, lawyers questioned whether Texas&#8217; election code under Senate Bill 1 defines volunteer deputy registrars. The 5th Circuit also asked the court to consider what constitutes &#8220;solicitation&#8221; within the state&#8217;s election code. In her appeal, Longoria&#8217;s legal team questions whether the definition is narrowly limited to seeking applications for mail-in ballots that would be illegally cast, or if it includes what Longoria said is part of her job: &#8220;telling those who are elderly or disabled, for example, that they have the opportunity to apply for mail-in ballots.&#8221; Lastly, the court will evaluate what sort of jurisdiction the attorney general has over the election code.</p>
