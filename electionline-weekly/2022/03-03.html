							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Elected vs. Appointed</strong><br />
<em>New work by UCLA researchers on local election officials</em></p>
<p>By<a href="https://blogs.reed.edu/paul-gronke/"> Paul Gronke, </a>Professor of Political Science, Reed College<br />
Director, Elections &amp; Voting Information Center</p>
<p>There is lots of interesting and important work being done in the growing field of election science by several academic researchers throughout the United States and around the world. Thanks to Mindy Morretti and electionline for generously allowing me and the<a href="https://evic.reed.edu/"> Elections &amp; Voting Information Center (EVIC)</a> team at<a href="https://www.reed.edu/"> Reed College</a> to share a bit about a few of them in this first article of a three-part series.</p>
<p>We start by profiling research by scholars that takes a fresh look at an age-old question, one that has become increasingly important as<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/19/us/politics/republican-states.html"> partisan conflict over election laws and procedures</a> continues to grow.</p>
<p>Does it matter that local election administrators in many states obtain their positions via competitive partisan elections?</p>
<p>Many elections officials operate on the assumption that professional norms outweigh partisanship, and that the label on a ballot is nothing more than that: a label.</p>
<p>Many political scientists, in contrast, assume partisanship is everything and is inescapable. Among the voting public, political scientists have shown that partisanship is now the most important predictor of political preferences, far<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/10/05/takeaways-on-americans-growing-partisan-divide-over-political-values/"> outweighing age, race, religion, and gender.</a> Partisan differences have gotten so severe that some view members of the opposite camp as<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/29/opinion/political-polarization-partisanship.html"> active threats to our democracy</a>.</p>
<p>Where does this leave elections officials who run for office under a partisan label?<a href="https://democracyfund.org/idea/perspectives-on-election-policy-and-practice-from-local-officials/"> Surveys of local election officials</a> (LEOs) have shown a strong commitment to voter education and voter-centric election administration regardless of party. But preferences may not be enough. What do officials do in action?</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) have been examining how partisanship impacts election administration. The answers so far are encouraging. In two papers presented at the January 2022<a href="http://www.spsa.net"> Southern Political Science Association</a> (SPSA) meeting, these scholars found almost no discernible partisan differences in how LEOs administered elections. A summary of our conversation with our colleagues at UCLA follows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.joshuaferrer.com/">Joshua Ferrer</a>,<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/igorgeyn/home"> Igor Geyn</a>, and<a href="https://dthompson.scholar.ss.ucla.edu/"> Dan Thompson</a> are three researchers at UCLA developing innovative ways to explore elections and election administration in the United States. Joshua and Igor are graduate students working with Dan, a political science professor at UCLA who earned his PhD at Stanford University. Dan’s efforts at UCLA complement those of<a href="https://stanforddpl.org/"> Stanford’s Democracy and Polarization Lab</a>, where Dan was a graduate student. Keep your eyes out for research in local election administration coming out of both of these shops.</p>
<p>We started our conversation by asking all three about how they first became interested in elections and local election administration. Dan told us that his interest was “motivated by what’s going on in the world,” and that he found the field’s relevance to both policy and political theory fascinating, but too often ignored.</p>
<p>Joshua and Igor echoed these sentiments, underlining the need for research that continues through the off-cycle years, when scholarly interest often wanes. As graduate students, they both describe election administration and election science as nascent fields with plenty of room for growth. They are particularly interested in partnerships with election administrators and exploring new uses for administrative data.</p>
<p>Their paper,<a href="https://www.joshuaferrer.com/publication/how-partisan-is-local-election-administration/how-partisan-is-local-election-administration.pdf"> “How Partisan is Local Election Administration?”</a> exemplifies this approach. The central issue they faced was causality–an issue that is at the core of much of modern social science research, and one that is particularly difficult in the elections space, where so many things change at once.</p>
<p>The central question of their paper is this: is it possible to show that the partisanship of a local official causes a different set of political outcomes?</p>
<p>If this were a medical experiment, we would randomly assign Republican, Democratic, and Unaffiliated officials to different jurisdictions. Random assignment solves the causality problem – it means that we can attribute any differences in outcomes to the “treatment.”</p>
<p>But the real world isn’t a medical experiment, and the researchers had to be more creative. Their solution was to start with all jurisdictions which entrust partisan elected officials with primary responsibility over local election administration (shown in the map below) and then focus on those jurisdictions that are very competitive. The team is able to show that these competitive jurisdictions are quite similar on most other important political and demographic measures. Put another way, the only difference between a Republican LEO in a slightly Democratic district and a Democratic LEO in a slightly Republican district is the partisanship of the victor. Therefore, we can treat these cases “as if” they were randomly assigned, just like the medical experiment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-8107" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA1.png" alt="" width="901" height="601" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA1.png 1136w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA1-300x200.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA1-1024x683.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA1-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></p>
<p>For the statistics nerds, they estimate a model called “regression discontinuity” that compares jurisdictions on either side of the 50% line. You can see how this works visually in the graphic below. It doesn’t look like there’s a substantial jump (“discontinuity”) at the 50% mark. Their statistical model confirms what our eyes see: there is no statistically significant change.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-8108" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA2.png" alt="" width="818" height="568" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA2.png 1046w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA2-300x208.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA2-1024x711.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA2-768x533.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 818px) 100vw, 818px" /></p>
<p>The result is worth repeating: the researchers did not find evidence that LEOs elected as partisans favored their party, intentionally or unintentionally. Their conclusions held not just for the partisan vote totals, but also for a wide variety of other election administration measures drawn from the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>’s<a href="https://www.eac.gov/research-and-data/studies-and-reports"> Election Administration and Voting  Survey (EAVS)</a>. Kudos to the UCLA team, by the way, for looking beyond just vote totals to the full array of administrative actions and procedures, such as the number of polling places, absentee ballot rejection rates, provisional ballot rates, provisional rejection rates, registration removal rates, partisan composition of the registration rolls, and wait times.</p>
<p>These results run counter to the prevailing wisdom about partisanship and LEOs, which asserts that LEOs elected as partisans make choices, even unconsciously, that benefit their party. The UCLA paper supports the idea that LEOs primarily function as administrators–not political actors–and that they are<a href="https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/the-evolution-of-professionalism-in-the-field-of-election-admini/16853460"> guided by professionalism over partisanship.</a></p>
<p>A second look at the impact of the elective path on election administration is provided by Joshua Ferrer in his paper: “<a href="https://www.joshuaferrer.com/publication/electing_leos/electing_leos.pdf">Does Appointing Election Officials Produce Better </a><a href="https://www.joshuaferrer.com/publication/electing_leos/electing_leos.pdf">Election Administration? Evidence from Georgia and Texas</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>While collecting historical data on LEO elections, Joshua recognized that, since the late 1960s through the present, many counties in Georgia and Texas have shifted from electing to appointing LEOs. History provides a different way to isolate the causal impact of elections vs. appointments, because we are comparing the same states and the same jurisdictions over time.</p>
<p>Joshua’s paper shows that jurisdictions with appointed LEOs have higher turnout when compared to jurisdictions with elected LEOs (shown in the graphic below). But why is this the case? The change may be due to capacity and experience–potentially professionalism in action once again.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-8109" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA3.png" alt="" width="934" height="601" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA3.png 1196w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA3-300x193.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA3-1024x659.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/UCLA3-768x494.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px" /></p>
<p>With elections becoming increasingly technical and time-demanding affairs, dedicated appointed LEOs may be better equipped, resourced, and monitored to successfully tackle the administrative challenge. Joshua is following up these results with additional research to nail down the reasons for the difference.</p>
<p>This research is also very relevant today, with many states and jurisdictions debating about whether to switch to non-partisan elected or appointed administrators.</p>
<p>If you are interested in election science work being conducted by our colleagues at UCLA, please reach out to Dan Thompson at dthompson at polisci dot ucla dot edu or find him on<a href="https://twitter.com/danmthomp"> Twitter</a>. Dan, Joshua and Igor would especially love to hear from more LEOs to discuss what they are experiencing &#8211; and continue learning from them.</p>
<p>In our next article, we’ll highlight some additional election science researchers and share a bit about their specific focuses and ongoing work. Thanks for reading!</p>

There was plenty of news leading up to the primary with the impacts of SB1 on<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/03/02/texas-primary-ballot-rejections/"> mail-in ballots</a> and according to the Texas Tribune, there are still thousands of mail ballots that may not be counted because they lack the proper identification as required by the new laws. “People have said this law was enacted to stop voter fraud, but honestly we&#8217;ve just seen voters who are qualified have to do the process twice, sometimes three times. Sometimes they quit,” said Lisa Wise, the elections administrator for El Paso County, where more than 1,000 ballots have been initially rejected. Several voting locations throughout the state were<a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/politics/elections/texas-voting-locations-staff-shortages/285-c143a174-23aa-4e87-a854-27c45393c6ce"> unable to open because of election staff shortages</a>, causing some to open later in the day and others to shut down completely. Locations in Dallas, Tarrant and Hidalgo counties reported missing either a Republican or Democratic Party election judge. These staff members are appointed by their respective parties to oversee polling sites. If one of the parties’ judges is absent, the polling site cannot operate. That’s because by state law, no polling site can serve only one party. In<a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/politics/elections/texas-primary-election-day-updates/285-af4192ef-b2c0-4b3e-be9e-8dcbef5eff06"> Harris County</a>, a variety of issues were reported by voters on Election Day, including people who were turned away due to technical issues. Other issues in Harris County included a<a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/politics/elections/harris-county-attorney-investigators-voting-issues/285-22fb66b6-780d-4a10-93dd-390e8ce44381"> fist fight</a> at one polling place. Problems at the polls in Harris—the state’s largest voting jurisdiction—lead to a delayed tally with officials posting final unofficial results at 12:37am on Thursday. &#8220;The entire state is going to be moving to a paper-based system within the next few years because it is required by law now. So what we’re seeing is us doing our checks and balances, crossing our T&#8217;s and dotting out I&#8217;s to make sure every vote is properly brought in, presented to central count and counted appropriately,&#8221; said Beth Stevens with the Harris County Elections. Of course issues weren’t limited to Harris County though. In<a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/local/2022/03/02/travis-county-clerk-election-results-2022-website-crash-primary-night/9345802002/"> Travis County</a>, the county’s elections website was down for about 40 minutes after polls closed and early vote totals should have been rolling in.  In several polling places in<a href="https://www.fox7austin.com/news/internet-connectivity-issues-cause-delay-at-some-wilco-polling-locations-no-voters-turned-away"> Williamson County</a> there were connectivity issues that forced poll workers to manually choose ballots for voters instead of relying on a barcode. Two<a href="https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2022/03/01/2-denton-county-polling-sites-open-extra-hours-equipment/"> Denton County</a> polling sites stayed open an extra two hours due to equipment delays earlier in the day. Officials are questioning the election equipment in<a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/politics/lone-star-politics/fort-worth-election-results-delayed-tarrant-county-judge-glen-whitley-announces/2904108/"> Tarrant County</a> after results were delayed until Wednesday morning. And the cars didn’t crash into the polling place in<a href="https://kdhnews.com/news/local/killeen-election-day-marked-by-sunshine-lines-and-fire/article_897b1900-9973-11ec-8dd6-5fa05cb069df.html"> Bell County</a>, but a collision outside a voting location temporarily blocked voters from being able to access the site.</p>

It was a late night for<a href="https://www.timesargus.com/news/local/absentee-ballots-prompt-problems-with-voting-machines-in-washington-central-and-barre/article_e09eb9ba-818b-5ec0-b983-e53bc2132bd2.html"> East Montpelier</a> Clerk Rosie Laquerre after issues with a finicky tabulator delayed ballot counting that didn’t end till around 1:30am Wednesday. Tabulation issues also arose in<a href="https://www.timesargus.com/news/local/absentee-ballots-prompt-problems-with-voting-machines-in-washington-central-and-barre/article_e09eb9ba-818b-5ec0-b983-e53bc2132bd2.html"> Barre</a>. In<a href="https://www.rutlandherald.com/news/local/city-runs-out-of-ballots/article_c86ec3e6-c495-514a-85ac-d49b17040de1.html"> Rutland</a>, City Clerk Henry Heck said he ran out of ballots and had to make photocopies for more than 200 voters. Those ballots then need to be hand-counted. A nearby bank robbery forced one<a href="https://www.wcax.com/2022/03/01/burlington-bank-robbery-temporarily-closes-polling-location/"> Burlington</a> polling place to go into a brief lockdown. A confrontation near a polling place in<a href="https://www.benningtonbanner.com/local-news/election-day-squabble-ends-in-police-investigation/article_dda35632-9a6d-11ec-bd50-3fa9510bb509.html"> Bennington</a> is being investigated by police for possible criminal charges. And probably the largest news out of Town Meeting Day is that<a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/vermont-noncitizen-voting-town-meeting-day-winooski-montpelier/39288125"> noncitizens</a> in two Vermont cities were able to legally cast their ballots in local elections for the first time.  &#8220;I felt a little bit emotional as I walked into the ballot box,&#8221; said Jenny Norris, a British citizen who has lived in Winooski for more than a decade and who voted for the first time in the U.S. this week. Nganwa Wilondja, originally from Congo, said Tuesday that getting to vote in Winooski made him<a href="https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/local/2022/03/01/winooski-noncitizen-voting-vt-noncitizen-voters-vote-first-time/6981612001/"> feel more like a member of the community</a>, where five of his children currently attend school. &#8220;We’re proud of that,&#8221; said Winooski City Clerk Jenny Willingham, who told NECN she registered dozens of first-time voters under this new policy. The city supplied translations of ballot materials in languages including Swahili, Nepali, and Burmese, Willingham said.</p>

Gableman recommended legislators make the state&#8217;s voter list available for free, make it easier to sue over the voter rolls, and limit mail voting and early in-person voting. Wisconsin allows no-excuse absentee voting and offers in-person early voting for two weeks before election day.  Meagan Wolfe, director of the commission, in a statement said Gableman had not turned up anything new after months of review.  &#8220;The opinions in the Special Counsel’s latest interim report were fixated on topics that have been thoroughly addressed,&#8221; she said in her statement. &#8220;The integrity of the November 2020 election, and of the WEC, has been shown time and time again through court cases and previous investigations.&#8221;</p>

In a news release, the secretary of state’s office said New Mexico Audit Force is going door-to-door in Otero County asking voters about their personal information and their participation in the 2020 election. “These are exactly the kinds of things that makes folks want to no longer participate in democracy,” said Toulouse Oliver. “They don’t think their ballot is private, which it 100% is, and if they think that these other things about marital status, and whether or not they’re voting, or how they’re voting, are not private, it can cause those concerns.” Some groups are allowed to request publicly available data like party affiliation or if you voted in a certain election. But the secretary of state says the New Mexico Audit Force has not requested any of it. There are also concerns the information could be used to harass voters. “You can not take personal information and use it to harass voters, you can’t use it to somehow get information that is private from voters,” said Attorney General Hector Balderas. “That is unacceptable and quite frankly illegal.”</p>

Woodward-Granger was the first school in the state to qualify for the award this year. “I’m very impressed with the students, faculty and leadership at Woodward-Granger High School to be the first school in the state to win the Catt Award this year, and for registering 100 percent of eligible students to vote,” Pate said. “This shows there is an exceptional group of young people at Woodward-Granger, and they have a dedication to civics and a commitment to their community.” This is Woodward-Granger’s second time winning the award.

She was 95. Stegall started working for the elections office in 1958. She won her first election in 1972. “I’m still here,” she joked after closing out the final vote tally in 2016. That was the year she announced her retirement. Stegall&#8217;s 44-year tenure as the elected supervisor was recognized in 2020, when the new elections building was named for her. Stegall was the lone elected Democrat in heavily Republican area and current Lake County Supervisor of Elections Alan Hays attributed that to her passion for the job and nonpartisanship. “I’ve had Republicans tell me that she was the only Democrat they voted for,” said Alan Hays, a Republican, and the current supervisor.  “For her to hold office for 44 years is a phenomenal accomplishment.&#8221; Stegall was a longtime officer in the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections. She was also a member of the Professional Women of Eustis, Pilot Club, League of Women Voters, and the Tavares Women’s Club. She and her family have been active members of the Tavares Methodist Church for more than 70 years. “The first time I met Emogene, I was amazed at her ability to manage all the things she had to do,&#8221; said County Commissioner Leslie Campione. &#8220;She was such a kind and professional woman.”</p>

Kelly Townsend (R-Apache Junction),<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/02/24/gop-smart-ballot-drop-boxes-come-with-a-hefty-price-tag-if-theyre-ever-created/"> ballot drop boxes</a> would have to take pictures or video of depositors and generate receipts for up to seven early ballots per person. And they would have to be able to link every ballot inserted with the person who made the deposit. Townsend’s bill has been approved by two Senate committees, most recently the Senate Appropriations Committee on Feb. 22. en Marson, executive director for the Arizona Association of Counties, estimates that there are 160 outside drop boxes statewide, and replacing them all with high-tech versions would have a hefty price tag. A Phoenix company that provides some election equipment and ballots for Arizona elections estimated the “smart” boxes that Townsend is proposing would cost $15,000 each. “Their initial cost estimate is $15,000 per, so that puts you just under $2.4 million,” she said.</p>
<p>The House gave preliminary approval to put a measure on the November ballot to require the 80% of Arizonans who use early ballots to provide<a href="https://tucson.com/news/voting-early-in-arizona-could-mandate-extra-id-requirements/article_20d00016-965b-11ec-b434-173eeb7caeb1.html"> additional identification</a> if they want their votes counted. Now, voters need only provide a signature on the envelope which county election officials match with documents already on file. And the proposed constitutional amendment, approved with only Republican votes, also would narrow the types of identification that the state considers acceptable. Hours later the Senate, also along party lines, gave final approval to an identical proposal. That paves the way for a final House vote this coming week paving the way to be referred to voters. The views of Gov. Doug Ducey are irrelevant as the Arizona Constitution gives him no role on what goes on the ballot.</p>
<p>The House has approved a bill that would require<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/arizona-gop-pushes-bills-to-require-voters-prove-citizenship/"> proof of citizenship</a> in order to register to vote.<a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2R/bills/HB2492H.pdf"> House Bill 2492</a> would require all potential voters in Arizona to present an ID at registration or within 30 days of registering to vote. Previous bill versions had shorter periods of time for individuals to provide proof of citizenship, drawing criticism from some Arizona Democrats. The amended bill aimed to address some of those concerns. With HB 2492, undocumented individuals who vote in the election could face severe penalties. The bill requires the state attorney general to &#8220;prosecute individuals who are found to not be United States citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>The House also passed<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/arizona-gop-pushes-bills-to-require-voters-prove-citizenship/"> amendments</a> to<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/77849"> House Bills 2780</a> and<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/77772"> 2710</a>. Amendments to HB 2780 would prevent election officials from being on hand-count teams and establish an electronic voter registration profile that could not be used commercially. The amendments to HB 2710 would require ballots to be tagged with computerized digital numbers to ensure they are accurately numbered instead of manually numbered. Additionally, it would ensure ballots aren&#8217;t separated by precinct if they are part of early provisional voting. However, all votes will be digitally sorted by precinct.</p>

The bill, also called the Vote Without Fear Act, exempts law enforcement or any hired private security, and it doesn’t apply to voters who have concealed-carry licenses. Sponsors of the bill said the law is needed because of the current charged political climate over elections and the need to ensure Coloradans that they are safe and secure while voting, adding that the measure doesn’t create gun-free zones or infringe on any constitutional right. Rep. Tom Sullivan, D-Centennial, one of the bill’s sponsors, said the issue is no different for First Amendment rights that limited political speech around polling areas, where voters are not allowed to express their views within 100 feet of a voting place to show their support for or against individual candidates or ballot measures.</p>

The bill (<a href="https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=76653&amp;SessionId=93">HB 7061</a>), which<a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/493336-elections-overhaul-passes-first-house-committee-stop-amid-democrat-opposition/"> emerged</a> from the House Public Integrity and Elections Committee in February, contains several of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ “election integrity” priorities. Despite bipartisan agreement the 2020 election was possibly the smoothest in Florida’s recent history, the bill is Republicans’ second follow-up measure to strengthen Florida’s voting laws. The Appropriations Committee is expected to take up an amendment, filed by bill sponsor and Miami Republican Rep. Daniel Perez. The amendment largely conforms the bill to the Senate version (<a href="https://flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022/524">SB 524</a>), which could soon appear on the Senate floor. Among other changes, the amendment would ask supervisors of elections to annually maintain voter roll lists instead of every two years, one of DeSantis’ requests. It would also remove a section requiring the last four digits of a voter’s social security number, driver’s license or photo ID on vote-by-mail ballots.</p>

If passed and signed into law, HB 1096 would override the ballot drop box requirements implemented by Senate Bill 202. With this legislation, Rep. Moore seeks to mirror the state’s election protocols that were introduced during the governor’s COVID-19 public health emergency in 2020. HB 1096 would require each county to establish one or more drop box locations within the county as a means for absentee-by-mail electors to deliver their ballots. These drop boxes would only be allowed on government property. Ballot drop boxes would also be required to have adequate lighting, video surveillance and be made of durable material to withstand vandalism and inclement weather. The ballot drop boxes must also be immovable and clearly labeled. Additionally, ballot drop boxes would be required to be available 49 days prior to any primary or general election with the exception of municipal elections. They would close at 7 p.m. on the day of the election. For a state-wide or federal special election or runoff election, drop box locations would be allowed to be opened on the first day of advanced voting.</p>

Priscilla Giddings, R-White Bird, is sponsoring a new bill, which she said is designed to protect election integrity by<a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2022/02/25/new-bill-in-the-idaho-legislature-would-prohibit-absentee-ballot-drop-boxes/"> prohibiting the use of absentee ballot drop boxes</a>. “This legislation would prohibit the use of drop boxes or similar drop off locations to collect absentee ballots,” Giddings told the House State Affairs Committee on Friday. “We have seen across the country where these situations could allow ballot harvesting, but also there are concerns that these locations may be an opportunity for somebody to disrupt your ballots, whether it were to catch fire or flood or maybe food is stuffed in there and it could contaminate ballots as well and so just several considerations here where these are probably not the best way to collect ballots.”</p>
<p>Over the opposition of county clerks, election workers, high school students looking ahead to their first chance to vote, and more, the House State Affairs Committee has voted 9-2 along party lines to advance a<a href="https://www.idahopress.com/eyeonboise/sweeping-package-of-emergency-changes-to-idaho-voting-laws-clears-house-panel-on-party-line/article_ef7bf8b1-9a8c-517c-bb82-24d831ccd651.html"> sweeping 20-page emergency overhaul of Idaho’s voting laws</a> proposed by Rep. Dorothy Moon, R-Stanley. Moon’s bill, HB 692, was introduced Monday. The bill also makes numerous other changes to voting and registration procedures, requires new and different documents including proof of residency and citizenship such as birth certificates to be presented at the polls to vote, imposes new requirements on military and overseas voters, creates a new free, four-year state ID card that Moon estimated would cost the state just $200,000 next year, and more. It also does away with Idaho’s voter ID law that allows those without proof of identification to sign an affidavit. All the public testimony on Moon’s bill was against it. Asa Gray, elections manager for Kootenai County, said, “While I believe this legislation has the positive intention of continuing to keep Idaho elections safe and secure, it contains some flaws which lend themselves more to the disruption of the election process than to the security of it.”</p>

Sen. Richard Hilderbrand introduced <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2021_22/measures/sb389/">Senate Bill 389</a>, touting it as a simple addition to ensure elections in Kansas remain safe and secure. Currently, Kansas statute requires a stamp by the election clerk to be physically put on the ballot. Hilderbrand did not want to leave this process up to chance. While the state would not incur any costs if the measure is passed, both the Secretary of State’s Office and the Kansas Association of Counties estimated equipment costs and ballot printing, in addition to additional wages to be paid to election board workers, would set counties back. Others raised concerns about a signature provision’s implications for Kansans with disabilities. The Kansas Association of Counties testified neutrally on the bill but asked that the statute look out for local government budgets and not require significant capital purchases for their offices. Sen. Alicia Straub, an Ellinwood Republican, was also uneasy about the potential costs.</p>

According to the Detroit Free Press, the letter said, in part: &#8220;As we face another major election year with insufficient funding, continued high volume of absentee voting, and increased scrutiny due to the 2020 cycle, we need our leadership to focus on problem-solving rather than political wins and losses,&#8221; reads the<a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MISOS/2022/02/28/file_attachments/2089443/Open%20Letter%20to%20MI%20Leaders-Clerks-2.28.22.pdf"> letter from leaders of Michigan&#8217;s county and municipal clerks associations</a>. &#8220;Now is the time for state leaders in the executive and legislative branches to set aside their agendas and come together to consider reasonable improvements that will benefit our voters.&#8221; The letter lays out several changes election officials say are needed to achieve that goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding to help election officials handle the surge in absentee voting, including funding for security systems to monitor absentee ballot drop boxes and cover postage costs associated with absentee voting.</li>
<li>Allowing election officials to pre-process absentee ballots before Election Day to provide election results in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Creating an early voting option for Michigan voters. Michigan does not currently have an option for voters to cast their ballots in-person before Election Day.</li>
<li>Requiring election challengers to undergo training while ensuring access for challengers to observe the election process.</li>

The legislation mirrors efforts by Republican legislatures across the country after a foundation funded by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the Center for Tech and Civic Life, awarded $400 million in donations to help local governments facilitate the 2020 election amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Minnesota proposal, authored by Republican Sen. Mark Koran, of North Branch, would prohibit counties, municipalities and school districts from using funds from nonprofits and for-profit businesses to conduct elections.</p>
<p>State Sen. Carrie Rudd, R-Breezy Point, introduced a bill to “ensure fair and safe elections in Minnesota,” according to a news release. The bill would require a<a href="https://darik.news/minnesota/rudd-introduces-minnesota-election-integrity-act-brainerd-dispatch/202203533493.html"> photo ID to vote, establish a provisional ballot, and restrict certain methods of compensation related to absentee voting</a>. The bill requires proof of identity to vote for the language and to register on the same day. Forms of ID allowed include proof of receipt for a driver’s license, US military ID card, passport, tribal-issued ID card, a free voter’s ID card, or a new valid driver’s license. Individuals unable to provide valid proof of identity or residence will be able to cast a provisional ballot, giving the voter the period in which they can obtain valid identification. Voter registration will continue on the same day. Not a single legal voter shall be deprived of the requirements of voter ID, the release said. The bill was referred to the Senate State Government Committee.</p>

A proposal sponsored by Rep. J. Eggleston, R-Maysville, would raise the bar for passage of constitutional amendments from a simple majority to a two-thirds majority. However, voters could still repeal previously approved constitutional amendments by a simple majority, Eggleston said. Lawmakers gave the measure first-round approval on a voice vote. Unlike some of the other proposals, the increased requirements would apply to both amendments proposed by lawmakers and by voters through the petition process. Signatures to place a question on the ballot would have to come from all eight Missouri congressional districts, as opposed to the six currently required. The amendment also institutes a process for the General Assembly to vet proposed amendments by conducting hearings and potentially recommending changes.</p>
<p>A provision to allow<a href="https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/missouri-legislature-unlikely-to-expand-early-voting-despite-its-popularity/article_d7323c66-94b7-11ec-8279-1765bfdf9195.html"> in-person absentee voting without a stated reason</a> was left out of a key piece of elections legislation in the House. HB 2140, sponsored by Rep. Peggy McGaugh, R-Carrollton, was voted out of committee without the absentee provision initially included in the bill, though McGaugh personally hopes to see the measure added later in the process. House Elections Committee Chairman Dan Shaul, R-Imperial, said the absentee provision was left off the bill in order to send the Senate a noncontroversial bill that could be passed quickly. It was left out of the House’s proposed elections package that includes photo identification, Secretary of State audit powers and a move to paper ballots. The Missouri Association of County Clerks and Elections Authorities supports broader absentee options. Shane Schoeller, the association’s president, said at hearings on elections legislation that there are benefits to no-excuse absentee voting for election administration.</p>

Even those who testified in support of Legislative Bill 1181 called it just a start in dealing with concerns about the security and integrity of those ballots. The bill and other election-related measures have been introduced despite repeated assurances from the state’s top election official that his office has found no evidence supporting allegations of fraud in the 2020 election. LB 1181 was originally introduced by State Sen. Mike Groene of North Platte. Sen. John Lowe of Kearney picked up the measure after Groene resigned. Lowe said he took on the bill to keep discussion about election issues alive. “We need to find a way to work together to ease the fears of the citizens,” he said. Lowe said LB 1181 proposes an idea that could make voters feel more comfortable with mail-in ballots without creating significant barriers to using that option. Under the bill, the envelopes used for mail-in ballots would be required to have a separate, sealable pouch on the outside. Voters would have to use the pouch to provide a copy of some identification document. Identification options could include a driver’s license or state identification card or a bank statement, paycheck, utility bill or other government document dated within 60 days that includes the same name and address listed on the voter registration rolls. The options would be similar to the documentation required when a person first registers to vote. Nebraska does not require identification for in-person voting.</p>

A majority of the election regulations — 18 of 30 — were approved without further discussion, and another four were approved unanimously after concerns raised by commission members were addressed by Deputy Secretary of State for Elections Mark Wlaschin. According to the Nevada Independent, two proposed regulations were held up after the commission deadlocked on them. One of the held up regulations would have repealed old provisions requiring voters to request an absentee ballot to conform with a AB321. The other failed regulation would have set certain requirements for training on signature verification for clerks and staff members who administer elections.</p>

Currently, if the machine detects an &#8220;overvote&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t count the votes for anyone for that race, though it does process the rest of the ballot. The amended bill presented would require that these machines kick out any ballot that appears to have votes for too many candidates for a single office. This ballot would then be placed in an &#8220;auxiliary bin&#8221; to be hand-counted by local election officials after the polls have closed. Rep. Marjorie Porter, D-Hillsborough, the chief architect of the reform measure believes if this process had been in place in 2020 it would have found the issues that forced an audit of Windham’s 2020 election results.</p>

Sean Roberts, R-Hominy.  The bill originally would have required about 2.2 million Oklahoma voters to register and show proof of U.S. citizenship to vote after 2023. After hearing concerns from Election Secretary Paul Ziriax over cost, constitutionality and burdens it could place on many Oklahomans — particularly the elderly — the committee removed that provision.  Lawmakers did advance a stripped-down version that would set aside at least $1.1 million for a system to verify driver license numbers or the last four digits of Social Security numbers on voter registration applications. It would also create a felony charge for those who remove, obstruct the view or restrict the movement of poll watchers. The amended bill ended up advancing on a 6-2 party-line vote.</p>

The measure also allows approved third-party organizations to securely submit registration cards electronically on behalf of individuals, enabling Oregon’s existing voter registration system to work seamlessly with national voter registration tools, they said. “This gap in our law creates an additional barrier to voter registration for Oregonians without a state-issued ID,” said Senator Akasha Lawrence Spence (D-Portland), Co-Chief Sponsor of House Bill 4133, who carried the bill on the Senate floor. “These are folks who are often from the same groups of Oregonians who are historically underrepresented in our elections — our service members, seniors, low-income people, people of color and young people.”</p>

Lawmakers passed the bill, sponsored by House Speaker Jay Lucas, R-Darlington, in the wake of a record breaking number of absentee ballots cast in 2020. South Carolina offered no-excuse absentee voting because of the ongoing pandemic. As a result, more than a million residents took advantage. Under current law, South Carolina voters can only cast absentee ballots if they meet certain criteria, such as a disability or older than 65 years old. The House bill would set a permanent, no-excuse necessary in-person voting period Monday through Saturday, 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., in the two weeks ahead of general elections, primaries, primary runoffs, special and municipal elections. Voters who look to vote absentee by mail, however, would still be required to have an excuse. The bill also contains provisions that would allow election workers to begin tallying absentee ballots one day earlier than is currently allowed. Specifically, election workers would be allowed to look at outer envelopes of returned absentee ballots the Sunday before Election Day, and they would be allowed to begin counting ballots the Monday morning before. Lawmakers voted Wednesday to add a provision to the bill that would let poll watchers be present during that vote counting process.</p>

<p>One bill would allow nursing home workers to assist with voting during a pandemic if special voting deputies could not visit the facilities. The nursing care workers would be required to get training on voting. They could assist registered voters to fill out ballots but would be barred from helping residents register to vote.</p>
<p>Under another measure, voters could be marked as ineligible to vote if their names or other information did not match what&#8217;s on their driver&#8217;s license.</p>
<p>Another bill also requires voters to provide a copy of their photo identification each time they request an absentee ballot. Current law requires voters to present an ID the first time only.</p>
<p>That legislation would also bar election officials from sending voters unsolicited absentee ballot applications. In 2020, the Elections Commission sent applications to all registered voters.</p>
<p>Election clerks would no longer be allowed to fill in missing information, such as addresses, on absentee ballot envelopes under another measure.</p>
<p>One bill that allows election clerks to begin counting absentee ballots on the Monday before an election could have earned bipartisan support Thursday. But after hours of negotiations, the two parties ultimately disagreed because of new language Republicans added that requires clerks to send out absentee ballots for federal races no later than 21 days before an election instead of 47 days under current law.</p>
<p>Lawmakers also advanced three proposed constitutional amendments that must be approved during a second legislative session and by voters, and cannot be vetoed by Evers. One amendment would bar election officials from using private grant funding to administer elections. A second amendment would enshrine into the state constitution the state&#8217;s photo identification requirement for voting. And a third amendment would bar non-U.S. citizens from voting, which is already banned under federal law.</p>

In a lawsuit filed Friday, the party argues that the only constitutional form of voting is in person at the polls on Election Day — a mantra repeated by many who falsely believe the 2020 election was fraudulent and a position echoed in several bills introduced at the Legislature this year. Late Monday, the court accepted the suit, outlined mid-March deadlines for filing briefs and indicated it would determine the matter without holding oral arguments.  The suit names Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and the state in general as defendants. In its filing, the GOP asks the court to strike down both absentee and no-excuse mail-in voting. If the court won&#8217;t go that far, the lawsuit asks the court to declare six provisions of the existing system unconstitutional, including the 1991 creation of vote-by-mail for any voter who chooses that option. In 2020, state elections officials say that 89% of voters cast early ballots, either by mail, depositing them in a drop box or dropping them off at the polls on Election Day. The suit also faults Hobbs for what it says are unconstitutional moves authorizing the use of ballot drop boxes in 2020 and for failing to put uniform procedures for verifying voters&#8217; signatures on early ballots in the state&#8217;s Elections Procedures Manual.</p>
<p>Maricopa County Judge Joan Sinclair rejected a motion that would have blocked state Attorney General Mark Brnovich from pursuing criminal action against Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs over her plans to take a<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-declines-to-block-arizona-ag-threat-to-prosecute-elections-chief-over-system-takedown/"> candidate signature-gathering system</a> offline for maintenance. Sinclair denied the motion for a preliminary injunction on narrow grounds after a day of consideration <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/arizona-secretary-of-state-urges-judge-to-halt-ag-prosecution-threat-over-election-system-maintenance/">following oral arguments</a> earlier in the week. Sinclair found that while the secretary clearly viewed Brnovich’s letter as a threat, it &#8220;did not promise or guarantee prosecution and thus does not create a controversy properly before the court.&#8221; The findings also confirmed the attorney general is the chief enforcement officer in any election for state office. “It is simply unknown if action taken in the future by the AG would be lawful or not,” Sinclair said. “Any ruling by the court would be mere speculation. “</p>

Assistant Clerk-Recorder Natalie Adona and administrative assistant Suzanne Hardin were granted temporary workplace restraining orders following the Jan. 20 incident involving Teine Rebane Kenney, and Jacquelyn and Chip Mattoon. The temporary order was granted to protect Hardin and Adona after the interaction between Hardin and Kenney and the Mattoons became physical. “Nobody may argue or discuss if mask mandates in place were bold and unlawful, exceeded authority — nothing like that,” Bradrick said. “The only thing that can be stated is, ‘A mask mandate was in place.’” According to Hardin’s testimony, the administrative assistant opened the office door a crack — seven inches, when asked to specify — and was attempting to reiterate her office’s mask policies when Kenney yelled, “I’m coming in.” “The door slammed into my arm and my body, and I pushed back,” Hardin said. “(Kenney) shoved her arm and foot into the door — that’s why I was so intimidated — then I realized I was pushing a door on a human being and so I took a step back.” Hardin said the entire situation — the yelling in the hallway and the interaction itself — inspired fear. She returned to her coworker’s car after the interaction and wept, she said. Adona said she’s had several panic attacks since the interaction, and that she has felt isolated and depressed.</p>

The case, filed by the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office and Mesa County resident Heidi Hess, is similar to a lawsuit the two filed against Peters in August to remove Peters as the county’s chief election official, but only for the 2021 Coordinated Elections. Robison presided over that case, and ultimately ruled in their favor that Peters was unfit to act as the county’s designated election office, at least temporarily. The new lawsuit was filed in January after the embattled clerk rejected an agreement offer from Secretary of State Jena Griswold that would have allowed Peters to retake control of the county’s Election Division, but only under strict circumstances. In the original case, the<a href="https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/western_colorado/ags-office-files-opening-brief-in-case-to-remove-peters-as-election-official/article_b04bc49a-9a67-11ec-8886-33a04aed54d9.html"> state’s attorney general filed a brief this week</a> Chief Deputy Attorney General Natalie Leh wrote that Peters continues to show no remorse for alleged breaches of election security, and has made it clear she won’t change her stance on election integrity. As a result, Leh is asking Robison to repeat her order from last fall that temporarily removed Peters and Deputy Clerk Belinda Knisley from overseeing the 2021 election, and extend it to include the upcoming June primary election and 2022 general election in November. “Mesa County now faces a similarly unanticipated situation,” Leh wrote, referring to Peters’ actions last year that led to her being removed as an election official, and the numerous criminal investigations into her actions, including a local grand jury probe.</p>

The judge cited Peters with &#8220;indirect contempt,&#8221; meaning contempt that happens in direct sight or hearing of the court (judge), but not contempt that the court (judge) hears or sees. The citation is for &#8220;indirect contempt&#8221; because the judge did not have firsthand knowledge of the alleged recording.</p>
<p>A group of Colorado Republicans filed a federal lawsuit Feb. 24 asking a judge to block Secretary of State Jena Griswold from<a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/local-politics/colorado-unaffiliated-primaries-republican-lawsuit/73-5dcf8b43-6929-48c1-88cb-cf834e22ca41"> enforcing Proposition 108</a>, which allows unaffiliated voters to participate in primary elections. The five state lawmakers and candidates said Prop 108, which was passed by state voters in 2016, violates their First and 14th Amendment rights by allowing voters not affiliated with the party to vote in the GOP primary. The lawsuit claims that the plaintiff&#8217;s rights of free speech include the right to choose their political party&#8217;s nominees &#8220;without interference by those who are not members of the party and have chosen not to affiliate with the party.&#8221; &#8220;Unaffiliated voters have been encouraged to vote in Republican primaries to defeat candidates preferred by Republican Party voters,&#8221; the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit also claims that Prop 108 violates their right to equal protection under the 14th Amendment by &#8220;diluting the votes&#8221; of affiliated Republican voters. The plaintiffs asked the court for an injunction to stop Griswold and others from enforcing Proposition 108 and to declare the measure unconstitutional. Proposition 108 allows unaffiliated voters to vote in the primary election of a major political party. Voters are mailed the primary ballots for Republicans and Democrats, then can choose to fill out and return one of them.</p>

The lawsuit claims the way state lawmakers expanded access to elections hasn’t always been constitutional. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim early voting and permanent absentee voting provisions conflict with the text in the state constitution. Brady is filing the lawsuit on behalf of Michael Mennella, who’s served as an inspector of elections for the state for the last five to six years. “Really what Mr. Mannella is seeking is an order of the court clarifying what his duties are so that he’s in compliance,” she says. Brady says she only became aware of the potential legal ramifications eight months ago, and began investigating them. Brady insists this isn’t meant to be political, but to provide clarity on existing laws. The lawsuit also only applies to the general election, not primary elections or special elections, including the special election scheduled for March 5th.</p>

The ruling comes in a case that combines three lawsuits that allege the redistricting process violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by failing to include enough majority-minority districts that would give Black voters the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. &#8220;With candidate qualifying for the State of Georgia set to begin in six days, any change now would be considered late in the process,&#8221; Jones wrote. &#8220;Applying the Purcell principle, the United States Supreme Court &#8216;has also repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election.'&#8221;</p>

The provision was one of several components of a controversial election law, House Bill 2332, challenged last year in federal court. In November, the out-of-state ban was temporarily blocked, as was a provision barring applications from being sent if information is already filled out on them. Under the permanent injunction approved Friday by U.S. District Court Judge Kathryn Vratil, the state will no longer seek to enforce the out-of-state mailing ban, effectively ending that portion of the lawsuit.  Parts of the lawsuit targeting other sections of the bill will proceed.</p>

The lawsuits filed in district court in Carson City last month both allege that the descriptions of the ballot measures proposed by “Repair the Vote” PAC are argumentative, confusing and misleading, and therefore, violate Nevada law. “Descriptions of effect” are 200-word summaries included on signature-gathering forms for ballot questions, and are often challenged by political opponents. The attorneys filing on behalf of Eric Jeng and Emily Persaud-Zamora, two progressive community activists in Nevada, are asking the court to prohibit the secretary of state “from placing the petition[s] on the 2022 general election ballot, or from taking any further action on it.” The lawsuit challenging the initiative argues that though petitioners characterize it as a “voter integrity” measure, the description contains no information on the measure&#8217;s effect on voters’ ability to cast a ballot. Attorneys added that the law’s implementation would likely be costly, violating the Nevada Constitution’s ban on ballot initiatives requiring the state to spend significant money without a dedicated funding source. The other petition, also filed by Repair the Vote PAC, aims to repeal portions of<a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/81st2021/Bill/7842/Overview"> AB321</a>, a bill passed during the 2021 legislative session that makes permanent a system of expanded mail balloting used during the 2020 election cycle. The referendum focuses only on the portions that direct clerks to send mail ballots to all active registered voters unless they opt out, and that allow other people to turn in a ballot on behalf of a voter if the voter allows — a practice known as “ballot collection” or “ballot harvesting.”</p>

The BOE wants until March 28th to respond to the plaintiffs’ claim citing the ongoing redistricting process, their limited meeting schedule and a desire to pick their own representation. The suit was filed in Richmond County State Supreme Court by plaintiffs led by Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella, and argued the law violates the state constitution and state election laws. The defendants include Mayor Eric Adams, the City Council and the city BOE. In court papers, the city Law Department noted it was only appearing on behalf of the BOE “for the limited purpose of requesting additional time” so that the agency could retain and consult with an outside attorney before filing a response to the complaint.</p>

If the Commonwealth Court’s ruling stands, the 2-year-old voting law would no longer be in effect as of March 15 — a week after the Supreme Court is expected to hear oral argument in the case. Lawyers for the Department of State and Acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman argued in a filing that eliminating mail-in voting ahead of the spring primary season “would, if anything, only exacerbate voter confusion and the danger of disenfranchisement.” Three Republican judges on a Commonwealth Court panel of five sided with Republican challengers and ruled in January that no-excuse mail-in voting is prohibited under the Pennsylvania Constitution. The two Democratic judges on the panel dissented, writing that the constitution permits no-excuse under a provision that says elections “shall be by ballot or by such other method as may be prescribed by law.” The justices issued a one-paragraph order that overturned a Feb. 16 decision by Commonwealth Court Senior Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt that would have pulled the plug on the state’s 2-year-old voting law. The Supreme Court plans to hold oral argument Tuesday regarding the legal challenge the law. The justices’ decision to invalidate Leavitt’s order gives themselves more time to rule without facing a one-week deadline. They said the<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2022/03/pa-justices-keep-mail-in-voting-law-in-place-at-least-for-now.html"> law will remain in place, pending further action by the high court</a>.</p>

The petition came three days after U.S. District Judge Jennifer P. Wilson in Harrisburg denied their request for a temporary restraining order against the 17-district map, saying she first would sort out “jurisdictional issues.” The six plaintiffs said those issues concern whether they have standing to challenge the map.

Mark Ward has granted a motion for a new trial for Pamela Moses, who was sentenced to six years after being convicted of<a href="https://www.localmemphis.com/article/news/local/memphis-woman-sentenced-to-6-years-illegally-registering-vote-granted-new-trial/522-57163d29-160c-4d75-a67f-77a41de32152"> illegally registering to vote</a>. Moses was convicted in November 2021 of filing documents in 2019 to have her voting rights restored while still serving probation on a 2015 conviction. During sentencing in January 2022, the Shelby County District Attorney&#8217;s Office said 44-year-old Moses had 16 prior felony convictions and committed the voting offense in 2019 while on probation. At the time, the judge said that if she completes programs in prison and maintains good behavior, he&#8217;d consider placing her on probation after nine months. Ward said evidence presented during the trial that Moses had been convicted of a felony in 2000 and had her right to vote restored in 2014 should not have been allowed. He reasoned that the evidence was initially allowed and proper when Moses faced 12 counts of illegal voting, but it should have been disallowed when the prosecution dropped those 12 charges before the trial got underway. Ward also cited a Brady violation regarding an email that should have been turned over to the defense. The judge did not say the violation was intentional, but did say information in the email could have been relevant at trial. He said he was treating it as “an inadvertent failure to provide discovery under Rule 16.”</p>
<p>According to the <em>Commercial Appeal,</em> the chairs of the Shelby County Election Commission and Shelby County Commission have<a href="https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2022/02/28/election-commission-county-commission-chairs-propose-voting-machine-compromise-end-lawsuit/6973994001/"> come up with a compromise on voting machines</a> that they hope will lead to the end of litigation between their two bodies, Election Chairman Brent Taylor announced. The compromise is simple: Voters at the polls will be offered the choice between using a ballot marking device or filling out a hand-marked paper ballot. “What both the County Commission and Election Commission want to make sure of is the election workers do not couch this in a way where we’re exhibiting a preference to where they cast their ballot,” Taylor said. The Election Commission sued the County Commission in September 2021 after the commission twice rejected resolutions to purchase voting machines for the county, sending resounding messages that its members favored hand-marked paper ballots over ballot marking devices. If the proposed compromise is approved, it would require the commission to purchase the same machines it earlier rejected, machines from vendor Election Systems &amp; Software, LLC, known as ES&amp;S, one of the four election equipment companies certified to sell in Tennessee.</p>
