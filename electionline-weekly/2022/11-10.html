							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Election Day 2022</strong><br />
<em>Another pretty typical Election Day despite the pre-election concerns</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4575" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-300x188.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay-768x482.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ElectionDay.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />While ballots are still being counted, races need to be certified and recounts and audits are on the horizon, Election Day 2022 is officially over.</p>
<p>The pre-election fears of vigilante poll watchers<a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/11/09/voting-was-largely-uneventful-despite-fears-of-intimidation-and-conspiracies"> failed to materialize</a> and while there were some isolated incidents of erratic behavior at polling places, that happens every election. Overall officials, poll workers, poll watchers and voters remained calm and patient.</p>
<p>Although problems like lines and malfunctioning equipment weren’t widespread, that didn’t stop the<a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/queens/ap-top-news/2022/11/09/post-election-misinformation-targets-arizona-pennsylvania0"> conspiracy theorists from kicking into high gear</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever over 100 million people do something, something will go wrong. That is human nature. It does not mean there is a conspiracy,&#8221; tweeted Michael McDonald, a political science professor at the University of Florida.</p>
<p>The week before Election Day, we listed<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/11-03/"> things that we would be keeping an eye on</a>, in addition to everything else. Here’s a quick look at some of those and also major headlines from the day. You can also look back at our<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/#tab-1"> Election Day Dispatches</a> for a more in-depth look. We’ll be back next week with a state-by-state breakdown of what happened and of course what didn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>Threats to Democracy</strong><br />
While the nation held its collective breath on Tuesday<a href="https://www.cbs58.com/news/how-election-officials-staved-off-chaos-at-polling-places-tuesday"> over fears of Election Day violence, none of that really seemed to materialize</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing everybody being adults,&#8221; said Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican. &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing the candidates be gracious and conceding and admitting they lost.&#8221; There were some isolated incidents of poll workers needing to be removed after complaints and in Wisconsin a man with a knife entered a polling place, but was <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9025" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/FlowerVote-300x143.png" alt="" width="300" height="143" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/FlowerVote-300x143.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/FlowerVote.png 678w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />quickly removed by police. But overall, elections officials were prepared. &#8220;Election officials were acutely aware of the tense environment in which they were operating,&#8221; said Nate Persily, an election law professor at Stanford University. &#8220;Although their procedures weren&#8217;t markedly different (from 2020), they knew they were being scrutinized both by legitimate forces and conspiracy theorists.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>On the Ballot</strong><br />
While some races are still being decided, here is a list of the winning secretary of state candidates: Alabama Wes Allen (R); Arkansas: John Thurston (R); California: Shirley Weber (D); Colorado: Jena Griswold (D); Connecticut: Stephanie Thomas (D); Georgia: Brad Raffensperger (R); Idaho: Phil McGrane (R); Indiana: Diego Morales (R); Iowa: Paul Pate (R); Massachusetts: William Galvin (D); Michigan: Jocelyn Benson (D); Minnesota: Steve Simon (D); Nebraska: Bob Evnen (R); New Mexico: Maggie Toulouse Oliver (D); North Dakota: Michael Howe (R); Ohio: Frank LaRose (R); Rhode Island: Gregg Amore (D); South Dakota: Monae Johnson (R); Vermont: Sara Copeland Hanzas (D); and Wyoming: Chuck Gray (R).</p>
<p>At press time, the races in Arizona, Nevada and Washington were too close to call with more ballots still to be counted. Additionally, in Wisconsin, Democrat Doug LaFollette is leading with the thinnest of margins. Although the secretary of state in Wisconsin does not oversee elections, the Republican-controlled state Legislature had vowed to disband the Wisconsin Election Commission and give the secretary of state oversight of elections if the Republican candidate won.</p>
<p>We’ll dig into the<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/politics/future-election-rules-ballot-measures/index.html"> ballot measures</a> next week.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong><br />
As of press time, most losing candidates have conceded their loss and accepted the results. There are still outstanding <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8677" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-300x250.png" alt="" width="300" height="250" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-300x250.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-1024x852.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted-768x639.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UlsterCoNYIVoted.png 1158w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />races to be decided, including in Arizona and Nevada. Whether losing candidates there will accept the results remains to be seen especially because they would not commit to that prior to Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>Redistricting</strong><br />
While there were some grumbles from voters over redistricting, there weren’t many reported problems with voters showing up at the wrong polling place en masse. In<a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/11/05/14681/"> Davidson County, Tennessee</a> more than 200 people were given the wrong ballots during early voting due to problems with redistricting. Those voters were offered the option to come back on Election Day and<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/08/nashville-ballot-errors-some-voters-show-up-to-correct/69631059007/"> vote a provisional ballot</a>, more than 100 of them took advantage of that opportunity. County Election Administrator Jeff Roberts said that<a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/thousands-of-nashville-voters-were-slated-to-receive-wrong-ballots-before-election-error-was-discovered"> more than 3,000 voters</a> could have been affected had the problem not been discovered during early voting.</p>
<p><strong>Displaced Voters</strong><br />
There weren’t any reports of major impacts with voters displaced by storms, although polling places in<a href="https://www.kosu.org/politics/2022-11-08/tornado-moves-southeast-oklahoma-polling-place-a-half-mile-up-the-road"> Oklahoma</a> and<a href="https://www.kltv.com/2022/11/08/hughes-springs-voting-location-moved-due-storm/"> Texas</a> had to be relocated after storms went through the area Monday night. In<a href="https://www.winknews.com/2022/11/09/lee-county-considering-election-process-overhaul/"> Lee County, Florida</a>, the county which suffered the greatest impact from Hurricane Ian, Supervisor of Elections Tommy Doyle said that it may be time to rethink how Florida handles post-storm elections. “A lot of people showed up on election day. But it was good! People were very appreciative. I was glad to see the lines, and everybody got to put their vote in,” said Doyle. He also believes the system could be improved upon, “We need more sites. 12 is not enough.” The county’s biggest problem was tracking data in real time. The real-time vote data wasn’t rebuilt to align with the voting location method, making it nearly impossible for voters <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8732" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LAIVoted22-227x300.png" alt="" width="227" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LAIVoted22-227x300.png 227w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LAIVoted22.png 738w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" />to follow races as the night wore on. It also created challenges for poll workers to know exactly how many votes were in and how many were still pending. Doyle believes with time to rebuild a new permanent system; the tracking issues would be solved. “As time goes on and once you start it, I think down the road it gets better and better.”</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong><br />
Every single election has some sort of technical issue with equipment and this year was no different. While there were minor issues scattered throughout the country, the two biggest problems occurred in<a href="https://arizona.votebeat.org/2022/11/8/23447436/maricopa-county-voting-problems-ballot-tabulators"> Maricopa County, Arizona</a> and<a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/09/mercer-county-nj-voting-machine-problems-elections/69634962007/"> Mercer County, New Jersey</a>. In Arizona’s largest county, the ballot scanners in about 20 percent of the county’s vote centers were not scanning on Election Day. Voters were still able to cast their paper ballots and put them in the emergency slot. The county is still currently working through processing and counting all of those ballots, as well as trying to figure out what exactly happened to the equipment. Needless to say, given the eyes on Maricopa, the equipment malfunction sent the conspiracy theorists and others into a tizzy, but County Recorder Stephen Richter and County Supervisor Bill Gates were quick to come out and explain what was happening and how the county was working through it. In New Jersey, Mercer County the issue was with precinct-based paper ballot scanners. None of them worked on Tuesday. Mercer County Clerk Paula Sollami-Covello said the paper ballot system meant that everyone could still vote “This allowed our election to go forward, and we took advantage of that fail-safe measure yesterday,” she said. “We were able to bring all of the ballots back to the Board of Elections, where that bipartisan commission processed the ballots&#8217; high-capacity scanners at their central location. Every vote was counted.” She has however reported an issue to the Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office to “investigate as to whether this scanning problem occurred based on an error or whether something was intentionally done to create chaos and distrust in the election system.”</p>
<p><strong>Lines</strong><br />
Interestingly enough, there were a lot of lines on Tuesday and most seemed to be simply from volume of voters. Some occurred in places like Maricopa County, as expected due to the equipment problems, but there were also reports of lines <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-8883" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/UnionCoNCIVoted-300x273.png" alt="" width="233" height="211" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/UnionCoNCIVoted-300x273.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/UnionCoNCIVoted.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" />in other places as well. Although election-denying activists had called on voters to show up at the polls as late as possible to create end of the day lines and chaos, that didn’t seem to occur. In<a href="https://local12.com/news/local/long-voting-lines-in-northern-kentucky-deterred-some-voters-from-casting-a-ballot-kenton-county-st-barbara-catholic-church-lakeside-christian-election-leaders-express-vote-machine-cincinnati-ohio"> Kentucky</a>, some voters were faced with lines throughout the day and seemed to have a bit of buyer’s remorse for not taking advantage of early voting. &#8220;It is a little frustrating and I guess I&#8217;m a little aggravated myself too, maybe I should have checked into this early voting more,” voter Jeff Hay told Local 12. In<a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2022/11/its-a-mess-behind-the-long-election-lines-at-the-university-of-michigan.html"> Michigan</a>, huge lines formed in Ann Arbor where many University of Michigan students waited till Election Day to vote. In Derry,<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/long-lines-traffic-derry-polls-new-hampshire-11822/41904741"> New Hampshire</a>, which had consolidated its polling places to one central site in 2020, people waited in long lines and police were called in to direct traffic. In Jefferson County,<a href="https://www.wwnytv.com/2022/11/09/line-disney-world-voters-surprised-by-lines-polls/"> New York</a>, one voter compared the lines to vote like one sees at Disney World. “I didn’t expect &#8211; I thought I’d just breeze in and breeze out. I didn’t expect to see this line out here,” said voter Olin Warren. In Bristol,<a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/decision-2022/bristol-brings-more-voting-booths-to-polling-locations-to-ease-lines-mayor/2911152/"> Connecticut</a> more voting booths were brought in to help ease the lines. Polling locations across Cuyahoga County,<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/election/2022/11/cuyahoga-county-voters-see-few-issues-on-election-day-but-long-lines-in-some-eastern-suburbs.html"> Ohio</a> saw a steady stream of voters and few issues on Tuesday, though some voters in the eastern suburbs were faced with long lines, primarily later in the day.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong><br />
Several jurisdictions including<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/08/2022-midterm-websites-mississippi-hit-cyber-attack/8308615001/"> Mississippi</a> and<a href="https://abc7chicago.com/champaign-county-clerk-what-is-ddos-attack-meaning/12430547/"> Champaign County, Illinois</a> suffered DDoS attacks on Election Day but those issues had no impact on voting or tabulating the ballots. And in<a href="https://bronx.news12.com/suffolk-county-votes-delivered-by-hand-due-to-concerns-over-recent-cyberattack"> Suffolk County, New York</a> where the county had <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8105" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-300x232.png" alt="" width="300" height="232" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-300x232.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted-768x593.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/HarrisCoIVoted.png 922w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />been victim of a recent ransomware attack, while voting was not impacted, officials did have to rely on the state’s site for posting results and physical ballots were driven to a central location for tabulating. “We have seen no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was any way compromised in any race in the country,” said CISA director Jenn Easterly.  “Right now, election officials are tabulating votes, reviewing procedures, and testing and auditing equipment as part of the rigorous post-Election Day process that goes into finalizing and certifying the results. It’s important to remember that this thorough and deliberative process can take days or weeks, depending on state laws; these rigorous procedures are why the American people can have confidence in the security and integrity of the election. We urge everyone to look towards your state and local election officials for the most accurate and up-to-date information about vote counts and to remain patient as election officials continue to do their jobs and carry out the certification process.”</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9024" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fairvote.png" alt="" width="176" height="194" /> New Report</strong>: Fairvote has released a new report on<a href="https://fairvote.org/report/election-recounts-2022/"> statewide election recounts from 2000-2022</a>. This report examines 22 years of statewide recounts in the United States, quantifies various aspects of statewide recounts, and makes recommendations for policymakers creating recount statutes. In the 6,297 statewide general elections from 2000 through September 2022, there were 35 completed statewide recounts. Only three of those 35 recounts overturned the outcome of the race. In all three, the original margin of victory was less than 0.06%. The report authors recommend that states automatically conduct statewide recounts up to a 0.1% margin as a best practice. They also note the troubling recent trend of recounts well outside the range where they could be considered consequential &#8212; including in this year&#8217;s Nevada Republican gubernatorial primary (11% margin) and Colorado Republican Secretary of State primary (14% margin), and for Kansas&#8217;s &#8220;No Constitutional Right to Abortion&#8221; ballot measure (19% margin). Key findings include: Statewide recounts are rare. There were 35 recounts in this time period out of over 6,000 elections. Outcome reversals are even rarer. Recounts have resulted in only three reversals, or one out of every 2,099 statewide elections. All reversals occurred in races where the original margin of victory was less than 0.1%. Recounts tend to shift only a small number of votes. Statewide recounts resulted in an average margin shift of 1,034 votes between the frontrunner candidates, representing just 0.046% of the total votes in those elections. An upper threshold should be established for campaign-requested recounts in order to prevent frivolous recounts. The recent trend of recounts in races with no realistic possibility of an outcome reversal reveal a flaw in the current recount statutes in many states. Recount laws should go hand-in-hand with rigorous post-election audit procedures. While full recounts should be rare, post-election audits should be the norm.</p>

She jokingly says most poll workers don’t even know they get paid. They do it out of a sense of civic responsibility. The rate of pay was raised to $11 per hour. “which isn’t enough, but over the years we have tried to raise that rate of pay for our poll workers because they do carry a hug responsibility on election day,” said Glascock.</p>

Tripp County Commissioner Joyce Kartak made the motion and Dan Forgey seconded the motion to hand count the ballots. The motion came after an hour and 45 minute discussion was held on the concerns of the elections and the machine used to count the ballots, according to minutes from the Tripp County Commission. County Auditor Barb DeSarsa said she’s found some volunteers to help count hand count the  ballots which will counted by hand at the precinct sites, she said. “I thought that was the best way,” DeSarsa said.</p>

Burlington voters struck down a similar proposal in 2015, but Councilor Ben Traverse said a lot has changed in the last 7 years. “I think people view democracy, and the ability to participate in elections, differently,” he said. The committee is also considering expanding RCV to mayoral and School Board elections. The committee voted 2-1 to advance the ranked choice expansion to the full council. Councilor Sarah Carpenter voted no. “My constituents are still very leery of the system, and I want to give them time to see it in action,” she said. Traverse voted in favor of expanding RCV, but he’s worried Mayor Miro Weinberger will veto it like he did in 2020.</p>

McGinley<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-arizona-government-and-politics-714a45e76973de132c84cbde0ca5c1b2"> blocked Cochise County’s plan to conduct a full hand-count of ballots</a> from the current election — a measure requested by Republican officials who expressed unfounded concerns that vote-counting machines are untrustworthy. The ruling came after<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-arizona-government-and-politics-a00d2f701cb51f6938ae20e46bfded4e"> a full-day hearing</a> on Friday during which opponents presented their case and called witnesses. McGinley said the county board of supervisors overstepped its legal authority by ordering the county recorder to count all the ballots cast in the election that concludes on Tuesday rather than the small sample required by state law. The lawsuit only challenged a full hand-count of an estimated 30,000 early ballots, but the ruling went further by blocking hand-counts of both the early ballots and those cast on Election Day.</p>
<p>McGinley wrote that state election laws lay out a detailed procedure for randomly choosing which Election Day ballots are chosen for the standard hand-count. “This entire process would be rendered superfluous if the court were to construe (that section) to initially select 100% of the precinct ballots as its starting point,” the judge wrote. “Because the statute does not permit elections officials to begin the precinct hand-count by counting all ballots cast, the Board’s requirement that elections officials do so here is unlawful.”</p>
<p>The state’s Citizens Clean Elections Commission has been fighting to<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1822627/citizens-clean-elections-commission-asks-restraining-order-vs-clean-elections-usa"> stop a conservative advocacy group from using a similar name</a>. And the state commission now wants immediate action, in the form of a restraining order. The conservative group Clean Elections USA has been monitoring drop boxes in Maricopa County and alleging that the 2020 election was fraudulent. Commission director Tom Collins said the group’s name has caused confusion, leading Arizona residents to believe the state commission is the one monitoring the drop boxes. A lawsuit filed by the commission cites a post titled “10 plus ways the election was rigged in Maricopa County.” Collins says while that is not only inaccurate, it is causing people to believe that is the position of the state commission.</p>

Eugene Yu, chief executive of Konnech Inc, was charged last month with two felonies for allegedly violating the company&#8217;s contract with Los Angeles County by transferring election workers&#8217; personal information to servers in China. The Los Angeles District Attorney&#8217;s Office, which brought the charges, has acknowledged starting the investigation due to a complaint from Gregg Phillips of True the Vote, a Texas nonprofit and prominent purveyor of baseless voter-fraud claims. The District Attorney&#8217;s Office said it sought to dismiss the case, citing an unspecified bias. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge granted the dismissal without prejudice, meaning charges can be refiled in future. &#8220;We are concerned about both the pace of the investigation and the potential bias in the presentation and investigation of the evidence,&#8221; the office said in a statement. &#8220;As a result, we have decided to ask the court to dismiss the current case, and alert the public in order to ensure transparency.&#8221;</p>

The lawsuit comes after Cobb election officials acknowledged that they failed to mail absentee ballots to 1,036 voters who had requested them. “Hundreds of eligible Cobb County voters did everything right and yet find themselves on the brink of total disenfranchisement because they were never mailed their absentee ballots, as is required under Georgia law,” said Jonathan Topaz, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s Voting Rights Project. The lawsuit was filed in Superior Court by four voters living out of state who weren’t mailed absentee ballots and the Cobb County Democracy Center, a voter education organization. Without relief from the courts, it’s unlikely that voters will be able to return their ballots in time to be counted, the lawsuit said. Under Georgia law, absentee ballots must be received at election offices by the time polls close on Tuesday, with a later deadline of Nov. 14 for military and overseas voters. Cobb County Superior Court Judge Kellie Hill<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/07/georgia-election-lawsuit-sparks-absentee-ballot-investigation.html"> ordered the county Board of Elections and Registration to send via overnight delivery</a> Monday replacement ballots to affected voters who had not already been sent replacement ballots. And Hill ordered that any of the affected voters would be allowed to vote in person, by replacement ballot, or by federal write-in absentee ballot. The order was agreed to by county election officials after a hearing before Hill on Monday</p>

Lawyers representing Champaign County Board member Jim McGuire filed a lawsuit alleging that Champaign County deputy clerk Michelle Jett mishandled official ballots. Attached to the lawsuit is a sworn affidavit from an election judge in County Clerk Aaron Ammons’ office, which included pictures of ballots on the passenger seat and floor of Jett’s car. The election judge could not see exactly how many ballots were unsealed in the car and did not try to speculate as to why the ballots were unsealed in the car, to begin with. “As an election judge, I understand that there is no lawful explanation for a collection of unsealed official ballots to be stored in the condition I observed,” the election judge wrote in the affidavit. Within hours of the lawsuit being filed, Circuit Judge Anna Benjamin issued an emergency temporary restraining order, which ordered Jett to be stripped of all of her election-day duties. The judge threw out the order after Jett and the county provided evidence they were sample ballots being used to test voting machines.</p>

The Michigan Supreme Court&#8217;s order leaves in place for the general election the same poll challenger guidelines used in the recent August primary. In a statement concurring with the Michigan Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to suspend the lower court order, Justice Elizabeth Welch — a Democratic-nominated justice — chided those who brought the lawsuits for waiting until late September to file them. &#8220;The general election is now less than one week away.

The judge said the suit “failed dramatically,” and that the claims made by Karamo were “unsubstantiated and/or misinterpret Michigan election law.” “Plaintiffs have raised a false flag of election law violations and corruption concerning Detroit’s procedures for the November 8th election. This Court’s ruling takes down that flag,” a Wayne County circuit court ruling reads. “Plaintiffs’ failure to produce any evidence that the procedures for this November 8th election violate state or federal election law demonizes the Detroit City Clerk, her office staff, and the 1,200 volunteers working this election. These claims are unjustified, devoid of any evidentiary basis and cannot be allowed to stand.”</p>

The Jefferson City circuit judge hit pause on rules that banned groups from paying volunteers to hand out voter registration applications, required groups seeking to sign up more than 10 voters to register with the state, and mandated those volunteers be Missouri voters themselves. Beetem wrote that the League of Women Voters and Missouri NAACP, who sued in August to block the law, had &#8220;sufficiently alleged&#8221; that the parts of the law in question &#8220;chill their protected speech.&#8221; The law, passed by the Republican-led legislature this past year, is House Bill 1878. &#8220;Plaintiffs argue, and (attorneys with the state) do not contest, that no other state has a restriction on voter engagement speech that even approaches the breadth of this statute,&#8221; Beetem wrote. &#8220;Such direct restraints on pure speech — and core political speech like encouraging political participation in particular ― are antithetical to the core tenets of freedom of speech.&#8221;</p>

Williams issued the order Thursday, a day after attorneys representing the RNC, Clark County and a cadre of Democratic groups argued the case  following oral arguments from the parties. In the order, Williams wrote that the RNC’s arguments that the county’s hiring of temporary employees to assist with signature verification did not constitute the creation of a “special election board,” a term defined in state law that requires membership to “represent all political parties as equally as possible.” He added that it would be a “big stretch” to classify those temporary employees as members of a special election board. “&#8230;Temporary employees do not have power to make decisions on ballot-counting procedures,” the order states. “Consequently, the temporary employees simply perform ministerial functions for the County, and by extension, the State of Nevada.”</p>

Owyhee will also have a ballot drop-box on Election Day. The lawsuit claimed that the limited early voting schedule “violates state law, and imposes constitutional burdens on their fundamental right to vote.” The Duck Valley tribes were assisted in the lawsuit by Four Directions Native Vote. “After meeting for several hours, the Tribes and Elko County settled the equal voting access lawsuit for all future elections with greatly expanded access for election 2022,” stated Four Directions.</p>

The plain language of Election Law g 4-104[5-a] which includes the word ‘shall’ (as opposed to ‘may’ or ‘should’) specifically mandates the designation of a voting polling place on a college or university campus where, as here. the petitioner demonstrated that the college or university campus contains three hundred or more registrants to vote at an address on such college or university campus.”</p>

The court’s separate time frame for absentee ballots appears to come from conflating those votes with a different kind of absentee ballot — the ones sent to military and overseas voters, known as UOCAVA for the federal law that governs them — which are sent out 70 days before Election Day, which is Aug. 30 this year.</p>

Voters finding their name on the list can cast a provisional ballot on Election Day only at the Davidson County Election Commission office, 1417 Murfreesboro Pike in Nashville, not at assigned Election Day polling locations. The ACLU of Tennessee filed a lawsuit, naming as defendants Roberts, the members of the Davidson County Election Commission, Gov. Bill Lee, Secretary of State Tre Hargett and state election coordinator Mark Goins. Within an hour of the suit being filed, the parties reached a legal agreement.</p>

They’d been held for contempt of court since Halloween, having repeatedly refused to release the name of a man they called a “confidential FBI informant” who is a person of interest in a defamation and hacking case against them.  The person remains unidentified.  Their release came after True the Vote’s lawyers appealed the contempt order by federal district Judge Kenneth Hoyt to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, arguing the finding of contempt was in error and the pair should be released from jail. The appeals court<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23278935-22-20578_documents-1"> granted</a> their release but kept the remainder of Hoyt’s order in place.</p>
<p>The Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday set the stage for a<a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/politics/elections/2022/11/09/437120/texas-supreme-court-ruling-opens-possibility-that-late-harris-county-ballots-wont-be-counted/"> legal fight over whether to count ballots Harris County voters cast during an extended hour of voting</a> ordered by a lower court. That lower court ordered that the state&#8217;s most populous county extend voting hours until 8 p.m. after several polling places were delayed in opening. The state&#8217;s<a href="https://www.txcourts.gov/supreme/orders-opinions/2022/november/november-8-2022/"> highest civil court blocked that ruling</a> and ordered Harris County to separate ballots cast by voters who were not in line by 7 p.m., the normal cutoff for voting in Texas. The Supreme Court&#8217;s order followed a request by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to reverse the lower court&#8217;s order. The Supreme Court<a href="https://twitter.com/SupremeCourt_TX/status/1590169843592212480?s=20&amp;t=tRlItKZU3bv6v-Fb9nW2Pw"> posted the order on Twitter</a> at 8:30 p.m. It&#8217;s unclear how many votes were cast during the extra hour of voting, but Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee raised the prospect that the state would ask for those votes to be thrown out. The attorney general&#8217;s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether they would pursue such action. Voters who got in line after 7 p.m. were required to cast a provisional ballot, which the county had already said would take more time to process and would not be initially counted in election night returns. Harris County is home to nearly 2.6 million registered voters.</p>

The party argued that Olsen and the board broke the law by failing to ensure that the<a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/siding-with-the-gop-judge-orders-election-office-to-reassign-staff-at-more-than-30/article_c97fcf6a-5c5e-11ed-80b5-47f949f1a1bb.html"> chief and assistant chief election officers at each polling place were evenly split</a> between the parties. In response, Olsen and the electoral board contend they “doubled” the overall number of Republican election officers working the polls on Tuesday as a result of a targeted mailers sent over the summer. But they said they assigned chief and assistant chiefs based on workers&#8217; experience with prior elections in an effort to ensure a smooth process on Election Day. The GOP Committee&#8217;s lawsuit stated the the party&#8217;s research into the voting records of election officers assigned to represent Republicans revealed that several had participated in past Democratic primaries. Virginia does not register voters according to political parties but keeps a record of voters’ participation in party primaries, which can be accessed for a fee from the Virginia Department of Elections.</p>
<p>A last-minute push to<a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/local-election-hq/effort-to-block-virginia-from-using-voting-machines-fails/"> upend how Virginia counts its votes was dismissed</a> Monday after the man behind the legal effort didn’t show up to court. James Renwick Manship filed an injunction to temporarily block the use of electronic voting machines used to count ballots in Virginia for years and have the Department of Elections “implement a state-wide Hand Count of Paper Ballots.” In his injunction, Manship called machines used to tabulate ballots in Virginia “exploitable” and “flawed” but did not provide specific evidence to back his claims. The Virginia Attorney General’s Office, led by Republican Jason Miyares, represented the state’s Department of Elections in the case. Miyares’ office argued in a motion to have the case thrown out that Manship’s allegations “are long on conspiracy and short on fact.”</p>

If convicted, Zapata faces up to 3 1/2 years in prison and a $10,000 fine on the Class I Felony count and six months behind bars and a $1,000 for each of the three misdemeanors, according to the complaint. Zapata was fired by Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson this week after city officials discovered she had requested three military ballots and had them sent to the home of state Rep. Janel Brandtjen of Menomonee Falls.</p>
<p>The conservative Thomas More Society, on behalf of veterans and Waukesha County voters, filed a lawsuit Friday asking a court to order Wisconsin elections officials to<a href="https://www.wbay.com/2022/11/05/lawsuit-asks-wisconsin-election-officials-sequester-military-ballots/"> sequester all military absentee and mail-in ballots</a>. The lawsuit asks the Waukesha County Circuit Court for a temporary injunction requiring elections officials to set aside military ballots so their authenticity can be verified. The suit was motivated by the case of a Milwaukee Election Commission deputy administrator, who was fired after admitting to fraudulently requesting military ballots. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Maxwell<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/07/lawsuit-asks-to-sequester-wisconsin-military-ballots-ahead-of-midterms/69624147007/"> denied the request</a>, calling the step a “drastic remedy” but also chiding the Wisconsin Elections Commission over its guidance to municipal clerks. “I think I made clear in my questioning that I felt that that was a drastic remedy, that I felt that it was at least at a minimum a temporary disenfranchisement of our military voters’ votes to say, &#8216;let’s put them on hold and let’s figure out after the fact whether or not there’s bad votes cast,&#8217;” Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Maxwell said at the end of a two-hour hearing.</p>
