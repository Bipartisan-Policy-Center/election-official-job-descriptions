														<p><strong>Exit Interview: Dana DeBeauvoir</strong><br />
<em>Travis Co., Texas clerk exits after more than 30 years on the job</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7969" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DanaDeBeauvoir-300x226.png" alt="" width="300" height="226" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DanaDeBeauvoir-300x226.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DanaDeBeauvoir.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Outgoing<a href="https://countyclerk.traviscountytx.gov/"> Travis County, Texas</a> Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir likes to joke that the office was still using quill pens when she arrived on the scene 36 years ago.</p>
<p>While that may be a bit of a stretch, elections in Travis County, and throughout the country have changed dramatically since 1986 and DeBeauvoir has been at the forefront.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, DeBeauvoir worked with computer and usability experts to write specifications for a new, open source voting system that provided a paper trail.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/event_document/files/Dana-Debeauvoir-STAR-Voting-System-Diagram.pdf"> STAR-Vote</a> system resolved common issues related to determining the intent-of-the-voter and managing early voting, mega voting, and election day centers. Lower costs and more flexible scalability are added by maximizing the use of commercial-off-the-shelf hardware.</p>
<p>Although<a href="https://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2017/10/star-vote-collapses/"> STAR-Vote</a> never really got off the ground in Travis County, it certainly helped make DeBeauvor a star in the elections community.</p>
<p>Pam Smith, senior advisor for<a href="https://verifiedvoting.org/"> Verified Voting</a> reminisced about a<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dana-debeauvoir-texas-county-clerk-voting-tech-revolution/"> keynote address DeBeauvoir gave for election technology experts at the EVT/WOTE in 2011</a> about the STAR-vote voting system DeBeauvoir had worked with election scientists to create.</p>
<p>“She held the room in thrall for an hour, and aside from the technical details, she said some magic words: ‘You’re the bright spots in my job, believe it or not…,’” Smith said. “That talk epitomized Dana. From her shout-out to her elections staff as preface, to the wit, humor and graciousness, to the collegiality and respect and clear vision that it will take all hands to make voting work—100% real. I’ve never known her to be otherwise.”</p>
<p>In addition to her duties in Travis County, DeBeauvoir has served as an advisor and election observer for Bosnia, the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, Kosovo, and the historic South Africa election that represented the end of apartheid.</p>
<p>And that’s what DeBeauvoir hopes to do in her retirement from Travis County, more international observing.</p>
<p>Electionline would like to wish Dana well in her future endeavors and a very happy birthday—which is tomorrow, which is also her last day as county clerk.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why have you chosen not to seek re-election?</em></strong><br />
I’ve served for 36 years as County Clerk. I worked for 3 ½ years before that in the Tax office.  That’s a long road.  It’s time.</p>
<p><strong><em>What are you most proud of during your tenure as clerk?</em></strong><br />
We took this office from the quill pen era to automated, modern management.  In 1987, there was little technology available.  We were still using typewriters and were thrilled when we got our first fax machine around 1990.  We can help many more people in the same number of work hours than we could in the early years.  I love that we’ve come so far.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you wish you&#8217;d been able to accomplish that you weren&#8217;t able to either because of budget or other reasons?</em></strong><br />
We are almost complete loading all the old records onto an internet platform for remote viewing.  I wish I had been able to finish uploading all the millions of records.  I came very close and the next County Clerk will be able to post online every record the Clerk’s office carries.</p>
<p><strong><em>More than a decade ago, you partnered with computer security experts to create the STAR voting system. Is that still your ideal voting system or if you were starting from scratch today would it look different?</em></strong><br />
STARVote was a massive undertaking born of frustration that as Election Administrators we could not purchase what voters were demanding—electronic voting with a paper trail.  The new voting systems today look very much like the STARVote design.  We were a little ahead of our time, but we were on the right track.  STARVote still lives and under a new name, Election Guard, DOD with DARPA funds is building the prototype.  Soon our idea of an open source voting system, with electronic inventory of ballots, non-ambiguous marks, E2E verification, and independent third party verification will be a reality.  And we hope that the jump-start that DOD has given the industry will reduce the cost of purchasing this new voting system.</p>
<p><strong><em>You&#8217;ve been a high profile woman in the elections community for a long time, what&#8217;s that been like? Has it changed over time? What advice would you give women who are interested in getting into election leadership?</em></strong><br />
Most of the time it’s been a fight—to be heard, and to achieve implementations.  The technology sector has always been a white male dominated world, and the women in the field know better than I how tough that world can be.  Success takes patience, spine, and a thick skin.  Thing are changing as more women and people of color join this sector and I am optimistic about the future.  There are already many women in the field of elections.  I think we are a rare bunch with special abilities in planning, juggling multiple tasks at one time, taking on naysayers and calming down the disturbed, and pulling off miracles.  For example, Election Administrators can run an election in the middle of Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p><strong><em>What&#8217;s one thing that you wish policymakers in Texas and Washington, DC knew about the election process?</em></strong><br />
I wish we didn’t have to deal with the political reality of voter suppression.  Congress and the Legislatures should be thinking more about the ease of voting and the welfare of voters, rather than their own political advantage.</p>
<p><strong><em>What will you miss about working election administration?</em></strong><br />
The voters.  That we lose both sunrise and sunset on Election Day.  Tireless and tenacious election staff.  The adrenelin.</p>
<p><strong><em>What&#8217;s next for you, other than sleeping in on Election Day?</em></strong><br />
I want to return to international election observation.  Seeing how elections are run around the world were some of the most inspiring moments of my life.  I can sleep when I’m really old.</p>

Submissions will be judged based on innovation, sustainability, outreach, cost-effectiveness, replicability, and the generation of positive results.</p>
<p>The 2021 Clearie winners will be announced in April 2022.</p>
<p>This year, EAC Commissioners are pleased to announce two new award categories honoring innovative programming developed by election official associations and successful Help America Vote Act (HAVA) grant initiatives. 2022 marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of HAVA, and the Commissioners hope to highlight the spirit of this landmark bipartisan legislation by recognizing innovative uses of HAVA funds. The prestigious new award will also help jurisdictions utilize these best practices to enhance future efforts.</p>
<p>The EAC will present awards in the categories of:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Outstanding Use of HAVA Grants in Elections Modernization,</li>
<li aria-level="1">Outstanding Election Official Association Program,</li>
<li aria-level="1">Outstanding Innovation in Election Cybersecurity and Technology,</li>
<li aria-level="1">Improving Accessibility for Voters with Disabilities,</li>
<li aria-level="1">Outstanding Innovations in Elections,</li>
<li aria-level="1">Best Practices in Recruiting, Retaining, and Training Poll Workers, and</li>
<li aria-level="1">Creative and Original “I Voted” Stickers.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Leading up to the 2022 elections, officials are handling issues related to election security, further utilization of cutting-edge technology, COVID-19 precautions, and increased voter engagement. The 2021 Clearie awards will once again celebrate the outstanding work of election officials meeting these challenges,” said Donald Palmer, EAC Chairman. “Twenty years ago, Congress enacted HAVA, bringing about sweeping election reforms and greater accessibility in voting. Under that Act, the EAC was entrusted to serve as a clearinghouse for election administration information by offering comprehensive products and services to state and local election offices. As the EAC celebrates the anniversary of this historic law, my fellow Commissioners and I can think of no better stage for the EAC to uphold the tremendous work of election officials.”</p>

The funds at issue come from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, which gives state and local jurisdictions various amounts of money for public safety endeavors, based on the states’ population and violent crime rate. An agency or person is designated in each state to determine how the money is spent. In her<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/page/file/1465931/download"> own letter</a> to state administering agency directors, Vanita Gupta, the Justice Department’s associate attorney general, noted that “the past year has seen an unprecedented increase in threats of violence against Americans who administer the election process in our country.” “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting every American’s right to vote, including by protecting election workers against personal threats of violence that aim to undermine the electoral process,” Gupta wrote.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7965" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-26-at-6.02.38-AM-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Threats to Democracy Part II:</strong> Officials in the Nevada County, California clerk and recorder’s office<a href="https://www.theunion.com/news/forced-their-way-through-official-describes-incident-that-led-elections-office-to-halt-in-person-services/"> closed their offices to the public for safety reasons</a> this week. “I’m deeply saddened that our office had to go to such extremes to ensure the safety of our staff,” Assistant Clerk-Recorder/Registrar of Voters Natalie Adona said. “We are taking steps toward the safe reopening of our lobby and look forward to serving walk ups soon.” The Nevada County sheriff’s office is investigating where people associated with an attempted supervisor recall effort pushed their way into the building after they were told they couldn’t enter unless they complied with the office’s mask mandate. Recall proponents<a href="https://www.sierrasun.com/news/recall-supporters-dispute-nevada-county-elections-office-claims/"> dispute the claims</a> and say they have filed a complaint with the sheriff’s office as well. The case is considered an ongoing investigation Andrew Trygg, sheriff’s office public information officer told The Union.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3368" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Montana-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Montana-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Montana-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Montana.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Voter Reg Simplified</strong>: In response to changes made to Montana election law and ahead of the 2022 midterms, a Native American advocacy group is rolling out a<a href="https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2022-01-25/new-project-aims-to-make-up-for-loss-of-same-day-voter-registration-in-montana"> new project aiming to simplify voter registration</a>. Western Native Voice is setting up kiosks in public places that will help Montanans get the voter registration process started. Montana requires a physical signature for voter registration, so once users enter their information, Western Native Voice sends them a partially completed form and a free return envelope to finish the registration. Western Native Voice is looking to reach both rural and urban Indians by deploying the kiosks to reservations and cities in places like libraries, community colleges and clinics. The organization hopes to register 1,000 new voters across the state before Election Day 2022. Ta’jin Perez with the advocacy group said the project aims to make up for the loss of same-day voter registration, which state Republican lawmakers ended last spring. The registration deadline is now the Friday before an election. “The immediate remedy is gone, which means that organizations like ours and the public are essentially saddled with the responsibility to be proactive and preemptive when it comes to voter registration,” Perez says.</p>

In New Mexico, the secretary of state’s office partnered with the University of New Mexico to release the<a href="https://www.sos.state.nm.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2020-UNM-Voter-Report.pdf"> 2020 New Mexico Election Administration, Voter Security and Election Reform Report</a>. “The data we get from these reports is essential for gauging voters’ attitudes about their voting experiences and their perceptions of election administration in New Mexico,” said Secretary Toulouse Oliver. “But this isn’t just an academic exercise. The data helps my Office and election administrators across New Mexico understand how voters are thinking, what’s working, and what needs improvement in the eyes of the customers we serve.” According to Professor Lonna Atkeson, a principal author of the report, the survey was expanded this year to include questions on perceptions of ballot privacy and incidences of voter coercion. “It’s a great example of why these comparative reports are important. We gain insight on current elections; and better understand the concerns facing voters regarding future elections. Comparing data across elections broadens the scope of our perspective on election protocol,” Atkeson said. In Virginia, Election Commission Christopher Piper this week presented the Virginia Department of Elections (ELECT)<a href="https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/Post-Election-Report_FINAL.1.24..22docx.pdf"> post-election report for 2021 November General Election</a>. The reports have been published since 2018 and this report highlights several areas of work done in 2021 to include law and regulatory changes impacting the administration of elections, participation in the election, and election administration tasks completed. It also spotlights Virginia’s successful Voter Education and Outreach Campaign and specific issues that were reported in the lead up to and on Election Day</p>

The bill, entitled the<a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/dc-washington-eleanor-holmes-norton-bill-authority-over-special-elections-dates/65-c7055d2f-0786-4be1-bb13-9307b9f15de9"> District of Columbia Special Elections Home Rule Act</a>. “The bill simply removes a limitation on the District that is not only inconsistent with the self-government authority otherwise granted by the Home Rule Act, but is also counterproductive,” Norton&#8217;s team stated via press release. “[District of Columbia Special Elections Home Rule Act] follows legislation we got enacted in 2012 that gave the D.C. Board of Elections (“Board”) more flexibility to set the date of special elections for local offices to maximize voter participation,” Norton said in a Tuesday statement. “Although we sought complete authority for the District over the scheduling of special elections, the 2012 law, the District of Columbia Special Election Reform Act, did not include this home-rule principle. D.C. should have complete authority over a matter that is unrelated to any other congressional district and has no relevance to Congress.”</p>

They also voted to change the threshold that triggers an automatic recount, from a margin of 0.1 percentage points to 0.5 points. Democrats said the election bills were a response to false conspiracies and promote false narratives about the security of elections. “Saying that the election was stolen, that’s great for a campaign speech but that’s not reality,” said Sen. Martin Quezada, a Democrat from Glendale. “And its our job as members to focus on reality.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers have introduced<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/legislature/2022/01/26/arizona-legislature-new-wave-far-reaching-election-bills-introduced/9228344002/"> a second wave of election-related bills</a> in the past week that would alter the voting system more dramatically than those heard just days ago in a legislative committee.  Newly introduced bills include<a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2R/bills/HB2596P.htm"> House Bill 2596</a>, which would let Legislature reject the results of a state election and order a new one, along with a multitude of other fundamental changes to election law. It incorporates several features demanded by election conspiracy theorists, like limiting all voting to Election Day, requiring all voting be in-person and mandating that officials count all the ballots by hand within 24 hours. It also states that the Legislature &#8220;shall call itself into session&#8221; to review the ballot-counting process &#8220;and on review shall accept or reject the election results.&#8221; House Bill 2237 would ban same day voter registration. Senate Bill 1453 would allow same-day registration. Senate Bill 1459 requires that election workers use a unique password to log into election systems, and provides for a misdemeanor charge for those who share their password with others.</p>

However, according to The Apopka Voice, councilmembers debated the hours and ultimately chose an alternative slate of ours. Instead of opening the site from 8 am-5 pm on those dates, Council voted 5-0 to increase the hours from 7 am-7 pm &#8211; the same times as the March 8th election date. The SOE estimates a cost of $21,196.16 to administer the early voting site for the six days (and 12 hours per day) leading up to the March 8th election. The previous estimate for eight-hour days was $13,200.</p>

Senate Resolution 363 won a 33-14 majority, but fell short of the two-thirds majority of 38 needed for a constitutional amendment on a party line vote, with Democrats opposing the measure and Republicans supporting it. Republicans said the change is needed to clarify the constitution to reflect state law that says only citizens of the United States and residents of Georgia can vote. Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has been campaigning in favor of the change, arguing the constitution needs more clarity. “The intention of this legislation may by to try to incite a particular base in this state to gin up support for their own elections,” said Sen Emanuel Jones, a Decatur Democrat.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers are proposing a<a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/democrats-seek-repeal-of-georgia-voting-law-including-parts-they-like/ZXZHZE6PS5ECVMDGJA5I2F5T3I/"> complete repeal of the state’s voting</a> law — even provisions that authorize ballot drop boxes and mandate a second Saturday of early voting statewide. The legislation,<a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/61215"> House Bill 941</a>, is co-sponsored by 30 Democrats in the House of Representatives. The 83-page bill would also roll back parts of the law they most strongly oppose, such as new ID requirements for absentee voting and the ability for the state to replace county election boards.</p>

Charles Meier, R-Highland aims to combat voter fraud by allowing a county clerk the ability to<a href="https://www.wmix94.com/2022/01/20/bill-would-give-county-clerks-power-to-cancel-voter-registration/"> cancel a voter registration</a> if they do not think the person is a qualified voter.<a href="https://ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocTypeID=HB&amp;DocNum=4310&amp;GAID=16&amp;SessionID=110&amp;LegID=137447"> House Bill 4310</a> seeks to address issues with the state’s mail-in vote system and would give county clerks the ability to turn down a voter registration if the clerk believes the registration is fake or if the voter has passed away or moved. Meier said his bill would give county clerks the ability to withhold any applications they get back as invalid. “The ballots will be mailed out to where they are addressed to and if you don’t live there anymore you should not be getting those ballots mailed back to you with votes,” Meier said. “A county clerk is an elected position and they are supposed to uphold the law.” The bill has been assigned to the Rules Committee but has not yet been moved.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5802" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IN-Capitol-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IN-Capitol-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IN-Capitol-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IN-Capitol.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Indiana:</strong> A Republican-backed proposal that would require Indiana<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/ct-ptb-indiana-mail-in-vote-st-0126-20220125-hevixhnlfjbzdborngoxebgltq-story.html"> voters who request mail-in ballots</a> to swear under possible penalty of perjury that they won’t be able to vote in person at any time during the 28 days before Election Day was approved by a House committee in 12-7 party line vote. Republican Rep. Tim Wesco of Osceola defended the proposal he’s sponsoring as an updating of the state’s mail-in ballot law to reflect the greater availability of early in-person voting over the past couple decades. “I believe the best policy is to encourage people to vote in person, whether on Election Day or in-person early as much as possible,” Wesco said. Indiana’s current mail-in voting limits allow people to vote by mail only if they fall into one of several categories, including being 65 or older, confined to their homes, scheduled to work throughout the 12 hours Election Day polling sites are open or being absent from their home counties on Election Day. None of those restrictions currently involve the early voting period. Lake County Election and Voter Registration Board Director Michelle Fajman said she is disappointed in the bill advancing. When considering “our day-to-day life,” different circumstances arise where someone doesn’t think they could vote in person and then their schedule changes, she said, and that the threat of a perjury charge is too strong. “I am very disappointed that (the bill) would get any traction,” Fajman said. “That’s voter suppression at its peak. They’re going to make people scared to vote absentee.”</p>
<p>The House Ways and Means Committee has voted down a bill that would have moved the deadline for counties to install a vital<a href="https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/gop-rolls-back-election-security-measure-restricts-absentee-vote-by-mail"> election security measure</a> on their voting machines. State law gives counties that use those machines until 2030 to install the paper backups. A bill this session would’ve moved that up to July 2024. But the House Ways and Means Committee deleted that change because it costs money, about $12 million. The state currently has a $4 billion surplus.</p>

The latest version of the VOTES Act put together by House Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz seeks to enshrine some of the changes made to voting rules during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to minimize health risks. New options for voters, such as voting by mail and expanded windows for in-person early voting, led to a record number of ballots being cast in the 2020 elections. The House<a href="http://www.statehousenews.com/content/docs/2022/01-26HWMVotingReform.pdf"> bill (H 4359)</a>, however, does not call for same-day voter registration, setting up a potential clash, if that doesn&#8217;t change, with the Senate where Democrats included same-day registration in the version of the VOTES Act it passed last October.</p>

Under the Mississippi Constitution, people convicted of any of 10 felonies — including perjury, arson and bigamy — lose their voting privileges for life. A 2009 opinion from the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office expanded the list of disqualifying felonies to 22. For someone to have their suffrage restored, a lawmaker has to introduce a bill on their behalf, and two-thirds of lawmakers in both legislative chambers must agree to it. A person can also seek a gubernatorial pardon. Mississippi is the only state that requires legislative action to regain the right to vote. Under Bain’s proposal, people convicted of a felony who have the crime successfully expunged from their record would automatically be allowed to register to vote. Current state law requires a person to petition a court to expunge a crime from their criminal record five years after they have completed their sentence requirements and paid all of their fines.</p>

Legislative Bill 785 would reduce the time period for mailing out early-voting ballots and returning completed ones from 35 to 22 days before statewide primary or general elections.

Senate Bill 427 mirrors changes in election laws for the 2020 election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The allowable use of absentee ballots for that election included health reasons as well as current excuses such as being out of town on election day or a disability preventing a person from going to the polls. Senate Bill 427 would also allow election officials to begin processing absentee ballots before election day for one day that would be announced prior the meeting for processing. The bill’s prime sponsor, Senate Minority Leader Donna Soucy, D-Manchester, noted the change was incredibly successful producing the largest voter turnout in state history, more than 814,000 ballots cast, and three times the normal volume of absentee ballots. The change had bipartisan support, she noted, and allowed voters to vote in a safe and efficient manner.</p>

Michelle Lujan Grisham is a little less hefty than expected. The version of the legislation introduced wouldn’t authorize a straight-party voting option, extend the mail-back deadline for absentee ballots or expand early voting by a day – all of which were components of the proposal announced earlier this month. As it stands now, the election bill would: Establish a permanent absentee voter list, allowing people to sign up once to receive absentee ballots for statewide elections, rather than having to file a new application each time; Allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local and municipal elections; Restore the voting rights of felons who aren’t incarcerated; Permitting people without an official state ID to register to vote online by using their full Social Security number; and Designating Election Day as a state holiday. The proposal is supported by Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, and its co-sponsors include the Democratic floor leaders in both chambers, Sen. Peter Wirth of Santa Fe and Rep. Javier Martínez of Albuquerque. “Even as we’ve seen attempts around the country to make voting more difficult for eligible voters,” Toulouse Oliver said, “here in New Mexico we continue to be a leader in how to balance the demands for voter access with the needs of maintaining our high levels of election security.”</p>
<p>Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has authorized legislators to take up a proposal designed to protect election workers by<a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/2464761/bill-would-prohibit-intimidation-of-election-workers.html"> making it a crime to threaten employees working for county clerks</a> or the secretary of state. The proposal, Senate Bill 144, is sponsored by Sen. Katy Duhigg, an Albuquerque Democrat and former city clerk. “Election officials at all levels, from the secretary of state down to your local polling official, have been harassed, threatened, and generally discouraged from being part of our democratic process since 2020,” Duhigg said. “It’s very important that our democracy continue to thrive, and it can only do that if we have a continued influx of professionals and citizen volunteers who come to these important jobs to conduct elections in a fair and nonpartisan manner.”</p>

It was previously approved in July 2020 and had expired at the end of last year. “We have to make sure that every eligible New Yorker can easily exercise their constitutional right to vote,” Assembly Elections Chair Latrice Walker said. “That means allowing people to vote by absentee ballot, especially during the pandemic. I’m glad we’re extending this necessary protection through the 2022 elections.”</p>
<p>State lawmakers are amending a<a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/s6226/amendment/b"> bill</a> that could<a href="https://www.gothamgazette.com/state/11045-legislators-to-introduce-new-york-city-board-of-elections-reform-bill"> change the make-up and management structure of the New York City Board of Elections</a>. ‘We&#8217;ve been working with both the State Board of Election for guidance, many election lawyers, many people familiar with the problems that the city has had forever with their elections. And I think that we&#8217;ve come up with a good model,&#8221; said the bill&#8217;s State Senate sponsor, Senator Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan). The Krueger-Rozic legislation would give the New York City Council more leverage in appointing commissioners and give city officials greater insight into budgetary matters. It would also set qualification standards for Board members, and outline some of their duties in more clear terms. The bill also replaces the current executive director with Democrat and Republican co-executive directors hired by the mayor with approval of either the City Council Speaker or Public Advocate from lists of candidates provided by the Board.</p>

Thomas West and Lisa Sobecki, would move the primary from May 3 to June 7. The measure aims to give candidates and election officials ample time to prepare for the election as mapmakers take another stab at drawing legislative and congressional districts. State officials have suggested moving the Feb. 2 filing deadline to accommodate legislative candidates and already pushed the deadline for congressional races to March 3. However, some Republicans and Democrats are hesitant to move the election itself.</p>

SURE is the program the Department of State uses to keep a complete list of all the voters registered in Pennsylvania. Aument’s bill will not allow the Department of State, PennDOT, and counties from holding any information needed to perform and full and complete audit. It will also require that the SURE system be audited every four years. “There are legitimate issues and irregularities within Pennsylvania’s election system that must be fixed so we can be confident in any election results produced by that system. Despite opponent’s claims that nothing is wrong with our elections, independent third-party audits have shown this is false, and I would be doing a disservice to my constituents if I did not act to correct these problems,” Aument said. The bill has been referred by the Senate State Government Committee for consideration.</p>

The court found that the Republican-dominated state legislature should have drawn the district lines to give minorities a majority in a second district, or at least a better chance of competing. &#8220;The appropriate remedy is a congressional redistricting plan that includes either an additional majority-Black congressional district, or an additional district in which Black voters otherwise have an opportunity to elect a representative of their choice,&#8221; the judges said in a 225-page ruling. The court postponed an upcoming candidate qualification deadline until Feb. 11 to give the legislature time to redraw the lines. The state has<a href="https://thepublicsradio.org/article/alabama-appeals-ruling-ordering-new-congressional-districts"> filed an appeal</a>.</p>

In a brief order, Fulton County Chief Superior Court Judge Christopher Brasher said a majority of local judges agreed to authorize the panel for  a year&#8217;s term beginning May 2. &#8220;The special purpose grand jury shall be authorized to investigate any and all facts and circumstances relating directly or indirectly to alleged violations of the laws of the State of Georgia, as set forth in the request of the District Attorney &#8230; &#8221; the order stated.</p>

Wilson filed court paperwork in Anne Arundel County, where the state Board of Elections is located, seeking a court&#8217;s review and possible revision of the decision. The site in question is two miles away from the Washington County Election Board&#8217;s headquarters — the primary early-voting center. The second site was added because state law requires counties with at least 50,000 registered voters, but fewer than 100,000, must have two early-voting centers. Wilson said he felt that there were other areas in the county that weren&#8217;t being served, that should have an early-voting site.</p>

And a review of evidence that is part of the three-judge panel&#8217;s opinion sheds light on a possible motive for Clerk Sherikia Lavette Hawkins to alter information related to 193 absentee ballots after the Nov. 6, 2018 election. In July 2020, Hawkins, 40, was ordered to stand trial on charges of falsifying election records, forgery of a public record, using a computer to falsify election records, using a computer to commit a crime related to forgery of a public record, misconduct in office, and using a computer to commit a crime connected to misconduct in office. But Oakland County Circuit Judge Leo Bowman last year dismissed the first four charges. Now, the Michigan Court of Appeals has reversed Bowman and increased the number of live charges back to six, up from two. The panel rejected Bowman&#8217;s finding that a district court judge erred in sending her to trial on all six counts, after hearing evidence at a preliminary hearing. &#8220;Specifically, the evidence supported the conclusion that defendant willfully falsely altered entries in the QVF (Qualified Voter File, the state&#8217;s voter database) by indicating AV (absentee voter) ballots received and accepted were either not received or not accepted because they had no signature by Election Day,&#8221; the panel said.</p>

The court threw out a 15% geographic cap on the number of signatures to get an issue on the statewide ballot. It would have placed a burden on petition circulators by forcing them to be aware of where they were gathering signatures. But the Supreme Court says it violates with the Michigan Constitution. The changes were made by the Republican-controlled Legislature in 2018 and signed by Gov. Rick Snyder before he left office.</p>

A state appellate court affirmed the decision of Superior Court Judge Thomas Daniel McCloskey to thrown out the general election results and hold a new election, rejecting an appeal filed by Democrat Jill DeCaro. McCloskey found the state Division of Elections at fault, saying their statewide voter database didn’t properly follow boundaries set in the 2011 ward redistricting map put voters from the odd numbered homes on one side of Cymbeline Drive in Ward 2, and the even numbered homes on the opposite side of Cymbeline Drive residing in the Ward 4. Appellate Court Judge Carmen Messano agreed with DeCaro that some Cymbeline Drive residents have been registered in the wrong ward for several years. Messano found that facts were insufficient to reject a special election. “The official ward map was admitted in evidence, and the judge found conclusively that the residents on that side of Cymbeline Drive are within the Fourth Ward and should have received ballots to vote in that Ward,” Messano wrote in his order.  “Nothing in the record raises a material dispute to the contrary.” Blame for the mistake rested with the Statewide Voter Registration System, McCloskey said.</p>

The district attorney assigned county detectives to investigate the case in October at the request of county Commissioner Chris Chermak. “We have thoroughly investigated the complaint filed by Commissioner Chermak and have found zero evidence of election fraud,” Powell said. “Absent additional evidence, we do not believe criminal charges against the gentleman seen dropping off ballots at the Lackawanna County Government Center are warranted at this time. There is no evidence that he fraudulently harvested votes.” Powell said the man cooperated with the investigation “and told detectives that he was simply dropping off ballots for his friends.”</p>

Bohren last week ruled ballot drop boxes could not be used in Wisconsin because state law says absentee ballots must be returned by mail or in person. He also determined voters cannot have someone else return their ballot for them. Groups that support drop boxes asked to put the ruling on hold for the Feb. 15 primary for spring elections while they pursue an appeal. They argued that approach was best because the primary election is so soon. <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/01/24/appeals-court-reinstates-absentee-ballot-drop-boxes-feb-15-vote/6636010001/">The District 4 Court of Appeals blocked the lower court ruling</a> and ruled that ballot drop boxes may be used in the Feb. 15 primary. The ruling was issued the day before election clerks were scheduled to send voters absentee ballots. This week’s decision affects only the Feb. 15 primary. The appeals court will decide later what rules will be in place for elections after that. The appeals judges wrote that they were acting in part because they did not want voters to be confused by rules that changed so close to election day. &#8220;Given this situation, the risk of confusion — and possible disenfranchisement — is compelling,&#8221; the judges wrote in their decision.

It also provides a link to five hands-on training courses &#8211; and even offers help to states wishing to enshrine the use of GIS in elections in state statute. Some states recently have been successful in supporting the use of GIS in elections and accessing funding by enacting statute. The new web page offers both model statute to use as a starting point, as well as two new helpful videos featuring insights on the process.  For states looking to invest in a new voter registration system, the page offers sample RFPs to ensure a new system is capable of integrating GIS to facilitate regular audits of precinct and voting district assignments and much more.</p>
