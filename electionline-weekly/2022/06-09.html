							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Combating insider threats     </strong><br />
<em>New guidance from CISA helps state and local officials with the latest threats</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>From a<a href="https://abc7.com/recall-election-west-hollywood-poll-worker-weho-los-angeles-county-registrar/11020929/"> problem poll worker</a> in Los Angeles County in 2020 to a rogue county clerk in<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/09/1085452644/colorado-clerk-indicted-on-13-counts-of-election-tampering-and-misconduct"> Colorado</a>, election insider threats are not new but they have also not been widespread.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5130" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png" alt="" width="300" height="124" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM-300x124.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-10.26.37-AM.png 510w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />However, earlier this month<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/01/gop-contest-elections-tapes-00035758"> a report in Politico</a> revealed that those isolated incidents of insider threats could become much more widespread in the future as political parties seek to install more of their supporters as poll workers and election workers overseeing everything from Election Day voting to ballot processing.</p>
<p>Although not in direct response to any one issue, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently released the<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/election_insider_threat_mitigation_guide_508.pdf"> Election Infrastructure Insider Threat Mitigation Guide</a> to help state and local elections officials deal with insider threats.</p>
<p>The guide defines the type of threats which include both intentional and unintentional threats and then helps elections officials build an insider threat mitigation program to combat those threats.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8460" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-09-at-12.19.32-PM-298x300.png" alt="" width="298" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-09-at-12.19.32-PM-298x300.png 298w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-09-at-12.19.32-PM-150x150.png 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-09-at-12.19.32-PM.png 716w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" />“Whether from nation state actors, cyber criminals or insider threats, election officials are in the best position to manage risks to their systems and infrastructure. CISA’s recently published Election Infrastructure Insider Threat Mitigation Guide provides election officials with the planning factors to empower them to deter, detect, and prevent harm from potential insider threats,” said former Washington Secretary of State and CISA’s Senior Election Security Lead Kim Wyman.</p>
<p>Wyman said it is important to examine the roles within election administration and understanding and limiting what harm may be incited by a malicious actor.</p>
<p>“Proper chain of custody, role-based access controls, and a commitment to transparency are key features of the election process and why voters can have confidence that their election officials could detect and prevent risks from insider threats,” Wyman said.</p>
<p>Securing elections isn’t new. Election officials have always taken steps to secure their election processes from insider threats and other risks. From handling ballots in teams of two, to robust chain-of-custody procedures, to the presence of observers during voting and counting, many long standing core election practices have been designed with insider threat mitigation in mind.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8461" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-09-at-12.19.42-PM-296x300.png" alt="" width="296" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-09-at-12.19.42-PM-296x300.png 296w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-09-at-12.19.42-PM.png 702w" sizes="(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px" />However, after 2020, the push to secure elections has taken on a renewed vigor. Recently in Colorado,<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb22-153"> legislation</a> recently signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis specifically targets insider threats. It codifies a curriculum for a certification program for county clerks as well as making it a felony to tamper with voting equipment or knowingly publish confidential information about the system. It also requires key card access and video surveillance for voting systems.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/election_insider_threat_mitigation_guide_508.pdf">Insider Threat Mitigation Guide</a> notes that election infrastructure stakeholders can implement several proactive and preventive measures to reduce the risk and impact of insider threat activity that wouldn’t necessarily rely on legislation like in Colorado. While each aspect is individually important, they are most effective when implemented together to create a comprehensive, resilient election administration environment. Key elements of election infrastructure insider threat mitigation programs include: establishing robust standard operating procedures (SOPs), managing physical and digital access control, deploying zero trust security principles, and implementing chain of custody processes</p>
<p>Wyman noted that the new guide seeks to help election officials of all resource levels to improve their insider threat mitigation practices and includes many recommendations that could be implemented at little or no-cost.</p>
<p>“While every election office is different, some of the guidance could be put into practice with nothing but a little staff-time and elbow grease – like updating your poll worker code of conduct, looking for gaps in your chain-of-custody procedures, or calling your system administrators to verify proper access controls for system users in your office,” Wyman said.</p>

							<h2>2022 Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>2022 Mini-Super Tuesday</strong><br />
<em>With 7 primaries, June 7 was about as super as it will get this year</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-8343" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="167" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px" />Tuesday June 7 was as close to a Super Tuesday as the 2022 election cycle is going to get with seven primaries— California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota.</p>
<p>While Iowa saw near-record midterm primary turnout, low turnout was the recurring theme for many of the states on Tuesday. Low turnout often means fewer issues and that certainly seemed to be the case this week with no major problems.</p>
<p>There were pockets of issues though such as confusion over redistricting, tabulation equipment malfunctioning and once again blurry barcodes.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at what happened on Tuesday:</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5084" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CAWelcome-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CAWelcome-300x201.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CAWelcome-768x514.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CAWelcome.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />California:</strong> While some blamed it on voter fatigue, whatever the reason was, turnout was quite low in The Golden State on Tuesday with it hovering just around<a href="https://kfiam640.iheart.com/featured/la-local-news/content/2022-06-08-nearly-15-of-registered-voters-in-la-county-cast-ballots/"> 15% in Los Angeles County</a>. Low turnout meant a quieter than normal primary day in the<a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/politics/2022/06/07/many-san-diegans-sit-out-the-primary-vote"> San Diego County</a> registrar of voters office. Jim Aiken, the site manager of the SDSU vote center, has been working Election Day for decades. He said he’s not seeing a lot of voters, but he is seeing a lot of people walking in and registering to vote for the first time. &#8220;It’s actually a wonderful experience for old guys like me to see someone who turned 18 the day before walk in and say, &#8216;My mom said I can come in and vote,&#8217; and we say: &#8216;She was right,'&#8221; he said. Registrar in the Sacramento area saw mixed amounts of turnout on Tuesday. While<a href="https://www.capradio.org/articles/2022/06/07/sacramento-region-likely-saw-low-turnout-in-primary-election-officials-say/"> Placer County</a> registrar Ryan Ronco said “it’s really impossible” to tell how this year might compare to 2018, he noted the county received a high number of vote-by-mail ballots despite not getting a sizable polling place turnout. “My guess is that the turnout percentages will eventually be close (either a little over or a little under) the 2018 gubernatorial primary numbers,” Ronco said via email. “The major difference will be in the way people decided to participate.” This was the first midterm election in California where very voter<a href="https://www.kget.com/news/politics/your-local-elections/vote-by-mail-dominates-primary-as-observers-question-security/"> received a ballot in the mail</a> and that appears to be the dominate way voters chose to cast their ballots. Election workers in<a href="https://www.recordnet.com/story/news/politics/government/2022/06/09/san-joaquin-countys-ballot-duplication-process-election-vote-primary/7561987001/"> San Joaquin County</a>, already reeling from the unexpected death of Registrar of Voters<a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/san-joaquin-county-registrar-of-voters-heather-ditty-dies/40208813"> Heather Ditty</a>, were forced to remake ballots  after blurry barcodes meant the ballots could not be processed.  The problem stemmed from a printing problem with the portrait layout of this year&#8217;s ballots from state-certified printer K&amp;H Printers, one of the few state-certified printers that can handle printing ballots for elections. San Joaquin County appears to be the only county in California to be experiencing the blurry barcode issue. A group of election observers in<a href="https://www.actionnewsnow.com/news/shasta-county-clerk-responds-to-allegations-of-not-following-some-election-regulations/article_115b4c42-e793-11ec-87a3-475380405439.html"> Shasta County</a> confronted Clerk-Recorder Cathy Darling Allen during the ballot counting process because the doors to the office were not sealed. Allen told Action News Now that there is no law or election guideline that says any doors must be sealed. “We’re trying our best to do what we can to engender trust and be as transparent as possible,” said Allen. “There are people who have read and consumed bad information online and they’ve just decided that they know better.” Elections officials were on the ballot in a number of counties and statewide on Tuesday. Incumbent<a href="https://autos.yahoo.com/autos/cathy-darling-allen-faces-challenge-130046305.html"> Shasta County</a> Clerk-Recorder Cathy Darling Allen  has about a  41-point lead in the race. In<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-07/nevada-county-2022-election-voter-fraud-claims"> Nevada County</a> Natalie Adona is leading the clerk-recorder race with more than 60% of the votes. In<a href="https://keyt.com/2022-primary-election-stories/2022/06/07/san-luis-obispo-county-o0p-residents-to-vote-for-a-new-clerk-recorder/"> San Luis Obispo County</a>, incumbent Elaina Cano was leading the county clerk-recorder race.

The Iowa National Guard, US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency were among those working with the secretary of state&#8217;s office to ensure the primary was secure. “Paper ballots, you can’t hack a paper ballot,&#8221; Secretary of State Paul Pate said. &#8220;The pre and post-election audits, voter ID’s at the polls and on absentee ballot requests.&#8221; There are &#8220;bi-partisan teams of poll workers [who] will be handling both the polling site and the absentee. Those are your friends and neighbors.&#8221; Additionally, Pate and his team launched a webpage to help<a href="https://www.wowt.com/2022/06/07/iowa-secretary-state-launches-webpage-debunking-election-myths/"> debunk election myths</a>. Redistricting caused confusion for some voters in<a href="https://www.kcci.com/article/iowa-redistricting-causes-some-confusion-about-polling-locations/40221268"> Polk County</a>. Polk County Auditor and Commissioner of Elections Jamie Fitzgerald said his office worked diligently in partnership with the secretary of state&#8217;s office to ensure voters were well-notified of any precinct changes months prior to Tuesday&#8217;s primary election. Despite his and his colleagues efforts, Fitzgerald said these<a href="https://www.weareiowa.com/article/news/politics/elections/iowa-primary-election-voters-face-confusion-over-redistricting-new-election-laws/524-24742da3-9900-473e-9720-e2d4806f6417"> big changes weren&#8217;t clear to all Iowa voters</a>.  &#8220;There is probably a case in Iowa where someone went to the wrong location at the wrong time,&#8221; Fitzgerald said. &#8220;We had a lot of confusion, a lot of anger at the polling sites at times where people didn&#8217;t want to declare a party. They wanted to participate in both the Democrat and Republican primaries. Under Iowa law, you have to pick one or the other. And so sometimes they picked one and they wanted to come back and pick another one. So it just doesn&#8217;t work that way unfortunately under Iowa law,&#8221; Fitzgerald said.  Unofficial results were delayed in<a href="https://www.timesrepublican.com/news/todays-news/2022/06/voting-equipment-jam-triggers-administrative-recount-results-will-still-be-available-tuesday-night/"> Marshall County</a> after some equipment jammed while tabulating ballots. In addition to redistricting,<a href="https://www.kwqc.com/2022/06/08/election-transparency-ensures-security-scott-county/"> Scott County</a> also added five early voting sites since 2010 which added some work behind the scenes. In<a href="https://www.kmaland.com/news/wellhausen-ballot-machine-issue-recount-not-expected-to-impact-all-races/article_ea529c58-e739-11ec-9419-436e775fb7c8.html"> Page County</a>, issues with voting machines had Auditor Melissa Wellhausen requesting to perform administrative recounts. Despite changes to Iowa election laws,<a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/06/08/primary-election-absentee-voting/"> turnout</a> for the 2022 reached its highest point since 1994. In the race for<a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/06/07/joel-miller-takes-democratic-ticket-for-secretary-of-state/"> secretary of state</a>, incumbent Pate (R) will face Linn County Auditor Joel Miller (D).</p>

But the secretary said the cybersecurity team detected no abnormal activity on its websites or the Statewide Election Management System (SEMS). Watson spent much of the day<a href="https://www.wdam.com/2022/06/08/secretary-state-visits-pine-belt-election-day/"> visiting polling places</a>. He noted that turnout was very low and blamed that on a variety of factors. Number one, we&#8217;re in the middle of the year, June,&#8221; Watson said. &#8220;Folks are out of town.&#8221; His office encouraged people who wouldn&#8217;t be in town to &#8220;make a plan&#8221; to vote absentee, but absentee voting has also seen low numbers. Another reason for low turnout, according to Watson:<a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2022/06/07/live-updates-ms-primary-elections-june-7-congressional/7470037001/"> voter apathy and concerns over integrity</a>. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of things going on in the country,&#8221; he told reporters. &#8220;People don&#8217;t have a lot of trust in the government. Coming on the heels of 2020, some people have a doubt whether their vote counts.&#8221;  Watson said his office has tried to encourage voting by reassuring people of election integrity in the state. One polling place in<a href="https://www.natchezdemocrat.com/2022/06/07/election-day-one-adams-county-polling-place-lost-power-but-stayed-open/"> Adams County</a> lost power, but voting was not affected. This was the first election that voters were allowed to use a<a href="https://www.wlox.com/2022/06/07/mobile-id-an-option-elections/"> mobile ID</a> as proof of voter ID. Weeks after hundreds of extension cords were reported missing at the<a href="https://www.wlbt.com/2022/06/06/hinds-co-prepared-tuesdays-primaries-weeks-after-theft-was-reported-election-commission-headquarters/"> Hinds County</a> Election Commission headquarters, officials were hopeful that Tuesday’s primaries will go off without a hitch. “Everything is ready. Everything is prepared. Poll managers are picking up bags now as we speak,” said Election Commission Chair Shirley Varnado.</p>

Experienced election judges didn’t coming back. Some counties increased their law enforcement presence at voting and counting sites. At least one has added cameras at a ballot drop-off site and is keeping its ballot counting machines at the county office, rather than distribute them to precincts. “Everybody’s, I think, a little bit on edge this year,” said Amy Reese, clerk and recorder in<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-helena-misinformation-voting-montana-6f7ae4815a34864c6fcc4c8c5a2977e6"> Lewis and Clark County</a>.

Lincoln County is hand counting all the ballots for the primary election because the ballots were cut too short and will not work in the automatic counting machines. “This is a very, very tedious, monotonous process. It takes a lot of you know, concentration and focus. And I don&#8217;t you know, I would rather take it slow and steady and be accurate 100% of the time rather than trying to push it and stretch it out until six o&#8217;clock in the morning and end up with shoddy results,” Lincoln County Elections Administrator Paula Buff said.</p>

Some counties had as few as three races on the ballot, the top slot being given to the U.S. House of Representatives. There were some early morning issues in<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-jersey-primary-election-2022/"> Gloucester County</a>, when voting machines were problematic while booting up, but election mechanics were able to resolve the issue quickly. It didn’t cause much of a delay, as there weren’t people clamoring to get in to vote.  In<a href="https://newjerseyglobe.com/campaigns/after-poll-workers-turned-her-away-82-year-old-woman-goes-to-court-to-get-her-vote-counted/"> Monmouth County</a>, 82-year-old Ann P. Ciaccio went to court after she was told she could not vote in the Republican primary because she is registered as a Libertarian.  Records show that Ciaccio registered as a member of the Libertarian Party in August 2020 while applying for identification at the Motor Vehicles Commission. Ciaccio said she had no recollection of registering as a Libertarian and never intended to affiliate with that party.  She testified that she was not seeking to perpetrate any fraud, but rather to protect her right to vote. Superior Court Judge Mara Zazzali-Hogan allowed Ciaccio to vote by provisional ballot, and finding her testimony to be credible,” ordered her provisional ballot to be counted and that her party affiliation “revert to her prior registration as a Republican.” “The right to vote would be empty indeed if it did not include the right of choice for whom to vote,” Zazzali-Hogan said. In<a href="https://www.tapinto.net/towns/paramus/sections/elections/articles/bergen-county-clerk-hogan-reports-historically-high-vote-by-mail-requests-for-primary-election"> Bergen County</a>, the presence of a county committee on the ballot required the creation of 1,276 different ballot styles because each political party and local election district has its own specific ballot. Bergen County Clerk John S. Hogan said 20 employees, from the other divisions within the office, were temporarily assigned to assist the Elections Division, along with the hiring of 9 interns.  “Our mission of getting these ballots out to the requested voter was completed on time and I applaud my staff for their fine efforts,” stated  Hogan. Hogan reported “historically high” vote-by-mail requests for the 2022 primary. Hogan stated that between 2021 and 2022 the total number of VBM ballots requested by voters for the Primary Election “has increased by a whopping 38%&#8211;from 56,500 to 78,006!”</p>

In the days and weeks leading up to the election, the secretary of state’s office put out<a href="https://www.sos.state.nm.us/2022/05/10/contingency-plans-in-place-as-fires-impact-start-of-early-voting-for-the-2022-primary-election/"> contingency plans</a> for early voting. “It’s the start of another important election season here in New Mexico but, for the many residents who have been affected by the wildfires, it’s anything but a normal one,” said Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver back in early May. “Though the situation with the fires is rapidly evolving, my Office and election administrators throughout the state have already deployed plans to help communities vote and are in the process of developing further contingencies to ensure all voter needs continue to be met.” Tuesday’s primary was the first community event in<a href="https://sourcenm.com/2022/06/08/nm-primary-election-day-the-first-community-event-in-mora-countys-fire-zone/"> Mora County</a> since the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fires forced many residents from their homes. Voter Tara Bartlett told The Source casting her ballot on Tuesday during the primary was important, not only to give her a sense of normalcy but because she wants leadership on the local level to be responsive to the post-fire recovery. Heavy winds in the afternoon forced poll workers to close their doors to maintain air quality at the polling site. Turnout for the 2022 primaries varied. In<a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/2506424/primary-voting-turnout-low-but-better-than-in-2018.html"> Bernalillo County</a>, it topped out around 23%. “It’s more than it was in 2018, but until we get up in the range of 30% and 40%, to me it’s low voter turnout,” Bernalillo County Clerk Linda Stover said. “A lot of people say ‘I’m not going to vote in the primary and will just wait until November,’ but by that time, they’ve lost their chance to pick somebody.” Alternatively, turnout in<a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2022/06/07/dona-ana-county-turnout-trending-below-2018-primaries/7546642001/"> Dona Ana County</a> was below 2018 despite the fact that this was the first primary during which minor party and unaffiliated voters could register with one of New Mexico&#8217;s three major parties and vote early or on election day. In the November<a href="https://electionresults.sos.state.nm.us/resultsSW.aspx?type=SW&amp;map=CTY"> race for secretary of state</a>, incumbent Maggie Toulouse Oliver will face Republican Audrey Trujillo and Libertarian Mayna Erika Myers.</p>

There was some concern that<a href="https://listen.sdpb.org/politics/2022-06-06/redistricting-means-some-voters-have-new-polling-places-for-tuesdays-election"> redistricting</a> may cause issues for voters, but few if any problems materialized. South Dakota Secretary of State Steve Barnett and said<a href="https://www.keloland.com/news/local-news/sd-secretary-of-state-discusses-voter-turnout/"> turnout</a> was steady statewide. Officials in<a href="https://www.keloland.com/keloland-com-original/minnehaha-election-staff-counting-absentee-votes/"> Minnehaha County</a> spent the day processing and counting about 4,200 absentee ballots.

Adams described several of these recount requests as &#8220;frivolous,&#8221; saying he will support new legislation in the 2023 session to only allow recount requests from candidates who came within 1 percentage point of the winner. Under a new law passed in 2021 — responding to a GOP candidate who sought a recanvas despite losing by 20 percentage points — the threshold margin of loss for a candidate to request a recanvas is less than 1 percentage point. No such threshold margin exists under Kentucky law for a candidate to request a recount — a more labor-intensive process that requires a judge to physically conduct a recount of ballot totals, at the petitioners&#8217; expense. Adams told <i>The Courier Journal</i> current law doesn&#8217;t prevent similar abuse in hopeless recount requests. &#8220;For the recounts, we didn&#8217;t really contemplate we would have people who lost by landslides, demanding recounts, wasting everyone&#8217;s time and abusing the process with frivolous litigation,&#8221; Adams said. Adams said he would support legislation in next year&#8217;s session of the Kentucky General Assembly to use the same 1% threshold eligibility for recounts and require candidates to go through the recanvas process first.</p>

Eisgruber said: “I am grateful to the Naming Committee for this inspiring recommendation, and I am delighted that Princeton will honor Laura Wooten for her extraordinary contributions to our nation and the democratic process. The addition of Laura Wooten’s name to the tapestry of our campus will recognize Princeton’s history, the breadth of our community, and the positive impact that one remarkable person can have through lifelong dedication to public service and civic values.” Wooten volunteered at local, primary and general election polls in New Jersey for 79 years. Last summer, Gov. Phil Murphy signed “Laura Wooten’s Law,” citing her as the longest serving poll worker in the country. The legislation focuses on middle school curriculum guidelines to ensure that students study the values and principles underlying the American system of constitutional democracy, the function of government and the role of a citizen in a democratic society.</p>

It is a great loss to San Joaquin County and she will be tremendously missed.” Ditty previously worked in Sacramento County before coming to San Joaquin County.  &#8220;Our Sacramento County Election family was devastated to hear about the passing of Heather Ditty,&#8221; the county said in a statement. &#8220;She was an important part of our office in Sacramento for many years and we were so happy and proud of her promotion into the Registrar position in San Joaquin County. She will be greatly missed as an election official, but more so, as a person.”</p>

Glenn made sure his voice was heard and his decisions were ‘his own’ and he stood by them fervently,” the USVI board of elections said in a statement.</p>

Nikema Williams (D-Georgia) has introduced a bill that would give states $20 billion over a decade to help hire poll workers, expand early voting access and take other steps to strengthen local election administration. The &#8220;<a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/06/08/rep-nikema-williams-introduces-20b-bill-boost-local-election-administration">Sustaining Our Democracy Act</a>&#8221; would create a ‘‘Democracy Advancement and Innovation Program’’ that would dole out money for elections offices to &#8220;promote innovation to improve efficiency and smooth functioning in the administration of elections for Federal office&#8221; like upgrading voting equipment, boosting cybersecurity capabilities and increasing access to the ballot. The bill&#8217;s lead co-sponsors include Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux (D-Lawrenceville) and Reps. Colin Allred (D-Tx.), GeorgiaTerri Sewell (D-Al.), and Marc Veasey (D-Tx.). The legislation also explicitly prevents money from being used for &#8220;activities that intimidate, threaten, or coerce voters, poll workers, or election administrators&#8221; and specifically mentioning provisions that appeared in Georgia&#8217;s<a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2021/03/27/what-does-georgias-new-voting-law-sb-202-do"> 98-page SB 202</a> and other laws, like bans on giving out food or water to voters in line or sections that could remove local elections officials.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Alex Mooney (R-West Virginia) has introduced a bill that would<a href="https://www.theintermountain.com/news/local-news/2022/06/warner-mooney-join-against-biden-voter-registration-order/"> override Executive Order 14019</a>, issued last year by the Biden administration with the goal of promoting access to voting. The executive order requires the heads of federal agencies to develop strategic plans for how each agency will help increase voter registration and participation. The plans are to be submitted to the White House for review. According to the executive order, voter registration plans should include ways to provide information on how to register to vote, request absentee ballots, and how to vote in upcoming elections; ways to streamline access to state and local online voter registration systems, including using the federal vote.gov website; distributing vote-by-mail forms and voter registration applications; and working with third-party organizations to provide various voter registration services at federal agencies. “The federal government has no business forcing itself into the West Virginia’s voter registration process,” Mooney said in a statement. “I am proud to introduce this bill in Congress to return sole authority on this issue to the states, where it belongs.”</p>

Doug Ducey<a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-arizona-climate-and-environment-doug-ducey-voter-registration-494412e915c51ee27f9653f3a6533a45"> signed several elections-related bills into law</a> including a bill authorizing county election officials to count mail ballots on-site, but no counties will be required to allow it.  Anyone wanting to put their mail ballot into a tabulator and watch it be counted will have to show identification as if they were voting in person.  Those who prefer to skip the line, drop off their ballot and leave can continue to do so. Those ballots will continue to be counted at election offices after officials have verified that the signature on the envelope matches the signatures on file. Meanwhile, Ducey also signed a bill that seeks to get the U.S. Election Assistance Commission to modify the federal voter registration form so that it requires Arizona’s documentary proof of citizenship. Arizona is required to accept the federal registration form, but anyone who does not provide proof of citizenship is only allowed to vote for president, U.S. Senate and House.  The Republican governor also signed a bill making it a felony to knowingly help someone vote in Arizona if they’re registered in another state, such as by forwarding a mail ballot.</p>

Jared Polis has<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/06/02/colorado-election-laws-doxxing-insider-threats/"> signed two pieces of election legislation</a> into law.<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb22-153"> SB22-153</a>, which requires new security measures for election systems, and<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1273"> HB22-1273</a>, which makes it a crime to threaten election officials or publish their personal information online to harass them. “We want to make sure that every vote is accurately counted,” Polis said at the signing ceremony. “And we also want to make sure that those that oversee elections themselves don’t have to worry about their about their physical safety.” The election security law is specifically aimed at “insider threats,” such as election workers “embracing conspiracies,” Secretary of State Jena Griswold said. It includes making it a felony to tamper with voting equipment or knowingly publish confidential information about the system. It also requires key card access and video surveillance for voting systems. The law also requires training for election workers, a move specifically hailed by the Colorado County Clerks Association as bolstering voter confidence in how elections are conducted. The group, which is comprised of Democrat and Republican clerks, backed both bills.</p>

Delaware currently cuts off voter registration for an election four Saturdays prior to Election Day, but<a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail/68679"> House Bill 25</a> would give voters an opportunity at the polls with specific forms of identification. HB25 spells out acceptable IDs as a valid government photo ID, or a document displaying the name and address of the person wishing to vote, including a utility bill, bank statement, government check, or paycheck, all of which must be issued within 60 days of the registration date. &#8220;Currently, we have an arbitrary deadline several weeks before an election to register to vote which disenfranchises potential voters. Upon missing this deadline, they are unable to cast ballots, even if they meet all other eligibility requirements,” said Rep. Sherry Dorsey Walker (D-Wilmington) “This is an outdated and unfair practice. Election Day registration has existed in several states for decades and is proven to safely and effectively increase voter turnout. It is time for Delaware to be a leader in our nation, join other states, take this important step toward removing voting barriers and finally enfranchising our constituents.&#8221;</p>

The bill would also increase ballot access for voters with disabilities and service members overseas; make sure eligible voters who are incarcerated are able to request a mail ballot and vote; and takes steps to modernize the state’s election administration process, according to lawmakers. The legislation — a compromise version of separate bills approved earlier by House and Senate lawmakers — now goes back to both chambers for debate. The Senate could take up the measure as early as Thursday. The final bill does not include any provisions that would allow individuals to both register and vote on Election Day, despite efforts by the Senate to offer multiple compromise approaches</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3545" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NYS-Captial-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NYS-Captial-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NYS-Captial-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NYS-Captial.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />New York</strong>: The Legislature has approved the<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-voting-rights-new-york-8a1420c49a7260e8d88f977431300df6"> John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of New York</a>. Senate Bill S1046E would make it easier to sue over discriminatory voting policies and require localities with a history of civil right violations to get approval before changing election rules. Under the bill, certain areas, school boards, or local election boards would no longer be able to make changes — like removing people from voter rolls, reducing voting hours or the cutting number of polling sites — without approval from the state attorney general’s office or courts. The legislation would make lawsuits over voter intimidation and suppression easier by laying out an expedited process for New Yorkers or the attorney general to sue over voting violations, including new bans on voter intimidation, deception and obstruction. A spokesperson for Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said she will review the legislation. This year, Hochul has called for this type of state-level Voting Rights Act to protect voters of different races and languages.</p>
<p>A bill proposing to<a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2022/06/new-york-legislature-wont-move-local-elections-to-even-numbered-years.html"> move local elections to even-numbered years</a> did not move forward in the Legislature this year. The bill had  aimed to change local elections for county executives, county legislators and town supervisors to even-numbered years to coincide with state and national elections. NYS Assemblymember Amy Paulin, D-Scarsdale and Sen. James Skoufis, D-Cornwall, both sponsored the bill, saying it would increase voter participation and decrease confusion. “It’s accurate we’d have more people voting if we put local elections in even years, but many people, Republicans and Democrats, say it doesn’t give the same depth &#8230; and people are going to be deprived of that debate of what’s happening locally,” Paulin told Spectrum. “We’re going to wait. I’m advocating for hearings so we can really wrap our arms around it.”</p>

Doug Mastriano, R-Franklin County, won passage by a nearly 30-19 party-line vote. It now goes to the GOP-controlled House for consideration. A spokeswoman for Gov. Tom Wolf said he is strongly opposed to the measure. The bill also increases the number of poll watchers a candidate can have at a precinct from two to three, which Mastriano said adds another layer of observation and transparency to ensure election laws are being followed. In addition, it permits poll watchers to be inside the space as ballots are being counted but they cannot interfere with that process. The bill also would require poll watchers to have clear line of sight within six feet as mail-in and absentee ballots are being prepped to be counted, and would increase penalties on election officials who impede or intimidate a poll watcher performing their duty.</p>
<p>A House panel advanced a bill barring county officials from soliciting or accepting<a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/senate-bill-barring-third-party-election-funding-advances-in-house/"> non-government funding for elections</a>. The Republican-authored Senate bill now appears poised for a repeat in the House of a debate this spring when state election officials and Democratic legislators urged lawmakers to ensure money is available to help counties fund elections. The House State Government Committee reported out Sen. Lisa Baker’s, R-Luzerne, legislation with a 14-10 vote along party lines on Tuesday.</p>

I thank the bill sponsors, legislators, and advocates who saw to it that this bill got across the finish line.”? The legislation (2022-H 7100A, 2022-S 2007A) makes mail voting easier by allowing online mail ballot applications, and permitting any voter to use a mail ballot or an emergency mail ballot without needing an excuse for why they can’t visit their polling location on Election Day. It also drops the requirement that mail ballots be either signed by two witnesses or notarized. Instead, voters’ signatures will be verified using their registration records using a four-tiered verification process. The bill requires every municipality to maintain at least one drop box where voters can deposit their ballots securely through the close of polls on Election Day. Additionally, the act allows nursing home residents to opt in to automatically receive applications for mail ballots for every subsequent election.</p>

The group filed a lawsuit on behalf of Greater Birmingham Ministries to seek lists of purged voters, as well as Alabamians denied the right to vote due to felony convictions under the National Voter Registration Act. The lawsuit asks the court to declare that Merrill is in violation of the NVRA and to order him to provide those records without cost to the small Birmingham-based nonprofit. The CLC says the state is required to provide electronic copies of registration records that accurately reflect the current official lists of eligible voters free of cost. Greater Birmingham Ministries, which assists with voters registration and restoration of rights, says it needs the lists to better inform those who can legally vote but may be unaware of their rights to do so.</p>

In<a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22056368/complaint-1.pdf"> a complaint</a> filed in state Superior Court in Anchorage, plaintiff Robert Corbisier, executive director of the Alaska State Commission for Human Rights, alleges that the ballots that were mailed to every registered voter in the state for the special primary election “do not provide an opportunity to visually impaired voters to vote privately, secretly and independently.” The lawsuit names Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer — who oversees elections in Alaska — and Division of Elections director Gail Fenumiai as defendants. Meyer’s office declined to comment on the lawsuit. The Division of Elections deferred comment to the Department of Law. The commission is asking for the certification of election results to be delayed until “visually impaired Alaska voters are given full and fair opportunity” to vote. On Wednesday, Anchorage Superior Court Judge Una Gandbhir granted a motion for expedited consideration of the request.</p>

Jantzen boiled down the essence of the case in his four-page ruling to this: &#8220;Is the Arizona Legislature prohibited by the Arizona Constitution from enacting voting laws that include no-excuse mail-in voting? The answer is no.&#8221; He noted that the no-excuses mail-in voting that lawmakers approved in 1991 provides protections for secrecy. For example, the ballot return envelopes are designed in a way to ensure the voter&#8217;s choices are not visible. In addition, the envelopes are &#8220;tamper evident&#8221; so election workers can notice if someone has tried to open the ballot envelope. Jantzen denied the Republican Party&#8217;s case as well as its request for a preliminary injunction that would have blocked almost all early voting for the Nov. 8 general election. That would have required millions of Arizona voters to obtain their ballot at the polls and cast it there. The lawsuit did not seek any change for the upcoming Aug. 2 primary election. Ballots were already printed for that election and early voting begins July 6.</p>
<p>In a new legal filing, an attorney for Secretary of State Katie Hobbs is asking a judge to<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1785069/attorney-az-secretary-state-asks-judge-toss-lawsuit-over-election-procedures-manual"> toss out a lawsuit over the Elections Procedures Manual</a>.  Attorney General Mark Brnovich sued the secretary of state, demanding changes to the manual that tells local elected officials what they can and cannot due during elections.  Attorney Roopali Desai says Hobbs has complied with the state law while drafting the manual, but Brnovich waited more than four months to sue after his deadline to approve the changes.  Desai claims there is nothing in the statute that gives the attorney general final say on specific provisions in the manual and that would give Brnovich unilateral power.  Furthermore, she said if the changes he wants are implemented, it would cost Maricopa County alone $420,000 to reprint ballot envelopes.  The judge set a June 10 hearing.</p>
<p>A gubernatorial candidate and a state lawmaker want the courts to stop Arizona from using<a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2022/06/09/arizona-gubernatorial-candidate-lawmaker-file-motion-stop-use-electronic-voting-machines/"> electronic voting machines</a> for the upcoming midterm elections. Kari Lake and Rep. Mark Finchem, both Republicans, announced they’re seeking a preliminary injunction for the state not to use “unsecure black box electronic voting machines” in November. The injunction is in connection to a lawsuit that was filed in April calling on a jury trial, so using an electronic voting system to count ballots would be unconstitutional. The pair claim the machines are not “reliably secure” and don’t meet the “constitutional and statutory mandates to guarantee a free and fair election.” Finchem said in a statement the machines are untrustworthy since companies refuse to make their systems and software open to the public and, therefore, violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Lake and Finchem claim the machines have “glaring cybersecurity vulnerabilities,” including allowing for possible remote access, unmonitored network communications and containing secret content. However, a report found on the Arizona Senate’s partisan review of the 2020 election found zero evidence that voting tabulation machines were connected to the internet or the information was compromised. It also found no major problems in the election in Maricopa County.</p>

In responding to a motion from Peters’ and Knisley’s attorneys asking Barrett to review the case to see if there were reasonable grounds to investigate and indict, the judge revealed numerous aspects of that investigation, something that is somewhat unprecedented because grand jury probes are highly secret. In it, Barrett wrote that, over the course of five days, the grand jury heard testimony from numerous witnesses and saw about 60 exhibits. “The acts and/or omissions of Knisley and Peters, as public officials, constituted the crimes of violation of a duty, failure to comply with the requirements of the Secretary of State; and also for Peters, first-degree misconduct,” Barrett concluded in his review. “The record supports a finding of probable cause for these allegations.”</p>
<p>Four agencies have filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Colorado Springs seeking to force<a href="https://www.csindy.com/news/local/lawsuit-seeks-to-move-cos-city-elections-from-april-to-november/article_4a048cdc-e362-11ec-9449-fb9127a6595e.html"> changing the city&#8217;s elections from April to November</a>. Citizens Project, Colorado Latinos Vote, the League of Women Voters of the Pikes Peak Region and the Black/Latino Leadership Coalition filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Denver on June 1. The group is represented by the Election Law Clinic at Harvard Law School. The lawsuit argues that Colorado Springs is &#8220;nearly alone&#8221; among Colorado cities and towns to hold its city election in April of odd-numbered years, noting that only three of the state&#8217;s 25 most populous cities and towns do so — Colorado Springs, Fort Collins and Grand Junction. &#8220;The timing of Colorado Springs’ elections for City Council and Mayor massively disadvantages Hispanic and Black residents,&#8221; the lawsuit notes. &#8220;Only about 16% of the City’s non-white registered voters participate in these April off-year elections. In contrast, the turnout rate for white registered voters is around 32%. This racial disparity dwarfs those often seen in Voting Rights Act cases.&#8221;</p>

The Florida Supreme Court rejected the request to<a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/politics/latest-florida-redistricting-battle-ends-in-defeat-for-voting-rights-advocates/"> draw different congressional maps</a> than those approved in the previous court effort, meaning the maps offered up by Gov. Ron DeSantis will be the ones used during the 2022 elections. The injunction requested in a Florida district court, to stay the map supported by DeSantis and use a different one drawn by a Harvard professor, was denied. Additionally, the Black Voters Matter request that a judge provide a “constitutional writ” was also denied. The Florida Supreme Court’s decision to preserve the previous map was based on what they said was a lack of jurisdiction. “Here Petitioners ask this Court to intervene in the First District Court of Appeal’s ongoing consideration of an appeal of an order imposing a temporary injunction,” the court wrote. “At this time, this Court does not have jurisdiction over that matter.” Additionally, the court said that they did not know whether the First District’s decision would “provide an appropriate basis for this Court’s exercise of discretionary review—meaning that we cannot say that it is likely that there is any jurisdiction to protect.”</p>

Rejecting arguments made during a September<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/11th-circuit-hears-civil-rights-groups-bid-for-bilingual-voting-materials-in-a-georgia-county/"> hearing</a>, the panel found that the Gwinnett County Board of Elections had no duty to provide Spanish speakers in the state’s second-most populous county with Spanish translations of voting materials before the 2020 presidential primary election. The panel ruled that Georgia is not a “covered jurisdiction” under Section 203(b) of the Voting Rights Act. While Section 203(c) of the law requires Gwinnett County officials to provide bilingual voting materials, it does not require the county to translate materials supplied by the state. In a 50-page opinion, a three-judge panel of the appeals court disagreed with a Georgia federal judge’s<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/latino-officials-gwinnett-county-order-usdc-georgia.pdf"> finding</a> that the organizations lacked legal standing but nonetheless upheld the October 2020 decision dismissing the case on the merits. “203(c) only applies to Gwinnett County when it ‘provides’ voting materials, i.e., when it furnishes or supplies the materials. Nothing in the statute requires Gwinnett County to translate voting materials provided by another entity,” U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa, wrote on behalf of the panel. “While § 203(c) requires Gwinnett County to provide its voting materials in both English and Spanish, it does not require Gwinnett County to translate voting materials provided by [Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger],” the ruling states. “And plaintiffs failed to plead facts to support its conclusory allegations that the Gwinnett County Board of Elections provides English-only voting materials, specifically absentee ballot applications, on its website.”</p>
<p>Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger testified last week before a Fulton County<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/06/03/raffensperger-testifies-before-grand-jury-in-trump-2020-election-probe/"> special grand jury</a> charged with investigating whether former President Donald Trump and his allies attempted to illegally coerce officials to declare him the winner of the 2020 election. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis initiated the investigation following the public release of a recorded January 2021 phone call between Raffensperger and state election officials in which Trump urged the state elections chief to find enough votes to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 election in Georgia. Raffensperger’s testimony began in the morning and wrapped up after 2 p.m. But while he briefly spoke to the media at the start of the day, he avoided the large media contingent waiting outside when he left the courthouse.  The special grand jury rules prohibit prosecutors and jurors from publicly discussing the proceedings, although witnesses can choose to speak if they want, said former longtime Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter. Porter said it appears that the secretary of state doesn’t want to come across as a witness who is just willingly volunteering to appear in court, even behind closed doors. The day prior to the testimony, Raffensperger spoke to media outlets about how he continued to follow the law despite the overtures from Trump and others.</p>

Dick has ruled that the Louisiana legislature<a href="https://www.wafb.com/2022/06/06/judge-orders-louisiana-redraw-congressional-map-include-additional-majority-minority-district/"> must redraw</a> its recently approved Congressional District maps to include another majority-minority district. Like the map used for the last decade, the new map included five of six U.S. Congressional districts that leaned heavily Republican even though roughly a third of Louisiana’s population is Black. Both the old and new maps have only one majority-minority district and it includes parts of New Orleans and Baton Rouge.</p>

The lawsuit, filed by attorney Stefanie Lambert on behalf of Sheriff Dar Leaf, alleges these parties have<a href="https://www.wilx.com/2022/06/05/barry-county-sheriff-suing-attorney-general-secretary-state-michigan-state-police-others-over-election-fraud-investigation/"> interfered with Leaf’s investigation</a> into claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Leaf challenged the validity of the election results, an accusation that was shut down quickly by a federal judge for lack of evidence. That ruling read, “Applications invite the Court to make speculative leaps towards a hazy and nebulous inference that there has been numerous instances of election fraud and that Defendants are destroying the evidence. There is simply nothing of record to infer as much, much less conclude that irreparable injury will occur before the defendants can be heard.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5403" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NV-Flag-300x222.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="222" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NV-Flag-300x222.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NV-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Nevada:</strong> In a last-chance appeal before the Nevada Supreme Court, opponents of a proposed ballot question calling for adopting<a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/nv-supreme-court-to-decide-fate-of-ranked-choice-voting-open-primary-ballot-initiative"> open primaries and ranked-choice voting</a> in Nevada elections argued the initiative is too broad and should not be allowed to proceed to the ballot. Though the initiative backers say they have gathered enough signatures to qualify the petition for the November ballot, justices on Nevada’s highest court could essentially strike the measure down if they side with Nathan Helton, a Democratic Party-aligned Churchill County voter who filed the lawsuit opposing the initiative.  If approved by a majority of voters in 2022 and 2024, the initiative would allow voters to participate in primary elections regardless of party affiliation, and in the general election, voters would be able to rank the top five candidates from the primary by order of preference. Proponents say those changes would empower Nevada’s growing share of nonpartisan voters, who make up nearly a third of the state’s registered voters and are currently unable to vote for partisan offices in primary elections. Attorneys representing Helton and Nevada Voters First, the group backing the so-called “Better Voting Nevada” initiative, made their final pitches to the court in oral arguments before the justices — just 21 days before the signature submittal deadline.</p>

Jubelirer ordered counties to keep the undated ballots separate from other ballots and to count them separately. The ballots in question are roughly 880 mail-in ballots that lack a handwritten date on the envelope. State law requires a voter to write a date next to their signature on the outside of their mail-in ballot return envelopes. A handwritten date on a ballot envelope plays no role in determining whether a voter is eligible or whether a ballot is cast on time. GOP Senate Candidate David McCormick sued the state to count the ballots after the 3rd Circuit ruled in a 2021 case that undated ballots should be counted. In an emergency appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the counting of the 2021 ballots. The Supreme Court’s action — called an administrative stay — freezes the matter until the court can give the case further consideration.</p>

The panel ruled that Paul Goldman, an attorney and longtime Democratic Party activist, lacked standing to pursue the lawsuit he filed last June. Goldman had argued that House members elected for two-year terms in November 2021 must run again in 2022 under newly redrawn maps that properly align legislative districts with population shifts. The 2021 elections should have been the first held under constitutionally required redistricting based on the 2020 census. But because census results were delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the state held elections under the old legislative boundaries; new maps weren’t finalized until December. Goldman argued that deprived Virginians of their constitutional voting rights, violating the “one man, one vote” principle outlined by the U.S. Supreme Court. The judges ruled Goldman did not have standing as a voter or a potential candidate and granted Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares&#8217; motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Following that ruling, Jeff Thomas, a Virginia author has<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-author-files-new-lawsuit-seeking-2022-house-elections/"> filed a new federal lawsuit</a> seeking a new election.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/facts-time-fiction-reporting-truth-amid-lies-and-disinformation">Facts in a Time of Fiction</a>: Journalists have long been charged with sorting fact from fiction through their reporting. But what happens when readers redefine what they see as truth and what they’ll accept as fact?  New York Times writer and author Elizabeth Williamson is among journalists confronting the rampant rise and spread of conspiracy theories through her reporting and research. Her current work has focused around unraveling the targeted misinformation and lies spread after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Conn., the surviving families’ lawsuits against Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and the election disinformation fueling the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack.  In this instructional program with the National Press Club Journalism Institute, Williamson will share her reporting and research process, along with insights she gained as she connected the dots on how conspiracy theories grow. Williamson, whose critically-acclaimed book “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/624175/sandy-hook-by-elizabeth-williamson/">Sandy Hook: An American Tragedy and the Battle for Truth</a>” published this spring, will describe how she threaded together more than 400 interviews, 10,000 pages of court testimony and other records, and on-the-ground reporting to trace a line from conspiracy theories around Sandy Hook to Jan. 6, 2021. Participants will learn to: Identify how misinformation and political conspiracy theories have spread; Work with sensitivity and clarity while reporting on conspiracy theories;  Pre-bunk conspiracy theories through early reporting; Use trauma-informed reporting methods while working with people suffering tragedy; and Organize reporting and deep research to craft a long-form narrative. <strong>Where</strong>: Online. <strong>When:</strong> June 10, 11:30am Eastern.</p>
<p><a href="https://hopin.com/events/tufts-circle/registration">CIRCLE Growing Voters</a>: How do we develop the next generation of voters and expand the electorate?
