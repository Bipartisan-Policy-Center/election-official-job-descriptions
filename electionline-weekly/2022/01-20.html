							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Prioritizing Achievable Federal Election Reform</strong><br />
<em>New collaborative report from BPC provides a framework for bipartisan reform</em></p>
<p>As expected, this week Senate Democrats<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/19/us/biden-voting-rights-filibuster"> failed to move voting rights legislation</a> to the floor for a vote or change the filibuster rules.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, the vote to end debate on the bill failed, 51-49, with every Republican voting against moving the bill to the Senate floor for a final vote. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) changed his vote to &#8220;nay&#8221; at the end so he can bring the legislation up again at a later date. Later, a separate vote to change the filibuster rules for the voting rights bill so it could pass with a simple majority of 51 votes also failed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7060" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />In a statement after the failed vote to change the filibuster, President Joe Biden (D) said: &#8220;I am profoundly disappointed that the United States Senate has failed to stand up for our democracy. I am disappointed — but I am not deterred.”</p>
<p>So what’s next? Is it possible to pass any federal election legislation? This week the Bipartisan Policy Center in collaboration with AEI, R Street, Unite America and Issue One have released a report on a framework for bipartisan election reform:<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/achievable-election-reform/"> Prioritizing Achievable Federal Election Reform</a>.</p>
<p>Stark partisan dividing lines in Congress currently distract from potential areas of common ground in fostering an election system that puts voters first by being fair, accessible, secure, and transparent. These crucial topics include voter registration, voter identification, options to vote before Election Day, clean and accurate voter rolls, and audits.</p>
<p>This<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/achievable-election-reform/"> report</a> outlines a realistic framework for bipartisan election legislation. If implemented, this framework would massively improve election administration and Americans’ voting experience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7944" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Summary-Framework-for-Bipartisan-Federal-Election-Reform.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="791" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Summary-Framework-for-Bipartisan-Federal-Election-Reform.jpg 612w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Summary-Framework-for-Bipartisan-Federal-Election-Reform-232x300.jpg 232w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" />Federal election legislation, while rare, has a long track record of being bipartisan. For as much attention as members of Congress and the public have paid to how Americans vote, the most recent comprehensive elections bill passed in October 2002. But the urgent need for shoring election infrastructure becomes more obvious with each election.</p>
<p>This report authored by a working group of five nonprofit think tanks elevates the election and voting reforms that have gotten lost in the highly partisan federal debate about elections. The working group comprises individuals from five nonprofit think tanks from across the political spectrum:<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/"> Bipartisan Policy Center</a>,<a href="https://www.aei.org/"> American Enterprise Institute</a>,<a href="https://issueone.org/"> Issue One</a>,<a href="https://www.rstreet.org/"> R Street Institute</a>, and<a href="https://www.uniteamerica.org/"> Unite America</a>.</p>
<p>The data used in this report is sourced from<a href="https://votingrightslab.org/"> Voting Rights Lab</a>. We came together to publish this report to ensure that important concepts—such as accessible voter registration and accurate voter rolls—are understood to be nonpartisan proposals that will improve elections and not benefit one party more than another.</p>
<p>Many of the policy suggestions outlined in this report draw on recommendations made by<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/elections-task-force/"> BPC’s Task Force on Elections</a>, which includes 29 state and local election officials from 20 states devoted to making meaningful improvements to U.S. elections. The report references the task force’s recommendations made in<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/logical-election-policy/"> Logical Election Policy</a>,<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/voting-experience-2020/"> Improving the Voting Experience After 2020</a>, and<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/bipartisan-principles-for-election-audits/?utm_source=bpc+bpc&amp;utm_medium=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Bipartisan+Principles+for+Audits"> Bipartisan Principles for Election Audits</a>.</p>
<p>The proposals in this report also align with several findings from commissions focused on U.S. democracy, including the<a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2005/09/carter-baker-election-commission/"> Carter-Baker Commission</a>, a 2005 bipartisan group that produced<a href="https://www.legislationline.org/download/id/1472/file/3b50795b2d0374cbef5c29766256.pdf"> 87 recommendations</a> on federal election reform that was revisited in 2021 through a series of webinars. The recommendations also track the<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/pcea"> Presidential Commission on Election Administration</a>, a task force led by Bob Bauer and Ben Ginsberg that produced<a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/Amer-Voting-Exper-final-draft-01-09-14-508.pdf"> a report with recommendations</a> for state legislative action in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>BPC will be hosting a<a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1dRKZlkamgXJB"> Twitter Space</a> today, January 20 at 3 p.m. Eastern with Insider’s Grace Panetta to discuss the report and a path forward for reform.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, EAC Commissioners are pleased to announce two new award categories honoring innovative programming developed by election official associations and successful Help America Vote Act (HAVA) grant initiatives. 2022 marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of HAVA, and the Commissioners hope to highlight the spirit of this landmark bipartisan legislation by recognizing innovative uses of HAVA funds. The prestigious new award will also help jurisdictions utilize these best practices to enhance future efforts.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EAC will present awards in the categories of:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outstanding Use of HAVA Grants in Elections Modernization,  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outstanding Election Official Association Program, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outstanding Innovation in Election Cybersecurity and Technology, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving Accessibility for Voters with Disabilities,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outstanding Innovations in Elections, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Practices in Recruiting, Retaining, and Training Poll Workers, and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative and Original “I Voted” Stickers.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Leading up to the 2022 elections, officials are handling issues related to election security, further utilization of cutting-edge technology, COVID-19 precautions, and increased voter engagement. The 2021 Clearie awards will once again celebrate the outstanding work of election officials meeting these challenges,” said Donald Palmer, EAC Chairman. “Twenty years ago, Congress enacted HAVA, bringing about sweeping election reforms and greater accessibility in voting. Under that Act, the EAC was entrusted to serve as a clearinghouse for election administration information by offering comprehensive products and services to state and local election offices. As the EAC celebrates the anniversary of this historic law, my fellow Commissioners and I can think of no better stage for the EAC to uphold the tremendous work of election officials.” </span></p>

Sara Bruckman, the village clerk in Fox Point and the president of the Wisconsin Municipal Clerks Association, said she was writing new information to include with absentee ballots so voters know they will be allowed to return them only by mail or in person. Those ballots are to go out on Jan. 25. She noted the rules could change again between then and the Feb. 15 primary as<a href="https://www.weau.com/2022/01/19/how-ballot-drop-box-ruling-could-impact-eau-claires-next-election/"> judges consider an appeal</a>. &#8220;It takes away the public&#8217;s ability to trust us because we are constantly changing what we&#8217;re told to do and then we have to tell them that we&#8217;re changing what we&#8217;re told to do,” she said. &#8220;So it just inserts more distrust into the process that does not need to be there.&#8221; In some towns, the drop boxes outside of the local government office are used for more than just ballots so it’s impossible to seal them. Brookfield&#8217;s interim clerk, Renee Tadych She said she still needed to figure out what to do if voters placed ballots in the drop box. If voters use the drop box in the days before an election, there would not be time to return them to the voters so they could re-submit them, she said.  “My question is, then what? What do we do? How do we get a hold of the voter? Do we mail the ballot out? You know, I don&#8217;t know those answers,” she told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have to scramble, mostly on education, because voters are going to think they can use a drop box,&#8221; said Scott McDonell, Dane County Clerk. &#8220;It&#8217;s really frustrating because it makes no sense at all.&#8221;  While an appeal to the ruling is expected, for now it means voters can only turn in their absentee ballot by mail or in person to their local clerk. Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall-Vogg said it<a href="https://www.cbs58.com/news/local-clerks-scramble-to-educate-voters-after-judge-bans-absentee-ballot-drop-boxes"> really puts voters and drop boxes in limbo</a> for upcoming elections. &#8220;Wisconsin has a history of getting these judicial decisions right before elections that creates confusion,&#8221; said Woodall-Vogg.</p>

Last week, elections officials throughout the state began reporting a<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/13/texas-voting-mail-rejections/"> high rate of rejections of mail ballot applications</a>. The cause of the rejections is two-fold. The new law requires that those applying for mail ballots must provide a driver’s license number or the last four numbers of their social security. In some instances, what the voter puts on the application, is not what county officials have on file. The problem initially came to light when the Travis County elections office announced that 27% of their applications were being rejected. The secretary of state’s office issued a statement urging that Travis County—and others—review the applications to make sure they are being rejected for the correct reasons. County officials said there hasn’t been a final rejection of any applications, only that they need “additional guidance” from the Secretary of State’s office. County officials held a press conference this week to discuss what outgoing county clerk Dana DeBeauvoir said is a<a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/local/travis-county/texas-secretary-of-state-travis-county-at-impasse-on-dealing-with-mail-in-ballot-application-rejections/"> “complicated issue.”</a> “Before we actually take action on those rejections, we have what looks like might be down to a 27% rejection rate,” DeBeauvoir said at the presser. “That is still extremely high. It is not unusual for primaries to have a higher [rate] than in comparison with other elections, a higher rate of rejection. But that’s really high.” Another contributing factor to the high rejection rate is simply outdated forms. In some cases, voters are using old forms that don’t require that information. “I’m sure there are many thousands of<a href="https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2022/01/18/dallas-tarrant-denton-counties-texas-law-mail-ballot-applications-rejected/"> old forms out across the state</a> (libraries, post offices, political offices, etc),” wrote Denton County Elections Administrator Frank Phillips in response to questions. As of Tuesday, his office has rejected 210 out of the 483 applications it’s received, a rate of 43%. Outdated paperwork is also at the heard of another SB1-related issue. KUT in Austin reported that the secretary of state’s office is<a href="https://www.kut.org/politics/2022-01-18/texas-says-supply-chain-issues-have-limited-the-number-of-voter-registration-forms-it-can-give-out"> limiting the number of voter registration forms</a> it can provide to third-party organizations like the League of Women Voters because the forms had to be reprinted to accommodate new penalties and the state is having an issue getting enough paper to print the forms. Sam Taylor, assistant secretary of state for communications did point out that using an old form would not be fatal to a registration. Additionally, the state finally offers<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/online-voter-registration-texas-numbers-million-16731315.php"> online voter registration</a>, which as of the end of 2021, more than 1.5 million people had taken advantage of.<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

Secretary of State Michael Adams says the state’s absentee ballot law has provisions for them. “It has always allowed for people to vote who are not in their home county on Election Day. Our law also provides that if you live temporarily in one location but your home is in another location, and you have a specific intent to return to your home, not necessarily that that address but to that county, you have the ability to vote in your home county.” Adams cites as an example, someone who lives in Hopkins County but is now in Jefferson County temporarily. “I actually have the option. I can change my registration to Jefferson County and vote there, or I can continue to vote in Hopkins County by absentee ballot.” If a polling place was in one of the buildings destroyed by the tornadoes, Adams says local board of elections can ask the State Board of Elections to do a number of things. That includes moving to a different location, consolidate voting locations, using a countywide vote center. “It’s generally granted, but they must petition the state board.” Another option for local boards in the storm-ravaged areas can take, is movable voting locations during the time in-person absentee voting is available before election day, something Adams says Hopkins County did in the past. “They were basically RVs that traveled around the county. The locations were advertised in advance in the paper and on the radio, so people would know where to go vote. Adams says one thing people in the tornado areas don’t have to worry about is the loss of their voter registration information. “Fortunately, we do have a statewide voter registration system, and we have servers in Frankfort with all the information. We don’t expect any negative impact with respect to our voter registration from that.”</p>

Lewandowski spearheaded Urbandale High School’s successful voter registration drives in 2019 and 2020. She helped the school register more than 90 percent of eligible students in both the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years, qualifying for the Carrie Chapman Catt Award twice. “No school in the state registered more students to vote than Urbandale High School the past two years, and Monica’s efforts were a key reason for that success,” Pate said. “She is dedicated to encouraging and helping young people register to vote and get involved in the elections process here in Iowa.” The award was established in 2021 to honor the accomplishments of late civil rights leader and longtime Congressman John Lewis. The goal of the award is to recognize a gifted, civic-minded young person each year in every state. Lewandowski is the first Iowan to receive this honor.</span></p>

He was 69. There are two elections commissioners in Westchester, one representing the Republicans and the other representing the Democrats. LaFayette was the Democrat commissioner. In addition, for about 15 years until 2020, LaFayette served as chairman of the Westchester Democratic Party. He most recently was chairman of the Mount Vernon Democratic City Committee. Westchester County Executive George Latimer issued a statement saying, in part, “The entire County of Westchester mourns the death of Reginald A. LaFayette. Reggie had a long and distinguished career as a public servant. He was politically brilliant, and it is without doubt that no person did more to bring diversity to city and county government than Reggie. “He was insightful and tempered; he was my friend for nearly 50 years starting when we were both young men in Mt. Vernon – where we both first became active in the community. We shared meals, advice and even coached a little league team together.” LaFayette’s Republican counterpart at the Board of Elections, Douglas Colety, said, “It was my honor to work with Commissioner LaFayette, not only as a fellow election commissioner, but also as a fellow party leader. Many of our fellow election commissioners around the state would marvel at the close working relationship – and yes the close friendship – that Reggie and I shared over the past 13 years. “Commissioner Reggie LaFayette will be remembered as a true gentleman in an often rough-and-tumble business,” Colety said. “In an era of intense partisanship, Reggie had close friends in all political parties who mourn this loss today. His legacy is undeniable. For those of us who knew Reggie best and worked with him everyday, your political stripe did not matter – we all valued his wise counsel, years of experience and devotion to his work ensuring free and fair elections for all of Westchester.”</span></p>

The measure passed in a 220-203 party-line vote. The manner in which the legislation was approved allows Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-New York) to bring it straight to the floor. But Democrats would need 60 votes — including 10 GOP votes — to get it to President Biden&#8217;s desk given the filibuster. The legislation would establish federal standards for voting access, including allowing for same-day voter registration, establishing Election Day as a legal public holiday, requiring states to allow a minimum number of days for early voting and allowing people to vote absentee by mail for any reason. The package also includes provisions of a bill named after the late civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Georgia) that would restore a provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required states with histories of voting rights violations to obtain clearance from the Justice Department before implementing new election laws. That provision was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013 in the Shelby County v. Holder decision. Democrats are using a bicameral bill related to allowing NASA to lease its properties to other entities as the legislative vehicle for the voting rights package.  That process will give Senate Democrats a procedural shortcut so that they can bypass the 60 votes typically needed to formally start debate on legislation. But the bill will still have to clear a 60-vote hurdle to actually pass. On Wednesday night, the vote to end debate on the bill failed, 51-49, with every Republican voting against moving the bill to the Senate floor for a final vote.  Schumer changed his vote to &#8220;nay&#8221; at the end so he can bring the legislation up again at a later date. Later, a separate vote to change the filibuster rules for the voting rights bill so it could pass with a simple majority of 51 votes also failed.</span></p>

Stevenson said her bill is intended to prevent bad actors from getting and misusing voters’ personal information.

Currently, unaffiliated voters have until Election Day to make that change, and only affiliated party members are subject to the March 11 deadline if they decide to switch parties. Sen. Mary Souza, R-Coeur d’Alene, is co-sponsoring the bill with Rep. Caroline Nilsson Troy, R-Genesee. Under current Idaho law, members of a political party must switch affiliations by the end of the candidate filing period before a primary election, or they can’t do it for that election, but unaffiliated voters can switch right up to Election Day. In Idaho’s closed Republican primary, only affiliated party members may cast ballots. Idaho’s Democratic primary election is open. Souza and Troy’s new bill includes an emergency clause, which would make it apply in this year’s primary election. The new bill’s fiscal note says, “There is minimal to no cost associated with this effort, and it will save poll worker time on Election Day by not having to record any change of affiliation at the polls.”</span></p>

LR3CA had the support of Secretary of State Bob Evnen, who campaigned on enacting a voter ID law, and other conservative lawmakers in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, who said it would bring Nebraska in line with 35 other states that have similar provisions in their law. But opponents labeled it as a solution in search of a problem, saying there was no evidence of voter impersonation in Nebraska. They also said requiring voters to obtain a photo ID card would create additional barriers for Nebraskans who are low income, older, non-white or live with disabilities before they could exercise a constitutional right to vote. The committee took no action on LR3CA last year after its Feb. 17, 2021, hearing.</p>

Gov. Roy Cooper has expressed concern with the bill and may veto it. And with Democrats already voting against the measure en masse, he&#8217;d likely be able to sustain that veto, rendering the planned changes moot. But for now House Bill 605 lays out this proposed schedule for the primaries: Candidate filing would run from March 24 to April 1. The primaries would be June 7. If Cooper vetoes the bill, and if the veto is sustained, the primaries would go back to May 17. The idea behind the delay is to leave more time for an ongoing court fight over North Carolina&#8217;s congressional, state House and state Senate election districts.</p>

Mike Winder, R-West Valley City, and sponsored in the Senate by Curt Bramble, R-Provo, is entitled “<a href="https://www.standard.net/news/local/2022/jan/19/proposed-bill-could-make-ranked-choice-voting-the-standard-in-utah/">Ranked Choice Voting Amendments</a>.” This bill would require ranked-choice voting to be used in multi-candidate primary and general election races statewide. Along with multiple cities in Salt Lake County, the Utah County cities of Elk Ridge, Genola, Lehi, Springville, Vineyard, and Woodland Hills utilized ranked-choice voting during the 2021 election. While the bill has only been introduced thus far, if enacted, it would be a significant change for much of the state’s voters. It would eliminate the Municipal Alternate Voting Methods Pilot Project, which the Utah County cities are operating under. The bill also defines the various thresholds that would need to be met for a recount, depending on the number of total votes in a race. Under the proposed legislation, ranked choice voting would be used for both general and primary elections.</p>

The panel voted down bills that sought to require voters to present photo ID at the polls, require local registrars to verify Social Security numbers and other information before registering applicants as voters, and do away with same-day voter registration, which allows a voter to both register and cast a ballot on Election Day. Democrats expanded access to voting in 2020, when they enjoyed control of the House, Senate and Executive Mansion for the first time in a generation. Republicans have been hoping to repeal some of those measures since taking control of the Executive Mansion and House of Delegates in November’s elections. Dozens of similar Republican-sponsored bills have been filed in the House. Among them are multiple measures to require a photo ID to vote and limiting in-person absentee voting to no more than two weeks before an election. Current law allows 45 days.</span></p>

Alaska will become the second state to use ranked-choice voting, which asks voters to pick multiple candidates in order of preference. Alaska will use it in state and federal general elections but not in municipal races or the statewide primary. Gail Fenumiai, director of the Alaska Division of Elections, said the division has been preparing to implement the new system since it became law, and this week’s order doesn’t change anything. In<a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21182436/220119-alaska-supreme-court-order-on-bm2.pdf"> their order</a>, the Supreme Court’s five justices say only that they are upholding<a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/07/29/judge-says-alaskas-new-ranked-choice-voting-system-is-legal/"> lower-court rulings</a> in favor of the new system, which was approved by voters in a 2020 ballot measure. The justices said they will issue a longer written explanation for their decision at a later date. In addition to ranked-choice voting in the November general election, the new ballot measure creates an open August primary election. All candidates for a particular office will be placed on a single ballot. Voters pick one candidate, and the top four vote-getters advance. The measure’s third component, requiring additional disclosure for certain third-party campaign contributions, is already in effect. The court’s order came one day after justices<a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/01/18/alaska-supreme-court-weighs-arguments-over-new-election-process/"> heard oral arguments</a> in an Anchorage courtroom.</p>

The lawsuit claims that Barry Haas’ free-speech rights were disregarded when he was denied an appointed position for the September 2021 special Little Rock tax election due to his political and ideological views. The lawsuit alleges that he was denied the appointment after a meeting where Chairwoman Stahr claimed he was refusing in-person and on social media to follow Arkansas photo I.S. requirement as an elected official. “I previously challenged Arkansas’s voter-identification laws requiring photo I.D. in court, because I believed the laws were unconstitutional and bad policy,” Haas said. The case was filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</span></p>

The 21st Judicial District Attorney&#8217;s Office made the announcement last week. In the announcement Thursday morning, Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said the grand jury investigation will be &#8220;thorough and guided by the facts and the law.&#8221; Their statement did not name anybody in particular. In a brief news conference, Peters said she would not renege on her unsubstantiated election claims and said the grand jury would find she had not committed any crimes.</span></p>

Peters is under a federal and state investigation for a security breach of the county’s election equipment last year during an annual upgrade to its voting machines. Last year, a Mesa county district court judge banned Peters from having any role in administering the 2021 election, but that order will soon expire. Griswold had asked Peters to sign an agreement allowing significant state supervision in order for her to manage the upcoming midterm election. It would have required Peters to submit all of her written communication related to elections to the state, as well as providing logs of everyone who entered secured areas in the elections division. Peters would also only have been allowed near the voting machines with supervision, among other stipulations. Peters declared there was no way she&#8217;d sign the order or agree to any of Griswold’s  terms. Griswold is requesting the court name Mesa&#8217;s current director of elections, Brandi Bantz, to take on the clerk&#8217;s election duties. “I am taking action to ensure that Mesa County voters have the elections they deserve,” Griswold said in a written statement announcing the lawsuit. “I will continue to provide the support and oversight needed to ensure the integrity of Colorado’s elections.”</span></p>

The justices overruled the lower court by granting an emergency request by the governor’s lawyers to stop it for now. The machines in question were about to be wheeled in and a special meeting of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and Elections had just gotten underway at 1 p.m. Friday when a lawyer for the county, Tom Breth, announced that the Supreme Court’s filing office had just notified him the stay was granted. “Stay tuned.

The</span><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/teigen-wec-complaint.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> underlying lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contested guidance memos from the Wisconsin Elections Commission, or WEC, in March and August of 2020 allowing third parties to return someone else’s absentee ballot and absentee ballots to be returned to unstaffed drop boxes in a voter’s municipality instead of being mailed or returned in person to a municipal clerk. Concluding a three-and-a-half-hour proceeding, Bohren said Wisconsin election laws are very specific and felt both the disputed practices, which he said were “major policy decisions that alter how our absentee ballot process operates,” were contrary to the law. Bohren compared them to in-person voting on Election Day and said statutes are unambiguous that an elector must be personally involved in casting their ballot, regardless of informal rules issued to clerks by the WEC. In an order from the bench, he granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs, entered an injunction giving the WEC two weeks to issue a memo withdrawing its promotion of both absentee voting options and said such future guidance must go through statutory rulemaking procedures.</span></p>
<p>A Democrat running for U.S. Senate filed a <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/19/senate-candidate-files-lawsuits-wisconsin-over-ballots-and-voting-machines/6576455001/">pair of lawsuits</a> alleging Wisconsin election officials aren&#8217;t keeping ballots secret in some cases and are not properly vetting voting machines. In one case, Peter Peckarsky asked a Milwaukee County judge to order the state Elections Commission to bar Milwaukee and other cities from marking absentee ballots with numbers that could reveal how individual voters cast their ballots. Peckarsky is seeking to invalidate the law requiring election officials to write poll list numbers on absentee ballots. That would ensure no one&#8217;s votes are publicly disclosed, he argued in one of his lawsuits. In the other case, Peckarsky is seeking to force the commission to more thoroughly scrutinize voting machine software.The lawsuit argues the commission is not following a state law that requires the commission to keep copies of voting machine software. The lawsuit says the state keeps the software with an escrow company instead of retaining it itself.</p>
<p>Immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera Action filed a legal challenge to Assembly Republicans&#8217; <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2022/01/19/milwaukee-immigrant-rights-group-voces-de-la-frontera-action-sues-over-gop-election-review-subpoena/6576856001/">review of the 2020 election</a> after disclosing it had received a subpoena. The Milwaukee-based group is seeking to intervene in a lawsuit Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul brought in October to try to knock down subpoenas that were issued to the state Elections Commission. &#8220;Gableman&#8217;s subpoena is modern-day McCarthyite political theater designed to perpetuate lies about the 2020 election and silence and intimidate voters of color from exercising their right to free speech and their right to vote,&#8221; said a statement from the group&#8217;s executive director, Christine Neumann-Ortiz.</p>
