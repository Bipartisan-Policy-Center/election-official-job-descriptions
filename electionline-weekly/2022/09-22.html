							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Midterm Monitor</strong><br />
<em>New online tool helps track election topics and trends on social media</em></p>
<p>By Maya Kornberg and Rachael Dean Wilson</p>
<p>Two nonprofit organizations have developed the<a href="https://midtermmonitor.org/"> Midterm Monitor</a>, a free tool that can help election officials track narratives on social media about the midterms, both the messages’ content and their popularity. The Midterm Monitor has been collect­ing data since early summer and has already captured close to 40,000 posts related to voting and elec­tions.</p>
<p><strong>What Is the Midterm Monitor?<br />
</strong>The <a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/hamilton-dashboard">Alli­ance for Secur­ing Demo­cracy</a> at the <a href="https://www.gmfus.org/">German Marshall Fund of the United States</a> and the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/defend-our-elections">Bren­nan Center for Justice at NYU Law</a> created the <a href="https://midtermmonitor.org/">Midterm Monitor</a> for public use, designed to surface and sort election administration narratives that can <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8862" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MidtermMonitor-300x99.png" alt="" width="300" height="99" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MidtermMonitor-300x99.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MidtermMonitor.png 522w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />impact election officials. The monitor captures election-related posts and associated metrics from select accounts on Face­book, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.</p>
<p>The tool can help election officials see if narratives and information related to voting and elections that they are seeing have moved from the fringe into more mainstream conversations on social media. It also lets users select which platforms they want to focus on. Research shows that different demographic groups (by age, ethnicity, and gender) use different social media platforms, and initial data from the Midterm Monitor already indicates variation in the trending topics from platform to platform.</p>
<p><strong>How the Midterm Monitor Works<br />
</strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8681" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BrennanCenter.png" alt="" width="184" height="128" />The Midterm Monitor collects social media posts and their metrics from candidates for office, national and local media, and other key accounts. It gathers data from accounts affil­i­ated with candid­ates for the U.S. House, the Senate, governor, and secret­ary of state. In addition, it captures data from the accounts of influ­en­tial, national, English-language media outlets and pundits; the most-followed English-language local media outlets in 10 battle­ground states; non-English language media outlets in the U.S., including Span­ish media; and state media and diplo­mats asso­ci­ated with the Chinese, Iranian, and Russian govern­ments.</p>
<p>Election officials can use the monitor to focus on posts containing elec­tion-related search terms like “ballots” or “vote by mail.” The tool also lets users parse posts and metrics according to state, source, and other characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Guidance Available to Election Officials<br />
</strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8863" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/allianceforsecuringdemocracy-300x156.png" alt="" width="300" height="156" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/allianceforsecuringdemocracy-300x156.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/allianceforsecuringdemocracy.png 464w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In the coming weeks, researchers from the Alliance for Securing Democracy and the Brennan Center will publish detailed analyses of data from the tool, identifying key topics in posts and exploring how narratives vary across different languages, states, races for office, platforms, and type of account. Researchers have looked at — and expect to continue to explore — several topics including the Spanish-language information space, election denialism, threats to democracy, voting and election administration, and more.</p>
<p>Experts from the Alliance for Securing Democracy and the Brennan Center are on hand to help election officials with the tool. We hope that the monitor provides information and support to election officials as they navigate the online conversations about voting and elections at this critical time.</p>

There has been a recent increase in the spread of false claims regarding elections in our state, despite there being no evidence of intrusions into Iowa’s election systems. Secretary Pate and the county auditors also stand united in their support of the bipartisan teams of poll workers that will work at voting sites this November.  “Iowans vote on paper ballots, and you cannot hack a paper ballot. We have numerous security measures and checks and balances in place to ensure the integrity of the vote. That includes Voter ID, public testing of voting equipment prior to the election, post-election audits and wide array of cybersecurity protections,” Secretary Pate and the Auditors Advisory Group said in a joint statement. Secretary Pate’s office developed an<a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/electionsecurityiniowa.html"> Election Security in Iowa</a> webpage to counter misinformation and disinformation. It includes a Myth vs. Fact section, a <a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/pdf/ElectionSecurityinIowa.pdf">detailed breakdown </a>of the many security measures Iowa has put in place to protect elections, and a <a href="https://vimeo.com/280607200">five-minute video </a>that details how ballots and election equipment are maintained. “You also have your friends and neighbors staffing the polling sites-in a bipartisan fashion. They are standing up and providing a great service for our state and nation and deserve respect. We encourage all eligible Iowans to register to vote and participate in elections, and we want voters to know that we are dedicated to protecting their vote,” Secretary Pate and the Auditors Advisory Group added.</p>

All active registered voters will still receive a mail-in ballot for the general election but at the polls, according to Kampf, those casting their votes in person this fall will now fill out paper ballots instead of using a touch screen, although one voting machine will be available at every voting site for people with disabilities and &#8220;special needs.&#8221; Voters will also have to provide two signatures — one on a card and another on a &#8220;signature screen.&#8221; Election workers will count the votes utilizing what Kampf called a &#8220;parallel tabulation&#8221; process with voting machines alongside the hand count. For the hand count, Kampf said, teams of five will tally batches of 50 ballots at a time. Each team will consist of a &#8220;reader&#8221; who will announce the votes on each ballot, a &#8220;verifier&#8221; responsible for making sure the ballots are read aloud correctly, and three &#8220;talliers&#8221; who will record the votes.  Once all 50 ballots have been tallied, the &#8220;reader&#8221; and the &#8220;verifier&#8221; will sign off on the batch after double-checking that the votes recorded by the three &#8220;talliers&#8221; match. If there are any errors, the team will recount any race with a discrepancy, repeating the process until the votes match. Kampf said he expects to release preliminary results around 10 p.m. on the night of the election, and estimates the hand-count to be completed between Nov. 10 and Nov. 14.  To meet those deadlines, Kampf said his office would need to count 40 batches a day. &#8220;In a worst case scenario,&#8221; he told commissioners, &#8220;I would have to have a minimum of eight teams doing five batches a day per team.&#8221;</p>

In Lafayette Parish, Louisiana though a fight over teaching voting rights has now dragged on for more than a year. In 2021 library director Teresa Elberson received a<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/05/louisiana-library-voting-rights-books/"> small grant to host a program about voting rights</a>. However, the Library Board of Control rejected the money citing “far left” content. This week, the Lafayette Parish Council voted unanimously to allow the library system to again apply for a Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities grant supporting a &#8220;Who Gets to Vote?&#8221; series. But some council members and Library Board of Control President Robert Judge suggested that, when it comes to discussing modern voting rights issues such as felons being able to vote, there&#8217;s more than one side. The discussions, they said, should be neutral. Judge said Library Director Danny Gillane worked with board member David Pitre to line up moderators for the discussion if the grant is approved &#8220;to present this in a way that I think is the desire of the board.&#8221; Parish Council Chairman A.B. Rubin disagreed with how modern voting rights should be discussed. &#8220;We can&#8217;t have that. We need to educate everybody,&#8221; Rubin said. &#8220;We have modern-day voter suppression going on. It&#8217;s important that we have this grant and hopefully it will be done the proper way.&#8221; It remains to be seen if the library will even receive the grant.</p>

And while state and local elections officials and voting advocates celebrated in a variety of ways, the Montgomery County, Ohio board of elections celebrated in a very special way. The BOE hosted a<a href="https://www.whio.com/news/local/area-board-elections-holds-naturalization-ceremony-dozens-citizens/R6DKCQGWYJGU7JDYX43CXVLOM4/"> naturalization ceremony</a> for 88 people from 43 different countries. “We’ve got 88 new voters right here in our backyard,” Sarah Greathouse, deputy director at Montgomery County Board of Elections said. The nationalization ceremony and National Registration Day were combined to make sure the new citizens can sign up to vote ahead of November’s election.  “The greatest benefit of citizenship, and the biggest responsibility of that status is the right to vote,” Judge Walter Rice said.</p>

The two bills, sponsored by state Rep. Ann Bollin, R-Brighton, have already been passed by the House and are now one vote away from the governor after approval from the Senate Elections Committee.<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(gbdgbwyinhgv20ghp03vgvr5))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=2022-HB-6124"> House Bill 6124</a> would require the Secretary of State establish comprehensive training for poll challengers, defining their “powers, rights and duties” on Election Day. Poll challengers are people sent by political parties and interest groups to precincts to lodge complaints if they see something wrong. HB 6124 does not specify exact rules for challengers but proposes county clerks, political parties and challenging organizations get comprehensive training. There would also be a registry to see which organizations have been trained. The Senate Elections Committee also approved<a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(gbdgbwyinhgv20ghp03vgvr5))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=2022-HB-6071"> HB 6071</a> to the full Senate on Tuesday, which would expand the types of places that can be polling locations. Both bills have support from municipal clerks, the ACLU and the Michigan League of Conservation Voters. The Department of State took a neutral stance.</p>

The motion was introduced by board Chairman Sami Khoury and supported by Commissioner Steve Vaughan. It was passed with a 5-2 vote with Commissioners Todd Talaski and Joe Murphy voting against the motion. “After all the people I have talked to in the last couple of weeks, I think it would be a good idea,” said Vaughan when the discussion was opened to the board. “When we do pass stuff like this, it seems we are starting things that may never be looked back at again,&#8221; Talaski said. &#8220;I don’t disagree with keeping them, they already are, but I don’t think it needs to be made into a motion.&#8221;</p>

The “Election Workers, Voters and Polling Places Protection Act” will prohibit and impose penalties for threats and harms such as intimidation of poll watchers and election officials involving violence or threats of harm; and physical damage to or threats to physically damage a polling place, tabulation center, or other election infrastructure. It aims to make the workers who help administer New York elections safer, from officials to volunteers and the contractors who set up and maintain voting equipment. Election workers from across the country recently testified before Congress about threats, intimidation and the spread of misinformation during the 2020 election. “The relentless harassment and intimidation across the country from authoritarian forces in the wake of the defeat of Donald J. Trump makes this type of legislation necessary in order to ensure the safety of election workers and guarantee fair election results,” Lavine said.</p>

Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon, would establish an updated process to clear the state’s voter rolls of deceased electors and those who move away. According to the bill, the Department of State would be required to cross-reference its database of registered voters at least once monthly with death record information from local registrars – birth date, first and last names and last four digits of a Social Security number. Deceased electors are to immediately be removed from Pennsylvania’s Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors, however, except within 90 days of an election. The bill looks to establish the procedure to remove those who move out of state, along with a one-time exception allowing those who move out of state to cast a ballot in Pennsylvania when they are not yet registered to vote in their new place of residence. It would also require organizations or individuals circulating absentee or mail-in ballot applications to use updated voter registration data from the Department of State. The second proposal,<a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/BillInfo.cfm?syear=2021&amp;sind=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=2484"> House Bill 2484</a>, introduced by state Rep. Lori Mizgorski, R-Allegheny, would mandate that write-in candidates file statements of financial interests within 30 days of having been nominated or elected. There would be an exception for those who decline nomination or office. The proposed rule would apply to state and local elections.</p>

Smartmatic alleges in the complaint that both Lindell and MyPillow defamed the voting tech company by falsely promoting the theory that its machines had been hacked or rigged. Smartmatic also alleges that Lindell, who has advertised promo codes for MyPillow products to viewers and listeners during TV and radio segments where he pushed the false narrative that voting technology was rigged in the 2020 election, used deceptive trade practices. Lindell moved to dismiss Smartmatic’s complaint, arguing that the company failed to adequately plea the defamation claim, and that the deceptive trade practices claim fails because Lindell was acting in a personal, not professional, capacity when making statements about the 2020 election. MyPillow separately moved to dismiss Smartmatic’s complaint, arguing that it is shielded by the First Amendment and that it did not make any statements about Smartmatic. The company also argued that Lindell’s statements can’t be imputed to MyPillow. Wright denied both Lindell’s and MyPillow’s motions to dismiss the complaint. The court concluded that Smartmatic has alleged sufficient facts to support its defamation claim, including its claims that Lindell’s statements were false, that his defamatory statements were communicated to outside parties, that he knew or should have known his statements were false and that he acted with actual malice in promoting them. The court concluded that MyPillow can be vicariously liable for Lindell’s actions, since the CEO intentionally promoted MyPillow while allegedly defaming Smartmatic in the media and during public appearances. The court also maintained that Smartmatic can pursue its claim that Lindell violated the Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practice law, since the company has alleged sufficient evidence to its claim that Lindell’s statements were made in part to promote MyPillow.</p>

Cook granted a motion by the Department of Elections and Election Commissioner Anthony Albence to stay his ruling pending an expedited appeal to the state Supreme Court, which is scheduled to hear arguments in the case on Oct. 5. Cook said his stay would allow elections officials to process mail-in voting applications and prepare ballots, but that they are not allowed to send the ballots to voters. The judge said elections officials have indicated that if the Supreme Court upholds his ruling, they will notify voters who have applied for mail-in ballots under the new law that they will need to vote in person on Nov. 8.</p>

Ron DeSantis’ administration and national GOP groups tried to<a href="https://wusfnews.wusf.usf.edu/politics-issues/2022-09-17/appeals-court-questions-ruling-against-parts-florida-election-law"> convince an appeals court to overturn a federal judge’s ruling</a> that parts of a 2021 Florida elections law were intended to discriminate against Black voters. The state, the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee took the case to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker ruled that parts of the law were intended to discriminate against Black Floridians, a key voting bloc for Democrats. Walker’s March 31 ruling chronicled what he described as the state’s “grotesque history of racial discrimination,” saying that “when all of the evidence is viewed together, a coherent picture emerges.” The Tallahassee-based district judge blocked parts of the law. But the appeals court in May issued a stay of Walker’s ruling amid the continuing legal battle. The stay kept the law in effect for this year’s elections.</p>

In the race, incumbent Brian Painter defeated challenger David Fischer by just over 100 votes. But following the primary election, Fischer’s campaign filed suit, charging that Painter had personally engaged in<a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/painter-remains-gop-nominee-as-ky-supreme-court-wont-hear-campbell-co-commissioner-election-case"> illegal electioneering</a> when Painter distributed campaign materials at an event for poll workers when early voting had already started. A Jefferson Co. judge agreed, vacating Painter’s win, tossing him from the ballot, and replacing him with Fischer. Painter’s campaign appealed and the Kentucky Court of Appeals overturned the lower court’s ruling. The state Supreme Court denied Fischer’s campaign’s motion for a review of the case, ending the legal battle and officially setting the November match-up as one between Painter, who is seeking his fourth four-year term and Democratic nominee Melissa Whalen.</p>

Dan Cox, the Republican candidate for governor, has<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-cox-mail-ballots-filing-20220915-ztothq4jzzeb5ipsanqlsupvw4-story.html"> filed a motion</a> to block a move to allow mail-in ballots to be counted before Election Day. Under current Maryland law, mail-in ballots cannot be canvassed until two days after Election Day. The Maryland State Board of Elections has said that without the ability to begin the process of canvassing mail-in ballots before Election Day, certifying the results of the November general election could take until December or even early January. “There is no emergency. There are no more excuses for not following the law,” Cox said in a news release. “The Board of Elections asking the courts to change the rules of election weeks prior to the election being held is unacceptable,” Cox said. Cox, in opposing the board’s petition for emergency relief, is claiming only the General Assembly can change the law. The General Assembly did in fact change the law earlier this year, but that legislation was vetoed by current Governor Larry Hogan. Montgomery County Administrative Judge James Bonifant<a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/09/20/montgomery-judge-weighing-board-of-elections-request-to-speed-up-mail-in-ballot-processing-in-november/"> heard testimony</a> from both sides this week and said he will provide a ruling by Friday.</p>

Four tribes, two Native American advocacy groups and three political youth action organizations sued the state over election laws passed in 2021 that eliminate same-day voter registration and restrict acceptable forms of voter ID. The plaintiffs argue these policies unduly burden the right to vote, especially for marginalized communities and young people. The laws were temporarily blocked last spring by Yellowstone County District Court Judge Michael Moses while the full legal case over the laws plays out. The Montana Supreme Court initially overruled Moses and allowed the laws to stand, saying the plaintiffs waited too long to request the block. The laws were enforced during the June primary. On Wednesday, the majority of justices on the state Supreme Court reversed course and put the block back in place. The court said its order is not a final ruling, but a safeguard in the event the laws are deemed unconstitutional. Attorneys argued over the merits of the case during a two week long trial in August. Judge Moses is expected to issue a final ruling soon.</p>
<p>Judge Rienne McElyea ruled that the state cannot enforce three laws on college campuses passed during the 2021 legislative session. The laws ban transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports; prohibit groups from<a href="https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2022-09-19/new-laws-over-trans-athletes-voter-registration-on-campus-cant-be-enforced-judge-rules"> registering voters in dorms or dining halls</a>; and craft new guidelines for harassment and free speech policies on college campuses. McElyea ruled that all three bills infringe upon the Board of Regents’ constitutional authority to govern the state’s university system. The ruling invalidates the voter registration legislation and prevents the other two bills from impacting the university system. Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office says it is reviewing the ruling.</p>

The lawsuit specifically asks a judge to force the county to release “the partisan breakdown and political affiliation” of the county’s poll workers. Lawyers for the RNC claim the county has declined to provide that level of data, citing privacy concerns, even offering to “treat this information as ‘attorneys’ eyes only.&#8217;” In its lawsuit, the RNC claims all registered poll workers should not be of the same party. Nevada law requires political parties to be equally represented among poll workers. There is no evidence that poll workers are of all the same party in Clark County. Clark County Registrar Joe Gloria, who is personally named in the lawsuit, has repeatedly said poll observers, not poll workers, from both parties have had reasonable access as provided by law. A judge tossed a lawsuit from Republicans regarding poll watchers following the 2020 election. According to the lawsuit, the RNC is asking the county for poll worker data regarding the 2022 primary and upcoming general election. The request was filed in August and later denied. The RNC claims the information is a public record and does not include other identifiable information.</p>

The court ruled that current Secretary of State Frank LaRose improperly failed to accept nine signatures – eight from Cuyahoga County and one from Columbiana County – that Maras gathered after a July 5 deadline that LaRose had ordered administratively, but before a July 15 date that appears in Ohio law. The court ordered LaRose to accept the signatures, which pushes Maras above the 5,000-signature threshold independent candidates must gather from Ohio voters to qualify for the ballot. Republican Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor joined the court’s three Democrats in issuing the ruling, while Republican justices Pat DeWine and Pat Fischer dissented.</p>

The complaint, filed in Common Pleas Court, was submitted on behalf of four registered voters from the county, assisted by two attorneys from a prominent conservative law firm in Villanova and an organization led by former Trump administration officials, the America First Legal Foundation. The suit asks that the court issue an injunction prohibiting the Chester County Office of Voter Services from providing two drop-boxes, out of the 13 that the county maintained in the past election, that are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, unless they are monitored at all times by a staff person from the county Office of Voter Services. The case has been assigned to Common Pleas Court Judge William P. Mahon. A hearing has tentatively been scheduled for Oct. 3.</p>

The suit asks that all future elections be conducted with paper ballots only and seeks the seizure of the county’s voting machines and all materials relating to elections from November 2020 forward.  It was filed by Marble Falls resident Patricia Cope, who could not be reached for comment. An appeal is pending in the Third Court of Appeals. The lawsuit named Election Administrator Doug Ferguson, Burnet County Commissioners Jim Luther, Damon Beierle, Billy Wall, and Joe Don Dockery, and County Judge James Oakley as defendants. Cause No. 54047 uses the exact language as a series of similar lawsuits filed in other Texas counties, including Lubbock, Jefferson, and Hood. The suits were filed in August to beat the Sept. 3 deadline for destroying election materials in the November 2020 presidential election, a timeframe set by law. State law mandates a 22-month holding period for election materials in all elections. Ferguson said he would keep the information stored and safe as the lawsuit makes it way through the courts.</p>

Krabach filed a lawsuit this month alleging that King County Elections Director Julie Wise<a href="https://www.axios.com/local/seattle/2022/09/16/king-county-ballot-surveillance-counter-lawsuit"> trampled Krabach’s free speech rights</a> by calling Krabach’s signs a form of voter intimidation and ordering them removed. The lawsuit also targets Gov. Jay Inslee and Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, who similarly criticized the signs. Krabach&#8217;s signs, which appeared near multiple ballot drop boxes in King County in the lead-up to the Aug. 2 primary, said: &#8220;This Ballot Dropbox is Under Surveillance – Accepting compensation for harvesting or depositing ballots may be a violation of federal law.&#8221; Krabach is challenging Washington&#8217;s law that says no one can interfere with or try to influence someone&#8217;s vote within 25 feet of a ballot drop box.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5168" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-300x205.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag-768x524.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WI-Flag.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Wisconsin:</strong> The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty is challenging the use of a federal voter registration form in Wisconsin, saying it doesn’t meet the requirements laid out by state law. The firm filed a lawsuit asking a judge to declare the<a href="https://www.wsaw.com/2022/09/15/wisconsin-lawsuit-challenges-federal-voter-registration-form/"> National Mail Voter Registration Application</a> illegal in the state and order the Wisconsin Election Commission to withdraw its approval for the form because it doesn’t ask for all information required by state law. The lawsuit, filed in Waukesha County on behalf of Waukesha resident Richard Braun, alleges that use of the federal form is illegal because it doesn’t include places to fill in information such as whether a voter has been convicted of a felony and how long they have lived in their district. Wisconsin law is abundantly clear on the required content of voter registration forms in Wisconsin, yet WEC has somehow approved the use of a form that fails to meet those requirements,” said Anthony LoCoco, an attorney with the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty. “It is a shame that, once again, a voter has to go to court simply to ensure that WEC follows the Legislature’s lawful commands.” The lawsuit also takes issue with the form asking applicants to list their race and party affiliation, which aren’t required by law. The form’s instructions make clear that it’s optional for Wisconsin voters to provide the information.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://campaignlegal.org/update/virtual-event-scotus-watch-what-upcoming-supreme-court-term-means-democracy">SCOTUS Watch: What Upcoming Supreme Court Term Means for Democracy</a>: Join us for a conversation with Campaign Legal Center (CLC) democracy advocates and other special guests to sound the alarm on the U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts and what its troubling decisions mean for democracy. Together, they&#8217;ll talk about the upcoming cases that could dramatically alter the course of our democracy and the immediate and long-term impact of these decisions. <strong>When:</strong> September 28, 1:30pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/events/democracy-brink-nuestra-democracia-en-la-cuerda-floja">Democracy on the Brink</a>: Our democracy is under attack from people wrongly claiming that the 2020 election was somehow “stolen.” State lawmakers are acting on those false claims with legislation that restricts the right to vote and also undermines the election process itself. Add to that the growing problem of disinformation, which sometimes targets specific racial or ethnic groups. Join the Brennan Center for Justice and Brennan en español at NYU School of Law for a conversation about what these efforts mean for the 2022 elections and beyond. The discussion was held at a recent convention of the national associations of black and Latino journalists. This premiere YouTube stream will include a live text chat Q&amp;A with Brennan Center election expert Sean Morales-Doyle. This event was produced in partnership with the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. Spanish language interpretation will be available for this event. <strong>When:</strong> September 28, 6pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/disinformation-midterms-and-mind-how-psychological-science-can-help-journalists-combat">Disinformation, Midterms, and the Mind: How psychological science can help journalists combat election misinformation</a>: Journalism and democracy have been upended by the growth of mis- and dis-information. Countering it effectively requires understanding why people are susceptible, targeted, and how they can become more resilient. Psychological research can teach journalists how to prebunk disinformation and convey credibility in ways that readers, viewers, and listeners can process, which is more essential than ever as November’s elections near. Register now to join the National Press Club Journalism Institute, the American Psychological Association, and PEN America for a free program on Thursday, Sept. 29 to learn how to use these strategies for coverage that informs and empowers your community as it prepares to vote and to discuss the ways disinformation has affected the practice of journalism. The program, which will be held on Zoom, will begin at 11:30 a.m. ET and be followed by a Q&amp;A session. <strong>When:</strong> September 29, 11:30am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/voter-accessibility-improving-your-election-coverage-people-disabilities">Voter Accessibility: Improving your election coverage for people with disabilities</a>:  Midterm elections are Nov. 8. Are you prepared to be a watchdog for disabled voters in your communities? What is your newsroom doing to ensure your election coverage is useful and accessible for disabled voters? How are you covering voter rights and accessibility leading up to and on Election Day?  More than 61 million Americans live with disabilities, yet they remain underrepresented in journalism produced by U.S. newsrooms. As a decisive midterm election approaches, recent coverage shows state and local measures intend to: reduce <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2022/08/19/u-s-doj-intervenes-on-behalf-of-disabled-voters-in-lawsuit-to-protect-absentee-ballot-assistance/">voting by absentee ballot</a>, <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2022/08/22/election-disability-experts-testify-as-trial-over-election-laws-enters-week-two/">limit access at polling locations</a>, and limit information explaining how people with disabilities can <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/07/26/voting-disabled-community-elections/10143455002/">cast their ballots</a>. Join the National Press Club Journalism Institute for a virtual discussion among experts in voter access, disability representation, and accessible news coverage on best practices to cover disabled voters and to highlight voting access issues they may face.  <strong>When:</strong> October 14, 11:30am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eac.gov/events/2022/10/06/path-end-end-e2e-protocols-voting-systems">The Path to End-to-End (E2E) Protocols for Voting Systems</a>:  The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), in collaboration with NIST, is initiating a process to publicly solicit, evaluate, and approve protocols used in end-to-end (E2E) cryptographically verifiable voting systems for conformance to the recently revised Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, Version 2.0. This workshop will be used to discuss the plan and further develop the protocol requirements and evaluation criteria. This workshop will cover the following: A keynote presentation on E2E in voting systems; Four discussion-based panels covering: Integrity and Voter Confidence, Voting System Security, Accessibility and Human Factor Considerations, Implementation of E2E in Voting Systems/Testings; Next Steps; Q&amp;A Session <strong>When:</strong> October 6 &amp; 7, 1pm-5pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/npc-headliners-book-event-major-garrett-and-david-becker-big-truth">NPC Headliners Book Event: Major Garrett and David Becker, &#8220;The Big Truth&#8221;</a>: Less than a month before the midterm elections, CBS Chief Washington Correspondent Major Garrett and David Becker, one of the nation&#8217;s leading elections experts, will discuss their new book, &#8220;The Big Truth: Upholding Democracy in the Age of THE BIG LIE,&#8221; at a National Press Club headliners book event. Garrett and Becker&#8217;s new book examines the potentially dire consequences for the 2022 midterms and beyond. Filled with interviews with key players — election workers, January 6th Committee members Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md), Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and more — they take a close look at what is known as the Big Lie. Garrett, a veteran Washington correspondent, and Becker, the Executive Director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Integrity, make a case that Big Lie “fraud” allegations evaporate under scrutiny. The authors examine what actually happened in 2020, while reporting on what they call each Trumpian misdirection designed to con and beguile Americans into chasing phantom allegations of election crimes. The authors argue that the next midterm and presidential elections will test American democracy more severely than at any time since the Civil War, arguing that how Americans react may determine whether the country is led into another war against itself. The program will include a question-and-answer session with Garrett and Becker. <strong>When:</strong> October 11. <strong>Where:</strong> National Press Club, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><a href="https://voteearlyday.org/">Vote Early Day</a>: Vote Early Day is a nonpartisan movement of media companies, businesses, nonprofits, election administrators, and creatives working to ensure all Americans have the tools to vote early. This holiday is a tentpole moment for partners of all stripes to engage with voters and urge them to cast their ballots. Created in 2020, Vote Early Day has brought thousands of national and local partners together in celebration and activation to increase the number of people voting early. This collaborative, open-source model—similar to Giving Tuesday and National Voter Registration Day—ensures that millions more Americans take advantage of their options to vote early through on the ground activations, get-out-the-vote pushes, national communications on traditional and social media, and efforts to create a new culture around voting. Vote Early Day plays a unique role in the push to get voters to cast their ballot. We are a trusted, nonpartisan holiday with supporters on both sides of the aisle. We provide a central moment for a wide range of partners (many non- traditional to the civic space) to engage with voters and urge them to vote early. Our collaboration of thousands of diverse partners allows us to engage in places beyond where voters are used to seeing election messages. This allows us to break through the noise and meet voters where they are. <strong>When:</strong> October 28</p>

<p><a href="https://airtable.com/shrMTHCuL0HXKtllb">Arizona Deputy Coordinator</a>, U.S. Elections, The Carter Center— The Democracy Program at The Carter Center works globally to support and strengthen participatory democracy, consistent with human rights. Beginning in 2020, The Carter Center began efforts to support elections in the United States. There are multiple key aspects to this project: establishing nonpartisan observation efforts, tracking disinformation and dangerous speech, contributing to electoral reform, and promoting candidate codes of conduct. The Carter Center is advancing nonpartisan observation efforts in two key states: Arizona and Michigan. These states were selected following assessments completed on multiple states. Nonpartisan observation efforts implemented and/or supported by The Carter Center will differ from existing partisan poll watchers and election-protection groups. The goal of nonpartisan observation is to provide credible and transparent information on the conduct of elections in each state through public reports. The Deputy Coordinator will execute the citizen observation plan and develop partnerships with community-based organizations. They will report directly to the US Elections Coordinator in [Michigan/Arizona] and to the US Elections team in Atlanta. <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply,<a href="https://airtable.com/shrMTHCuL0HXKtllb"> click here</a>.</p>
