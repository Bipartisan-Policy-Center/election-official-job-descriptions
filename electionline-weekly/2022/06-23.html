														<p><strong>“It’s turned my life upside down…”</strong><br />
<em>The Carter Center releases a well-being resource guide</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Election officials and their staff are under more pressure than ever.</p>
<p>Nowhere has that been more clear than the testimony from Fulton County, Georgia election worker Wandrea &#8220;Shaye&#8221; Moss who testified this week before the Select Committee on Jan. 6.</p>
<div id="attachment_8513" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8513" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-8513" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-12.29.33-PM-300x228.png" alt="" width="300" height="228" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-12.29.33-PM-300x228.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-12.29.33-PM-1024x777.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-12.29.33-PM-768x583.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-12.29.33-PM.png 1210w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8513" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Michael Reynolds/Getty Images</em></p></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s turned my life upside down. I no longer give out my business card&#8230; I don&#8217;t want anyone knowing my name,&#8221; Moss told the committee. &#8220;I don&#8217;t go to the grocery store at all. I haven&#8217;t been anywhere at all. I&#8217;ve gained about 60 pounds. I just don&#8217;t do nothing anymore,&#8221; she said during her<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/22/1106459556/shaye-moss-staffed-an-election-office-in-georgia-then-she-was-targeted-by-trump"> testimony</a>.</p>
<p>Threats, mis-dis-malinformation, a skeptical public, potential budget issues and staffing shortages. With all that pressure, it isn’t any wonder that mental health has become an issue for elections folks.</p>
<p>“Hilary Rudy [deputy elections director] and I bring up mental health every week at the full staff meeting, highlighting various services available through the state and by other means,” said Judd Choate, director of elections for the<a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/"> Colorado</a>. “I can’t really speak to how that’s played out, other than to say that many elections employees have taken advantage of these services.”</p>
<p>One new resource is “<a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/health_publications/mental_health/mental-well-being-guide-for-election-officials.pdf">Taking Care of Yourself to Serve Others: A Well-being Resource Guide for Elections Officials</a>” from<a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/"> The Carter Center</a>.</p>
<p>The guide is intended to provide resources to election officials to help support their own well-being and the well-being of their colleagues and teams. In it, officials will find information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Signs and Impacts of Trauma</li>
<li>Techniques for Promoting Resiliency and Recovery</li>
<li>Mental Health Support Near You</li>
<li>Online Security Tips and Toolkits</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-8512 alignright" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-11.22.24-AM-233x300.png" alt="" width="233" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-11.22.24-AM-233x300.png 233w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-11.22.24-AM-794x1024.png 794w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-11.22.24-AM-768x990.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-11.22.24-AM.png 948w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" />Avery Davis-Roberts, associate director of the Democracy Program at The Carter Center said the resource guide really started from listening to election officials tell their stories of what it&#8217;s been like to do their jobs in an at-times hostile environment, and seeing what happened to the storytellers, on a human level, as they were relaying their experience.</p>
<p>“Seasoned election officials, election officials with decades of experience were getting choked up telling their stories, or would then go on to tell us about the effects that they were still experiencing when alone in their homes, or picking up their kids from school,” Davis-Roberts said. “Seeing these involuntary responses that were triggered by reliving the experiences they had, made us think that tools and resources that could help people give a name to what they were feeling and experiencing, and knowing that they were not alone might be helpful.”</p>
<p>The Center&#8217;s Democracy and Mental Health Programs collaborated on the project. This was the second collaboration between programs with a focus on the United States &#8211; in 2020 they worked together on mental health resources and training for journalists covering elections.</p>
<p>As Choate in Colorado noted, states too are doing what they can to help their own employees as well as all the local officials. In<a href="https://www.michigan.gov/sos"> Michigan</a>, according to Tracy Wimmer, director of media relations for the secretary of state’s office, all state employees have access to the<a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdcs/employeebenefits/employee-service-prog"> Employee Service Program</a>, a mental health resource that is free and confidential. Clerks have also been offered access to video workshops through the Defense Health Agency that covered mental health and wellness.</p>

<p>Back in 2021,<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/"> The Brennan Center</a><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/election-officials-under-attack"> surveyed elections officials</a> and found that one in three election officials feel unsafe because of their job. Nearly one in five listed threats to their lives as a job-related concern, 78 percent said social media has made their job more difficult, and 54 percent said social media has made their job more dangerous. Many of you have received harassing phone calls and text messages and have had to hire personal security, relocate, and find other means of protecting yourselves and your families.</p>
<p>While several states have implemented laws to protect elections officials and state and federal authorities have stepped up their efforts to root out the sources of threats, and for the first time last week, prosecute them, a year later, things are not really any different.</p>
<p>In their<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/media/9197/download"> March 2022 survey</a> of local elections officials, The Brennan Center found that one in six elections officials reported being threatened. Nearly one in three know of at least one election worker who has left their job at least in part because of fears for their safety, increased threats, or intimidation and three in five are concerned that threats and harassment will make it harder to retain or recruit election workers going forward.</p>
<p>“A lot of emphasis has, understandably, been placed on pushing for legal responses to the threats and intimidation election officials have experienced,” Davis-Roberts said. “We felt that continuing to push for legal responses requires that people have the emotional resilience to do so.”</p>

							<h2>New Grant Opportunity from MEDSL</h2>
														<p><strong>MIT Election Data and Science Lab Announces New Grant Opportunity</strong><br />
<em>The Evolving Election Administration Landscape</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-6793" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT-300x51.png" alt="" width="371" height="63" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT-300x51.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MIT.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" />Thanks to support from the Election Performance Project, an initiative of the Pew Charitable Trusts, the MIT Election Data and Science Lab (MEDSL) has launched a $2 million grant program to support research projects that illuminate how the evolving election administration landscape has changed in light of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, broadly considered.</p>
<p>Information about the grant program, which was released last Tuesday, can be found at the following URL: <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/projects/learning-from-elections"> https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/projects/learning-from-elections</a>. (Scroll to the bottom to get the full request for proposals.) The Evolving Election Administration Landscape program plans to support between 15 and 20 projects, with budgets in the range of $50,000 to $200,000.</p>
<p>While the grant program is aimed at research to be conducted at universities and other non-profits, a critical goal is to encourage active collaboration between these researchers and the election administration community, both at the local and state levels.  While university-practitioner collaboration isn’t an absolute requirement, proposals with such an element will have a leg-up over others.</p>
<p>This research program is launched at a critical moment in the nation’s election administration.  The current January 6 hearings have underscored the partisan divisions that attend election administration these days, as well as threats of violence against election officials and misinformation.  Even without these developments, responding to voting during the pandemic has caused disruptions in how elections are conducted and raised questions about what the “new normal” should be.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the grant opportunity, entitled The Evolving Election Administration Landscape, proceeds with an assumption that there is an audience (and even a hunger) for fact-based analysis of election administration that will inform the evolution of law and professional practice in the coming years.</p>
<p>As the RFP indicates, there are specific highlighted areas of research the program seeks to support—mail balloting, voter registration, polling places and voter experience, institutional capacity, and combatting misinformation and building trust.</p>
<p>The 2022 election is fast approaching (July 22 and August 12), as are the application deadlines.  To help answer questions and encourage applications, MEDSL will be holding two webinars, on June 24 and June 30.  Details about registering are on the website linked-to above.</p>
<p>How can election officials be involved?  The simplest answer is to reach out to friendly academics you’ve worked with to see if they’re up to working with you to design a project and apply.  Don’t know any academics?  Reach out to MEDSL through the grant project’s e-mail (medsl-grants@mit.edu) and we’ll try to do some match-making.</p>
<p>MEDSL understands that mid-summer right before a national election is not the best time to be putting together major research projects focused on that election.  Yet, the opportunities—both from the likely finding and the research community that will be built—seem great.</p>

This was the<a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/06/21/dc-primary-day-voting-candidates/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=engagingnetworks&amp;utm_campaign=DCIST_DAILY_06_22_2022&amp;utm_content=DCist+Daily+-+6/21/22"> District</a>’s first official vote-by-mail/vote center election, although it had been used during the pandemic. While there was snarking on social media (isn’t there always?) overall the election ran smoothly with few reported problems. At presstime turnout was about 23% which was higher than in 2018. One of DC’s election day vote centers is also one of the city’s COVID centers and parents with children under 5 were able to vote and get their charges vaccinated. “Our experience is really good, very fast, very efficient,” said Tashi, who declined to give his last name, saying he wanted to protect his privacy. His children were cheerful and circled around him. “The staff at both locations are very nice, very helpful,” he added. In<a href="https://wtop.com/local-politics-elections-news/2022/06/voters-head-to-polls-to-decide-primaries-in-dc-va/"> Virginia</a>, many of the candidates were unopposed, and several ballot spots were determined by closed, party-sponsored events, such as conventions and firehouse primaries. “There was nobody waiting in line when we opened the polls at 6 a.m., which is almost unheard of,” Bob McCall chief election officer for<a href="https://starexponent.com/news/local/in-person-voting-moves-at-snails-pace-in-culpeper/article_6870e10e-6d30-59fc-86dd-ffd45e701e61.html"> Culpeper</a>’s East Fairfax precinct said. “We’d had seven people by 7 and 10 by 8, and that’s really how things have plodded along all day.” On the runoff front it was also very quiet with few problems. In<a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/06/21/issue-montgomery-county-voting-software-extends-polling-time/7689205001/"> Alabama</a> software issues extended voting by about 45 minutes in one county, but other than that it was relatively quiet.<a href="https://www.wvua23.com/allen-claims-secretary-of-state-nomination-sorrell-wins-auditor/"> Wes Allen</a> won the runoff to represent the Republicans in the secretary of state race. Turnout for the runoff election in<a href="https://www.wvua23.com/allen-claims-secretary-of-state-nomination-sorrell-wins-auditor/"> Arkansas</a> was low with few, if any reported problems. Voter turnout was low in<a href="https://www.tribuneledgernews.com/local_news/tuesday-voter-turnout-slow-no-problems-reported-at-local-precincts-elections-director-says/article_8edab7b2-f18d-11ec-a140-5f5b2fdbe0ac.html"> Georgia</a>’s runoffs with few problems reported.

The numbers don&#8217;t lie.&#8221; Raffensperger said some of Trump&#8217;s followers &#8220;started going after&#8221; his wife and others broke into his daughter-in-law&#8217;s home. Nonetheless, he didn&#8217;t quit his job, &#8220;because I knew that we did follow the law, we followed the Constitution. I think sometimes moments require you to stand up and just take the shots. You&#8217;re doing your job. That&#8217;s all we did.&#8221; The testimony of Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman who also worked for Fulton County during the 2020 election was<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/06/21/harrowing-aftermath-counting-votes/"> particularly emotional</a>. “I’ve always been told by my grandmother how important it is to vote and how people before me, a lot of people, older people in my family, did not have that right. So what I loved the most about my job were the older voters,” testified Moss. “Older voters like to call; they like to talk to you; they like to get my card; they like to know that every election, I’m here. Even college students, a lot of parents trusted me to make sure their child does not have to drive home — they’ll get an absentee ballot. They can vote. I really found pleasure in that.” Moss talked about the threats she and her mother have faced since 2020. “It’s turned my life upside down. I no longer give out my business card,” she said. “I don’t want anyone knowing my name. I don’t want to go anywhere with my mom because she might yell my name out over the grocery aisle or something.

According to<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-score/2022/06/21/election-administrators-go-to-washington-00040904"> Politico</a>, the campaign will arm election officials with a broad set of asks that many in the field have held for ages: A “significant and regular investment” in election infrastructure, new funding specifically for threat monitoring, more federal protections against threats and intimidation against election workers, more privacy protections — and a “bipartisan update” to the Electoral Count Act. “Anyone who cares about preserving our freedoms, particularly our leaders in Congress, should pay attention and support these individuals with the tools and resources they need to keep the machinery of our democracy running,” Dokhi Fassihian, deputy chief of strategy and program at Issue One, said in a statement. The push will also<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxRWwzPOrIs&amp;ab_channel=IssueOne"> include a digital ad</a> featuring election officials pushing for more support from D.C. that will run on the sites of “major news outlets” as well.</p>

That’s double the rejection rate from the 2020 primary. “These huge number of rejected ballots are occurring predominantly in rural Alaska, huge Native populations and in low-income areas of Alaska,” said Anchorage Sen. Bill Wielechowski. He’s among a half-dozen Alaska Senate Democrats demanding answers from the Division of Elections about why so many ballots weren’t counted. The rejection percentage varies starkly by region. In areas near Bethel, it’s the highest, at around 17%. That means about 1 in every 6 ballots was rejected — with the votes not counted. The rejection rate is above 10% in the Kotzebue and Utqiaġvik area, as well as around Nome and Bristol Bay. Across rural Alaska, the rejection rate is roughly 1 in 8.  That’s compared to about 4% so far in Anchorage. In the<a href="https://aksenatedems.com/docs/2022-06-14-Caucus-Letter-to-DOE-re-VBM-Rejections-Final.pdf"> letter to Division of Elections officials</a>, Wielechowski and the other senators asked for an explanation about what they described as a “breakdown of our election system and the democratic process for those citizens whose votes were not counted.” “It’s really imperative for Division of Elections to get a handle on this,” Wielechowski said in an interview Thursday. “Figure out what the problem is, and either figure out a way to educate the voters, or remove these unnecessary bureaucratic barriers that are being placed that are making it difficult for low-income and Native voters to vote.” Division of Elections officials said they’ll have data on why the ballots were rejected after the election is certified on June 25. Additionally, after one of the top four candidates dropped out, the<a href="https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/06/21/alaska-elections-official-says-fifth-place-finisher-cant-fill-vacancy-on-us-house-ballot-sweeney-campaign-disagrees/"> fifth place candidate is seeking to be considered</a> part of the final four. But the Division of Elections announced its interpretation Tuesday afternoon: “Because this withdrawal occurred less than 64 days before the election, Alaska law does not permit the fifth-place candidate to advance,” Elections Director Gail Fenumiai said in a letter.</p>

She was 78. While elections were part of Rorex’s job as clerk, what she’s most famous for is being recognized as the first government official to issue a same-sex marriage license, all the way back in 1975. According to The Daily Camera, Rorex ended up issuing a total of six same-sex marriage licenses before the Attorney General ordered her to stop. Though it was not recognized immediately, her actions became a pivotal moment for marriage equality. None of the six licenses were ever revoked or invalidated. Former Boulder County Commissioner Josie Heath worked with a group in the ’70s that encouraged more women to run for elected offices. She said she wanted the women who wanted to really be involved in the community to run for office, which is how she came across Rorex. “What she did was definitely a little bit scary at the time, but I really admire her for pushing the envelope and standing up for what she believed in,” Heath told the Daily Camera. “I am thrilled that she was able to be honored in her lifetime, because it took a long time for the country to catch up with her first actions that were so important to the equality movement.”</p>

The Colorado Legislature previously approved a law to ban open carrying of firearms in and around voting centers. Pitkin County wanted to beef up the ban. The county government will have signs printed as soon as possible that say “No firearms, open or concealed.” The concealed handguns ban is largely symbolic. After conferring with Sheriff Joe DiSalvo, the commissioners decided it would be too costly to install metal detectors at three polling places established for the current primary or the general election in November. If election judges suspect someone of packing, discreetly or not, they will call 911 and seek help from the sheriff’s office. Someone violating Pitkin County’s new ban would be face a civil penalty of $50 for the first offense, according to County Attorney John Ely.</p>

State Sen. Kyle Evans Gay’s (D-Talleyville) bill faced stiff opposition from Republicans, and particularly state Sen. Colin Bonini (R-Dover), who stalled last week’s session for hours and introduced more than two dozen amendments to the bill. Most of those amendments would have pushed back the bill’s effective date. One that passed requires voters to provide a driver&#8217;s license number or last four digits of a social security number on their vote-by-mail application and ballot envelope. The bill received<a href="https://www.delawarepublic.org/politics-government/2022-06-22/delaware-senate-passes-same-day-voter-registration-bill"> final passage</a> this week and it now heads to the governor’s desk.</p>

The vote comes a week after the Senate voted 37-3 in favor of the proposal. The bill would also increase ballot access for voters with disabilities and service members overseas. It would make sure eligible voters who are incarcerated can request a mail-in ballot and take steps to modernize the state’s election administration process. The legislation is a compromise version of separate bills approved earlier by House and Senate lawmakers. The final bill does not include any provisions that would let individuals both register and vote on Election Day. The bill would let registered voters vote by mail for any presidential, state or municipal primary or election; set aside two weeks — including two weekends — of early voting in-person for biennial state elections and one week — including one weekend — for presidential or state primaries; and move the voter registration deadline from 20 to 10 days before a preliminary, primary, or general election. Baker<a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/06/22/baker-signs-voting-bill-elections-massachusetts"> signed the bill</a> into law. “Every voter in Massachusetts can expect to receive a pre-addressed, postage pre-paid Vote by Mail application in just a few weeks.

Chris Sununu has signed Senate Bill 418 into law. The legislation creates a new type of<a href="https://www.wcax.com/2022/06/17/sununu-signs-affidavit-ballot-bill-voters-without-id/"> “affidavit ballot” for first-time voters</a> in New Hampshire who don’t have required documents. Under current law, such voters fill out affidavits promising to provide documentation within 10 days, and those who don’t can be investigated and charged with fraud. But the votes themselves remain valid. Under the new law, which takes effect in 2023, ballots cast by voters who fail to provide proof of their identities and residency seven days after an election would be thrown out. Municipalities would report to the secretary of state total votes, minus the unqualified affidavit ballot votes, no later than 14 days after an election. Sununu said that Secretary of State David Scanlan “has given me his full assurances that this bill does not affect the state’s ability to get military ballots out on time, and that our processes will work without delay or impediments with its passage.”</p>
<p>New Hampshire<a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-education-new-hampshire-voter-registration-5983919d40f77bb185579287836e16be"> students with disabilities</a> will get help registering to vote under a new law that will take effect in August. The new law requires school officials, parents, and students with disabilities who are 17 or older to discuss voter registration as part of their special education planning for life after graduation. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Mark Paige, said he introduced the legislation after hearing from parents who wanted to be sure that their children graduate ready to be full civic participants in their communities. “Just having that conversation about registering delivers an empowering message to the student,” said Paige, D-Exeter. “It says: we need you involved; your voice and vote matter, and when you use them, you can have an impact.”</p>

Voters would be able to see the number of votes cast, counted, and remaining to be counted broken down by how a ballot was cast whether by machine during early voting or on Election Day, by mail, or provisionally. Assembly Bill 3822 (A-3822) would enable mail-in ballots to be processed, but not counted, beginning five days before an election in order for the unofficial results of both in-person and by-mail votes to be reported together as soon after the close of polls as possible. Processing ballots involves verifying voter signatures and physically opening and preparation of ballots for tabulation. Currently, election officials must retrieve ballots from drop boxes every day, which in some communities is unnecessary and puts a strain on limited resources. To resolve this time-consuming and potentially costly requirement, the bill would additionally enable county elections officials to establish a pickup schedule to which officials from both parties agree.</p>

Kathy Hochul signed the<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/hochul-marks-juneteenth-holiday-by-signing-new-york-voting-rights-act"> John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of New York</a>, which aims to prevent voter suppression or dilution based on race or language preference, at a ceremony in Brooklyn. The legislation passed both chambers in the final week of the legislative session in party line votes. Among its provisions, it prohibits local election administrators from taking actions that could suppress votes based on race; for instance reducing the number of poll sites in a jurisdiction with voters of color. It also requires election administrators in jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to seek pre-clearance, an authorization before the change is made, from the state attorney general’s office or a local court. “As always, when the federal government fails to act, you can count on New York to punch back and fight even harder,” Hochul said, adding, “No state in the nation has stood up with the courage and the conviction and the power that we have by protecting these important rights.”</p>

Both bills had already passed the state Senate and were approved for consideration by the full House. The bill to move the presidential primary to the third Tuesday in March vote was 16-8, with two Democrats joining all Republicans in favor. The <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2021&amp;sInd=0&amp;body=S&amp;type=B&amp;bn=0573">poll watchers’ bill</a>, sponsored by the current GOP gubernatorial nominee, Sen. Doug Mastriano of Franklin County, would give candidates the right to have an additional observer and post them inside, close enough to see any canvassing and precanvassing. “There’s no reason to have poll watchers if they aren’t able to be in the line of sight and clearly see what’s happening,” said Republican Rep. Paul Schemel of Franklin County. Rep. Eric Nelson, R-Westmoreland, called the bill “a clear opportunity to allow voters to have enhanced confidence and belief that we’re achieving election integrity.” Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s spokeswoman said he is firmly opposed to the poll watcher bill.</p>

Such a list is to begin with the November election, if it becomes law. The bill originally called for a 90-day turnaround, but after hearing from Supervisor of Elections Caroline Fawkes agreed to a change the more expedient 30-day turnaround. “We would like to enact this law 30 days after the governor signs. Our goal is to obtain an accurate voters’ participation rate for the 2022 general election because during the four-year cycle, which is when the gubernatorial race is on the ballot, more voters participate,” Fawkes said. “The ESVI does not want to see the fruits of our labor in 2024. We have the tools necessary to begin this process. We can change the status of non-voters in the 2014 through 2020 general elections from active to inactive beginning 30 days after the passage of this legislation.” To not allow for cancellation, she said, puts the agency’s data in jeopardy as the numbers and percentages of active voters radically changes and is not as accurate without the cancellations of inactive voters. “Statistical information is critical in many areas, especially in analyzing the elections results. Our goal in supporting this bill is to obtain, true, accurate statistical information and to inspire, encourage, and energize all our citizens to participate in the electoral process, as done in many other countries,” Fawkes said.</p>

The board is eyeing an August vote — likely in conjunction with this year’s primary elections — on a package of charter changes they reviewed and tentatively endorsed this week. According to the Times Argus, days away from a midterm retirement she announced back in April, Town Clerk Rosemary Morse may have inadvertently set the stage for a change she publicly discouraged in the letter advising the board she would step down on June 30. Attempts to persuade Morse to serve out her latest term — one that expires in March — were unsuccessful and the board scrambled to come up with the succession plan they recently settled on. With two elections looming, that plan involved appointing Assistant Town Clerk Corinne Cooper to replace Morse until voters have a chance to elect her replacement on Town Meeting Day in March. Technically, that’s still the plan, though it is now fraught with uncertainty amid fresh drama involving Cooper’s recent disclosure she planned to appoint her daughter, Minda Stridsberg, to serve as her interim assistant.</p>

The proposal, called “<a href="https://mynorthwest.com/3528233/approval-voting-debate-initiative-seattle-nov-2022-ballot/">approval voting</a>,” allows voters to select every candidate they approve in primary elections. The two candidates with the highest number of votes would advance to a general election, which voters would then be allowed to choose between the two. The group behind the initiative, Seattle Approves, submitted just over the 26,520 signatures necessary to qualify the measure for November’s ballot, according to King County Elections. Approval voting, under I-134, will be on the November 2022 ballot after receiving the necessary amount of signatures.</p>

Davis denied a motion from Newsmax to dismiss the case, saying the company “knew the allegations were probably false” about the voting technology and “there were enough signs indicating the statements were not true to infer Newsmax’s intent to avoid the truth.” “Given that Newsmax apparently refused to report contrary evidence, including evidence from the Department of Justice, the allegations support the reasonable inference that Newsmax intended to keep Dominion’s side of the story out of the mainstream,” Davis wrote in his opinion.</p>
<p>Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fox-news-parent-must-face-defamation-lawsuit-over-election-coverage-2022-06-21/"> rejected a motion by the parent of Fox News Network</a> to dismiss Dominion Voting Systems Inc&#8217;s $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit over the network&#8217;s 2020 presidential election coverage. Dominion accused Fox of trying to avoid viewer defections to conservative rivals Newsmax and One America News by amplifying false theories that the company rigged the 2020 election so Republican Donald Trump would lose to Democrat Joe Biden. In court papers, Dominion claimed that Fox Corp, through Chairman Rupert Murdoch and his son Chief Executive Lachlan Murdoch directly participated in, approved and controlled the network&#8217;s election coverage and its aftermath. Without ruling on the merits, Davis said the allegations permitted &#8220;reasonable&#8221; inferences that Fox Corp acted with malice and proximately caused Dominion&#8217;s alleged damages. &#8220;Dominion has adequately pleaded actual malice with respect to Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch,&#8221; the judge wrote. Davis dismissed a related defamation claim against another Fox entity, Fox Broadcasting, for posting the challenged statements on fox.com, citing a lack of evidence that anyone there was &#8220;subjectively aware of anything.&#8221;</p>

The Justice Department’s investigation found that applications and renewals for Alaska’s driver’s licenses and identification documents did not consistently serve as voter registration applications for federal office as required by the NVRA. Likewise, the procedures by which citizens notify the state’s motor vehicle office that their address had changed did not serve as a notification of change of address for voter registration purposes. Under the terms of the settlement, Alaska will fully integrate a voter registration opportunity into all applications for driver’s licenses and other identification documents. Alaska will also ensure that all change of address information submitted for driver’s licenses or state-issued identification purposes will be used to update voters’ address information unless a voter declines to update their voter registration. Alaska has also agreed to appoint a Division of Motor Vehicles NVRA coordinator and NVRA site coordinators for each Division of Motor Vehicles office.</p>

Napper had signaled at a hearing last week that many of the complaints Brnovich raised when he refused to approve an updated Election Procedures Manual Hobbs submitted for his review and approval last October were unsupported. He said Hobbs in most cases had followed the law when she wrote the manual for voting and tallying ballots. In his ruling, Napper said Brnovich had waited so long to sue over his perceived problems with the manual that he could not order the few changes that may be merited. Napper instead sided with Hobbs and GOP Gov. Doug Ducey’s position and said the last manual approved by all three in 2019 would be in effect for the upcoming elections. &#8220;At this point in the game, there is no mechanism for the Court to assist the parties in constructing an EMP which complies with (the law) within the timelines of the statute,&#8221; Napper wrote. &#8220;The Complaint was filed far too late for this to occur without disrupting elections that have already begun.</p>

Ford told a federal judge that he posted the messages on Instagram after the 2020 election. According to court documents, one said, “Do you feel safe? You shouldn’t. Do you think Soros will/can protect you?”  Another said, “Your security detail is far too thin and incompetent to protect you. The world is unpredictable these days&#8230;.anything can happen to anyone,” followed by a man-shrugging emoji. Prosecutors said Ford told law enforcement officers in an interview that his posts went “far far far beyond free speech” and “far past the line.”   He pleaded guilty to using a telecommunications device to issue a threat and faces up to two years in prison. The judge set Oct. 6 as the date for his sentencing.</p>

In a May 25 lawsuit filed in Hillsborough Circuit Court, Hardam Hitarth Tripathi of Lakeland is seeking public records from Latimer and consultant Vistra Communications of Lutz documenting how the grant was used. Vistra devised and implemented a wide-ranging voter education campaign on Latimer’s behalf in fall 2020 that included advertisements on television, radio, billboards, ride-share vehicles, gas pumps, movie screens, airport displays, print news publications and social media. The suit alleges that records obtained so far from Latimer’s office by Tripathi “provides a basis for believing that the campaign was in fact a partisan get-out-the-vote campaign, and that the supervisor of elections attempted to obscure this fact.” “That baseless attack on my integrity is something I will not let stand,” Latimer responded in a statement to the Tampa Bay Times. “As supervisor of elections, I do want to get out the vote, and there is nothing partisan about it. “I want every eligible resident to be registered, and every registered voter to vote. Voter education goes hand in hand with increasing turnout, because voters who don’t know how, where or when they can vote may miss out on the opportunity,” he said.</p>

But the appeals court argued their fears about the law were unfounded and the quartet of organizations had not demonstrated House Bill 2183 had actually harmed their work. In a lawsuit filed last year, Loud Light, the League of Women Voters Kansas, Kansas Appleseed and Topeka Independent Living Resource Center challenged several elements of the sweeping election bill, including provisions related to who can deliver an advanced mail ballot and signature verification. But the groups asked the courts to block the law from taking effect because of a specific provision criminalizing the impersonation of an election official. The groups have said they have paused their voter registration work ahead of the Aug. 2 primary election because of the law. The Court of Appeals ruled the plaintiffs lacked the standing to file a lawsuit because they weren&#8217;t tangibly harmed by the law. They didn&#8217;t render a verdict on the permissibility of the law itself.</p>

During the morning hearing was unpersuaded by the legislative leaders that they required more time to complete that once-a-decade task of redistricting. Dick additionally described the efforts by House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, on the first day of the six-day special session, as “disingenuous” and “insincere.” “With five days to work with they met for 90 minutes,” Dick said of the state House’s brief gathering Wednesday. Last week, Dick threw out the adopted map for violating the Voting Rights Act and ordered lawmakers to create a new one with a second majority Black district by June 20. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal briefly put a hold on Dick’s deadline, but removed that hold Sunday. The appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments on the case July 8. “The evidence of Louisiana’s long and ongoing history of voting-related discrimination weighs heavily in favor of Plaintiffs,” Dick wrote in the ruling.</p>

It’s the latest of dozens of voting-related lawsuits across the U.S., as election procedures have come under increased scrutiny both from those seeking to guarantee access and ensure integrity. The federal Voting Rights Act allows people who have disabilities or are unable to read or write to choose someone to help them vote. A 1977 Missouri law outlines a similar procedure but says no one can assist more than one voter per election unless they are an election judge or helping immediate family members. Violations of state election laws can result in up to a year imprisonment and up to a $2,500 fine.  “This lawsuit seeks to prevent the state from punishing some of democracy’s do-gooders – those who take time to assist voters who are informed and eager to cast a ballot,” said Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.</p>

In a federal suit lodged last month, the Public Interest Legal Foundation sued Secretary of State Tahesha Way, alleging her department violated federal law when it denied the organization’s Open Public Records Act request for documents on how the state clears duplicate voter registrations. Lauren Bowman, a foundation spokeswoman, said the group performed data analysis of New Jersey’s voter rolls that found more than 8,000 people registered more than once. The New Jersey Department of State denied the group’s records request in March, saying their release would “expose critical vulnerability within the state’s election process” because they detail how to make discrete changes to the Statewide Voter Registration System. “If disclosed, this information would create a grave risk to the integrity of New Jersey’s election system,” the department said in its denial.</p>

Supreme Court to consider felon voting as early as August. Legislators’ alternative plan would delay the case until at least October. The brief xplains why lawmakers object to an expedited hearing schedule in the case called Community Success Initiative v. Moore. The case could add 56,000 felons to N.C. voting rolls as early as November. It would apply to felons who have completed active prison time but still face probation, parole, or post-release supervision. Under normal rules, legislative leaders would face a mid-July deadline to file an opening brief with the state Supreme Court. Final paperwork would be due around Sept. 1. Plaintiffs in the case have asked the court to speed up the timeline, with a July 7 deadline for the opening brief and an Aug. 8 due date for final paperwork.</p>

Tennesseans with prior in-state felony convictions can restore their rights in a few ways, including by having their citizenship restored by fulfilling their obligations through paying court costs and restitution. In theory, the same pathway is open to everyone equally.  But some newer Tennesseans with out-of-state felonies never had court costs to pay and court documents show they&#8217;ve struggled to prove their eligibility. The lawsuit, filed in 2020, argues the distinction is illegal and should be blocked in the courts. Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle dismissed the case in October 2020 after denying an initial motion from the residents asking that the rules be changed before that year&#8217;s August primary election. This announcement is the latest step in the appeals process &#8220;Until the Plaintiffs meet the same requirements as Tennessee felons seeking reinstatement of their right to vote, Tennessee law does not require that Tennessee reach the same result as Virginia’s Governor or North Carolina’s Legislature — nor does the Tennessee Constitution,&#8221; Lyle wrote.</p>

Local Republican party officials argued the county&#8217;s ballot transport protocol violated state election law. The lawsuit, filed just hours before polls closed on Election Day, could have caused serious delays in counting ballots on May 24 had the Texas Supreme Court agreed with the Harris County GOP that the plan was unlawful. Instead, the court did not issue an opinion and election night ballot counting proceeded uneventfully at NRG Arena.</p>
