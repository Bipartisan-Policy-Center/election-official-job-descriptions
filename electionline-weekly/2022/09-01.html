							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Communicating in the Age of Disinformation</strong><br />
<em>Strategies for Election Offices</em></p>
<p>By Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, executive director<br />
<a href="https://namle.net/">National Association for Media Literacy Education</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8438" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NAMLE-300x93.png" alt="" width="300" height="93" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NAMLE-300x93.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NAMLE.png 538w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Elections are complex and communicating about them to constituents in a digestible and easy way can be difficult. Add disinformation campaigns and conspiracy theories and you’ll find conversations are fraught with tension and frustration for all involved. Communicating with your constituents about election facts and highlighting your role as trusted source for election information is vital but tricky when false information is prevalent and spreads quickly. It can be hard to figure out where to even start when a constituent approaches you with falsehoods to share.</p>
<p>A good place to start is by determining if you are communicating with someone who is misinformed versus someone who is uninformed. Identifying the difference will impact how you communicate with them. Consider these factors when determining if someone is misinformed or uninformed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-8789" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-01-at-10.50.12-AM.png" alt="" width="701" height="275" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-01-at-10.50.12-AM.png 1250w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-01-at-10.50.12-AM-300x118.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-01-at-10.50.12-AM-1024x401.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-01-at-10.50.12-AM-768x301.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" /></p>
<p>A misinformed person might say, “I saw it on TV with my own eyes so I know it’s true.” An uninformed person might say,  “I saw it on TV. Is it true?” While the variation might seem small, it is a vastly different approach. An uninformed person is looking for answers. A misinformed person is determined to be right.</p>
<p>When communicating with uninformed people, listen and answer their questions. Point them in the direction of more information and resources. When communicating with misinformed people, remember facts do not counter a person’s belief. (See my previous article from July 28, 2022<a href="https://electionline.org/electionline-weekly/2022/07-28/"> Understanding Why People Believe Conspiracy Theories</a> for more information.)</p>
<p><strong>Instead, try these tactics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empathize with the amount of information that is available for consumption and acknowledge that they have come to you for information. Here’s an example of what you might say:</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8655" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lies-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lies-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lies-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lies.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“There’s so much information out there about elections. It can certainly be difficult to decipher where to find the most reliable information. I am glad you contacted us.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer to give them more information. Don’t assume they want it. Here’s an example of what you might say:</li>
</ul>
<p>“Would it be helpful to you if I explained how we work to keep elections safe and secure in our state? I’d be happy to share information and resources with you.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Be clear on how much time you are willing to spend on these conversations; know that you won’t change their minds. Here’s an example of what you might say:</li>
</ul>
<p>“I appreciate your call and am glad you reached out to us. It is clear that there is nothing I can say that could give you confidence in the work we do. I am sorry about that because we all care very deeply for our democracy and keeping elections safe and secure.  If you do ever want to learn more, please reach out or utilize the resources on our website. Thank you.”</p>
<p>When talking with constituents who believe false information, it is tempting to want to respond to every specific concern. However, it’s impossible to address every single issue separately. The best strategy is to address patterns of disinformation, rather than specific incidents. If not, you will be spending all your time debunking falsehoods. By now, we can anticipate some patterns of false narratives about elections. For example, we know we are going to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>False information about how to vote</li>
<li>False information about election integrity</li>
<li>False information about safety at polling places</li>
<li>False information about election results</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6599" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/misinformation-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/misinformation-300x150.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/misinformation.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Be prepared with general talking points about where to find accurate and reliable information. For example, let’s say you see this on your social media feed:</p>
<p><em>Did you see this video? It’s a van leaving the largest voting location with uncounted ballots.</em></p>
<p>Rather than debunking that specific claim, be ready with a response that covers the type of false information they are spreading. For example:</p>
<p><em>Images and videos of the election process are often taken out of context and misunderstood. Check with your election officials for reliable information.</em></p>
<p>Here’s another example of something you might see on your social media feeds:</p>
<p><em>Did you see this article? Election officials are stealing the election right from under our noses.</em></p>
<p>Here’s a potential response:</p>
<p><em>We are Americans who care deeply about democracy. We work every day to keep our elections safe and secure. Check with us for reliable information about elections.</em></p>
<p>Also, be prepared with talking points to interrupt the flow of false information online. For example:</p>
<p><em>We are seeing a lot of false information on this thread. Please visit us at XXX for reliable information about elections.</em></p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><em>We appreciate your concerns about keeping our elections safe and secure. That’s the work we do every day. Visit us at xxx for the most up to date information.</em></p>
<p>In your communication, don’t repeat false information. Direct people to the facts. And remember, do not try to change people’s minds. Rather, be prepared with accurate information about how your office keeps elections safe and secure. Your office is the source of reliable information about elections. This is a message that needs repeating, over and over again.</p>

The primary election went<a href="https://www.postguam.com/news/gec-election-as-smooth-as-it-could-get/article_c2dcce80-2732-11ed-830f-278df6550dd6.html"> &#8220;as smooth as it could get&#8221;</a> from the perspective of Guam Election Commission executive director Maria Pangelinan. &#8220;I have a permanent staff that are very seasoned. Our temporary staff we started picking them up in June so they did a fantastic job,&#8221; said Pangelinan. Some voters however were<a href="https://www.guampdn.com/news/some-motor-voters-confused-by-registration-changes/article_e59b2a6c-2821-11ed-850a-53aacf608b2a.html"> turned away from long-time polling sites</a> on after being told they were in the wrong place because they participated in motor voter registration. Voters much vote where they live, not receive mail and that caused problems for some. “We were experiencing a lot of that. I want to say at least 12 people,” said David Sumagaysay, leader for Precinct 2A for Asan-Maina, on the primary election night. About 237 ballots were cast in that precinct, roughly half of the registered voters. Barry Flores, 67, said he lives in Talo’fo’fo, but he prefers to vote in Hagåtña, so he has<a href="https://www.guampdn.com/news/residents-eager-to-vote-in-guams-primary-election/article_5b34b4ce-25ce-11ed-8ad0-3fd1ea6a3f76.html"> not updated his registration</a>. “It’s a good location because not a lot of people come to Hagåtña, so I like it,” said Flores. By law, voters should be registered in the village where they reside. He said voting the day of the primary, instead of early voting, is part of his election routine. “I’m so accustomed to doing it this way,” he said. Another issue GEC officials<a href="https://www.postguam.com/news/local/gec-tables-primary-election-concerns-to-prepare-machines-for-ballot-counts/article_c617e85c-25ff-11ed-8777-fb691ff40c73.html"> saw as a challenge</a> was early voting offered this election. “Because of this new early voting situation there may be cases where some of the early ballots were put in the wrong precinct box,” Camacho said. While tabulators did not dismiss the ballots, GEC legal counsel Vincent Camacho said the report would need to be reconciled so the ballots tabulated are equal to votes by precinct. The concerns were tabled to allow officials to zero out the tabulation machines as precincts began rolling in.</p>

Commissioners voted 6-0 to ask state lawmakers to approve the proposal to create an Elections Inspector General program, which would cost about $1.3 million in the next two-year state budget and include 10 full-time staff members. Commission administrator Meagan Wolfe said the state commission needs more resources to respond to inquiries from the public that have ballooned since the 2020 election, when the commission became a target of Trump and supporters who believed his false claims of widespread voter fraud. &#8220;This office would not be about dwelling in the past or giving credence to claims that threaten the credibility of Wisconsin’s accurate and secure elections,&#8221; Wolfe said. In the proposal, WEC staff said &#8220;warding off attempts of electoral manipulation — both real and perceived — remains the highest priority of the WEC. It must be in order to instill public confidence in Wisconsin’s elections system and to ensure election integrity.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6021" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NHWelcome-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NHWelcome-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NHWelcome-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NHWelcome.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Language Access</strong>: For the first, elections materials at the New Hampshire secretary of state’s office will be<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2022-08-30/for-the-first-time-new-hampshire-voters-can-access-information-in-three-other-languages-from-nh-secretary-of-state"> available in Spanish, French, Mandarin in addition to English</a>. Information on voter registration, what type of identification to bring to the polls and how to fill out a ballot can now be found in Spanish, French and Mandarin on the secretary of state&#8217;s website. Official ballots are still only available in English. Secretary of State Dave Scanlan said requests from language advocates and an increasingly diverse population spurred the office to translate its voter materials. There was an effort this past legislative session to require the Secretary of State’s office to do so, but it did not move forward in the legislature. Unlike other states or jurisdictions, New Hampshire has not been federally required to provide election information in other languages, and state election officials have in the past resisted efforts to publish multilingual voter information in the absence of a federal mandate. Eva Castillo, who leads the New Hampshire Alliance of Immigrants and Refugees told NHPR, with New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary status consistently under discussion, voter information available in more than just English is important. “We need to really become a microcosm of what the rest of the country is, regardless of how many numbers we have. We have to make voting accessible for every single voting citizen in the state,” she said. Scanlan said that he hadn’t thought of that as a reason to make the case to keep the state’s first-in-the-nation status but “it does reflect growth of minority populations that may need assistance in voting. We want to treat voters as equally as possible in the state.” The secretary of state’s office says these materials will be available at the polls, and they will survey local election officials after the midterms to hear how it went with voters. Scanlan said other languages could be added in the future.</p>

The Legislature voted to expand the state law even more to include all employees of a federal, state or local government agency — most notably election workers and code enforcement officers, who have both reported an increase in violent threats in recent years. The bill would let those workers use a substitute address on public records, including the voter registration file. “It’s probably another manifestation of polarization,” said state Sen. Josh Newman, a Democrat from Fullerton and the bill’s author. “Nobody really envisioned a time where you would have to protect so many public workers.” The bill now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who must decide by the end of September whether to sign the bill into law. It would not apply to state lawmakers or other elected officials, according to Newman’s office.</p>

Taxpayers recently spent approximately $450,000 to do just that after former county prosecutor Justin Kollar left the office vacant more than three years before his third term was set to end in 2024. A special primary election was held in December, followed by a special general election in February — requirements baked into the county charter. Now voters will get the chance to decide if the deputy prosecutor in such a situation should simply assume the office of prosecutor until the seat is filled in the next regularly scheduled election. “That’s why we have deputies to back up the person in charge,” said Charter Review Commission Vice Chairman Jan TenBruggencate. “It’s disruptive to have an election in the middle of the year when, if you just wait a few months, there will be one anyway.”</p>

Organizers collected enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, according to the state&#8217;s Bureau of Elections. But canvassers debated how to handle a challenge to the proposal alleging that the petition form circulated by organizers failed to note which sections of the Michigan Constitution would be impacted if the proposal was placed on the ballot and adopted by voters. The Board of State Canvassers reached an impasse on a motion to adopt the recommendation handed down from the Bureau of Elections to certify the Promote the Vote proposal. The two Republican members of the Board of State Canvassers voted against placing Promote the Vote on this fall&#8217;s ballot while the two Democratic members voted in favor of putting it on the ballot. The vote leaves the Promote the Vote proposal off the ballot for now. Promote the Vote immediately vowed to go to court and expressed confidence that the proposal will ultimately secure a spot on the ballot.</p>

The proposed legislation, which is just entering the draft phase, wouldn’t be retroactive, so any county that chooses not to rely on machines this year wouldn’t have to return money if the legislation is enacted into law next year. “At this moment in time, there would not be a county that would actually fall under having to return the funds to the state,” said Democratic Assemblywoman Brittney Miller, the committee’s chair. While the proposal advanced unanimously, several Republicans warned they wouldn’t vote on the measure during the next legislative session if the bill becomes retroactive.</p>

It&#8217;s going to be very contentious. And I do have some concern that the most likely person who will be our next chief elections officer, secretary of state, has alleged that there may be nefarious activities at the ballot box in Wyoming, which I don&#8217;t agree exists,&#8221; Cheyenne Republican Dan Zwonitzer said, introducing the motion. &#8220;I think our elections are safe and secure, probably more than any other state&#8217;s in the country,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And so I&#8217;m concerned, based on some of the rhetoric and the mailers I saw in regards to our most likely incoming secretary of state, that we may be in a precarious position when it comes to election administration for the next four years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee also approved drafting separating bills that would establish open or<a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2022/08/25/wyoming-legislature-considering-open-primaries-ranked-choice-voting-elections/"> “jungle” primary elections</a> and a pilot program for<a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2022/08/25/wyoming-legislature-considering-open-primaries-ranked-choice-voting-elections/"> ranked choice voting elections</a> in Wyoming. Open primary elections would involve the top-four candidates moving forward from the primary election to the general. Ranked choice would be tested in nonpartisan, municipal elections in Wyoming, modeling a program currently being used in Utah.   An open primary removes individual party primaries with all political candidates from every party on the same ballot. The top vote-getters move on to the general election. The committee decided that Wyoming’s open primary, if initiated, would emulate the open primary currently used in Alaska.</p>

The civil suit, filed in Cullman County Circuit Court this week against probate judge Tammy Brown, seeks the release of local Cast Vote Records (CVR) data to the plaintiff, Sheila Haynes, under the Alabama Public Records statute. The complaint accuses the probate office of failing to deliver the data on a request from Haynes earlier this year, having informed her through the county attorney that the electronic information isn’t retained in the regular course of business and thus isn’t subject to the statute. The suit claims that the probate office has “refused” to give Haynes access to the data “in a timely manner,” with the legally-required 22-month window for retaining the information after the Nov. 3, 2020 election set to expire on Sept. 3. In a statement to The Times, Brown said Friday that her office had followed guidance from Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill in addressing Haynes’ request. “We accommodated her request to the extent possible by providing her with public election information,” said Brown. “During the time of her requests, Alabama probate judges, sheriffs, absentee manager and Board of Registrars received information from the Alabama secretary of state notifying each of this specific public record request being made to various county offices throughout the State of Alabama and to only provide per a court order,” the statement continued. “After further review, Cast Vote Records [CVRs] are not public record and cannot be produced per request without a court order which the probate office never received.”</p>

The high court decision upholds a lower court ruling issued hours earlier, in which Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Joseph Mikitish rejected thousands of signatures and said the initiative fell 1,458 signatures short of the 238,000 required to qualify for the ballot. The judge’s Friday ruling reversed his own decision from a day earlier after the Supreme Court asked him to explain how he concluded that the initiative had enough valid signatures to qualify.  The Supreme Court’s ruling is the last word in a weeks-long battle between initiative backers and opponents. Critics, led by the Arizona Free Enterprise Club, succeeded in knocking off enough qualifying signatures for the measure to barely fail. Chief Justice Robert Brutinel, in a brief order, simply upheld the revised ruling and kept the initiative off the ballot. When the judge upheld the measure the day before, Brutinel had refused to accept it, saying court was unable to determine exactly how Mikitish came to his determination that backers had collected enough valid signatures for the measure to appear on November’s ballot.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John Tuchi dismissed a suit seeking to<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/arizona-gop-candidates-lose-bid-to-ban-exploitable-voting-machines/"> ban electronic voting machines</a> ahead of the November midterm election, brought by Republican candidates who claim the machines may have security flaws. In the<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/arizona-gop-candidates-sue-to-block-the-use-of-voting-machines-in-the-upcoming-midterm-election/"> suit</a>, Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem claimed an injunction to stop the use of voting machines was necessary since the &#8220;voting system does not reliably provide trustworthy and verifiable election results.&#8221; Former President Donald Trump — a frequent purveyor of baseless election fraud claims — has endorsed Lake and Finchem in their respective races. Lake and Finchem claimed that voting on paper ballots and hand-counting those votes was the only efficient and secure method for proceeding in November. Tuchi on Friday found the supposed evidence conjectural and not concrete. “Ultimately, even upon drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs’ favor, the court finds that their claimed injuries are indeed too speculative to establish an injury in fact, and therefore standing,” wrote Tuchi. Tuchi wrote that in previous election fraud cases, courts have ruled in favor of the plaintiffs when actual fraud had occurred. In Curling v. Kemp, Georgia voting machines had been hacked and the secretary of state refused to act. Tuchi said the plaintiff’s case is nothing like that case. “Here, as the secretary points out, a long chain of hypothetical contingencies must take place for any harm to occur— (1) the specific voting equipment used in Arizona must have “security failures” that allow a malicious actor to manipulate vote totals; (2) such an actor must actually manipulate an election; (3) Arizona’s specific procedural safeguards must fail to detect the manipulation; and (4) the manipulation must change the outcome of the election,” Tuchi wrote.</p>

In return for dropping more significant charges against her, Knisley has agreed to assist prosecutors. “There was some specific information she provided to us that was very valuable,” said Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein as part of his reasoning for the court to accept the plea deal. The judge granted prosecutors’ request to sentence Knisley to two years of unsupervised probation, as long as she continues to cooperate with the investigators building a case against Peters and former Mesa County Elections Manager Sandra Brown. He also ordered her to perform 150 hours of community service. Her conviction will prevent her ever working or volunteering in elections administration again.</p>
<p>A Republican candidate for the Colorado House has filed a complaint against the Boulder County Clerk and Recorder’s Office, arguing that the county<a href="https://www.coloradodaily.com/2022/08/30/house-district-10-candidate-sues-boulder-county-clerk-and-recorders-office/"> has not been adequately monitoring its remote drop boxes</a>. Bill DeOreo said he became concerned about some of the county’s ballot drop boxes when participating in a Boulder County election office tour in June. To monitor the drop boxes, there must be proper lighting and video surveillance. The camera was too far away and poorly lit, and it could not visualize either the face of the user nor what was being inserted in the box, the complaint argues. DeOreo, who is currently representing himself, said he is hopeful a judge will require the county to bring its drop boxes into compliance. In response to a records request submitted by DeOreo, which was included in the complaint he filed, Clerk and Recorder Molly Fitzpatrick defended her office’s practices. “Colorado law requires that all drop boxes be kept under 24-hour video surveillance with adequate lighting and that boxes are emptied by a bipartisan team who maintain a chain of custody log when transporting ballots between drop boxes and our ballot processing center,” she wrote. “I believe we are in compliance with these requirements.”</p>

The lawsuit, filed in federal court, is seeking<a href="https://www.fox32chicago.com/election/chicago-mayoral-candidate-willie-wilson-files-lawsuit-to-stop-closure-of-voting-precincts"> an injunction to stop the board from eliminating 121 neighborhood polling places</a>. &#8220;For them to do this here is moving time back to the Jim Crow  days,&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;We filed this lawsuit because it&#8217;s violating people&#8217;s civil rights.&#8221; The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners decided this summer to eliminate 779 voter precincts, which will actually shut down 121 separate polling places, said a board spokesman. That&#8217;s because a half-dozen or more precincts have typically been sharing a single voting location. Wilson said the closures violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He said he&#8217;s worried most about senior citizens — the age group most likely to vote — not knowing where to vote. &#8220;They live off a fixed income. For them to move the poll, let’s say a mile away or five or six blocks, has been unfair to our number one voters, alright. In the whole city of Chicago, and Cook County, state of Illinois and around this country. I think it&#8217;s wrong,&#8221; Wilson said. A spokesman for the elections board said increasing numbers now vote by mail or vote early at locations in all 50 wards and downtown, reducing the volume of those casting ballots on election day itself.</p>

The suit, filed without an attorney by Katie Roberts and Hannah Mingucci Aug. 4, sought a temporary injunction that would prevent county election officials from destroying ballots, computer equipment and other records after September 4. The two plaintiffs said they spoke for many others in their skepticism about the 2020 election results. Their suit, which they said was filed independently of Sheriff Hayden, did not ask that anything be done with the records, only that they be preserved. Vano concluded Roberts and Mingucci did not have standing to sue, noting they did not have sufficient claim of harm or injury if the records were destroyed.</p>

Zalla dismissed ballot integrity allegations in the recount petition of Jessica Neal, who posted a $57,368 bond to initiate the Aug. 10 hand recount of ballots in her loss to Shelley &#8220;Funke&#8221; Frommeyer. The report that recount chairman Jack Porter submitted to the court indicated there was no change in the vote totals for each candidate, with Frommeyer receiving 4,094 votes and Neal receiving 3,787. Despite the outcome of the recount, Neal had filed a motion to set those results aside due to alleged ballot integrity concerns, citing that only a portion of voting machines containing ballots from Campbell County had yellow security seals at the top of the equipment. She also claimed Porter did not enforce recount procedures uniformly. Zalla dismissed Neal&#8217;s concerns and concurred with testimony from Campbell County Clerk Jim Leursen that yellow seals at the top of the machines were optional and not required by state law, as the required blue seals at the bottom of the machines — where the ballots are actually contained — were all properly secured. Zalla&#8217;s order stated that while Neal had &#8220;offered some conjecture about ballot security,&#8221; she had &#8220;not offered even the slightest amount of evidence concerning such ballot security, ballot tampering, ballot handling re: negligence/fraud, compromise of the chain of custody of the voting machines and ballots, voting tapes, or flawed recount procedures.&#8221;</p>

Republican Party Chairman James Lyons and a handful of Republican candidates or party officials filed a lawsuit in June seeking to overturn the so-called VOTES Act, which made voting-by-mail and early voting permanent in Massachusetts. The plaintiffs argued before the SJC in early July that the law, which codified pandemic-era policies that proved popular with voters, violated the allowances for absentee voting contained in Article 105 of the state Constitution and that Secretary of State William Galvin should have been blocked from sending mail-in ballot applications out. The court quickly ruled in favor of Galvin on all claims on July 11 but said time pressures meant that a detailed reasoning for its decision to allow mail-in voting to proceed would have to follow in due time. As of Friday, about 250,000 people had requested, filled out and returned mail-in ballots for the Sept. 6 state primaries, Galvin’s office said. Lyons and the GOP pointed to part of the Massachusetts Constitution that explicitly allows for absentee voting for three reasons. “We disagree,” Justice Scott Kafker wrote for the court in a 61-page opinion released this week. “Voting is a fundamental right, and nothing in art. 45, as amended by art. 105, or in other parts of the Constitution cited by the plaintiffs, prohibits the Legislature, which has plenary constitutional powers, including broad powers to regulate the process of elections and even broader powers with respect to primaries, from enhancing voting opportunities. This is particularly true with respect to the universal early voting provisions in the VOTES act, which, in stark contrast to the narrow and discrete absentee-voting provisions of art. 45, enhance voting opportunities equally for all voters.”</p>

Daniel Richard of Auburn also sued his hometown and Town Administrator Daniel Goonan for refusing to let him cast a vote by paper ballot and have it hand-counted. In a motion filed Wednesday, Richard asked a Rockingham County Superior Court judge to issue an injunction to stop towns from using the machines for the Sept. 13 primary. He asked to be allowed to make an in-court argument on the topic before voters go to the polls. A Rockingham County Superior Court judge has agreed to hear arguments on Richard&#8217;s suit Sept. 9, four days before the primary. The six-count suit asks the court to either outlaw the machines or, at the very least, permit anyone to cast a paper ballot and have it counted by hand in any city or town. Michael Garrity, communications director for Attorney General John Formella, said the state has received Richard&#8217;s lawsuit. &#8220;At this point, what I can tell you is that we are reviewing the filed complaint,&#8221; Garrity said in a statement.</p>

Republicans allege that Mercer County was in violation of the state’s Ballot Cure Act after they refused to respond to public document requests for the 2021 general election and the 2022 primary.   The relatively new law permits voters to remediate their vote-by-mail ballots if they were rejected for a technical deficiency, such as a signature that does not match one on file. A court hearing had initially been set for September 27, but Mercer County Counsel Paul Adezio asked for more time.</p>

O&#8217;Donnell made his determination against Maras on Friday, a day after an hours long protest hearing on challenges to dozens of the signatures that had qualified her for the ballot last month, as well her decision to become an independent after failing to make the ballot as a Republican. O’Donnell determined that 18 of 35 challenged signatures were invalid, enough to take Maras below the 5,000 required. O’Donnell’s recommendation goes back to Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office for a final ruling. O’Donnell had been selected to hear the case because LaRose is Maras’ would-be opponent, a LaRose spokesperson said. A LaRose deputy has been handling decision related to her candidacy for the same reason. Maras vowed to appeal, if the recommendation is upheld.</p>

Local<a href="https://myrgv.com/free/2022/08/25/former-mayor-found-not-guilty-of-voter-fraud-on-all-counts/"> news</a><a href="https://www.krgv.com/news/former-edinburg-mayor-richard-molina-found-not-guilty-in-voter-fraud-trial"> outlets</a> reported Molina was acquitted of 12 counts, including one count of engaging in organized voter fraud and 11 counts of illegal voting. His high-profile arrest by the state’s election fraud unit in 2019 was announced by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton as part of what Paxton described as “an organized illegal voting scheme” in the November 2017 municipal election. The case was prosecuted by the Hidalgo County District Attorney’s Office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to a 2019 news release from the attorney general’s office, Molina was accused of directing voters to change their addresses to places where they did not live — including an apartment complex owned by Molina — so they could vote for him. Molina won the election by 1,240 votes, unseating then-incumbent Mayor Richard Garcia in the South Texas town.</p>

Peterson has ruled that Wisconsin<a href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/federal-judge-disabled-wisconsin-voters-can-receive-help-voting/"> voters with disabilities can get help with returning their ballots</a>. Peterson issued his order ahead of the November 2022 election saying that voters who have difficulty returning their own ballot can choose someone to do so for them. The order comes after the state Supreme Court in July issued a ruling that outlawed absentee ballot drop boxes and said that voters must return their own absentee ballot in person to a clerk&#8217;s office or other designated site. The decision did not explicitly address voter assistance for returning ballots by mail, but Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe subsequently pointed to a state law that says a voter must mail their own ballot. Peterson cited the federal Voting Rights Act. Federal law generally takes precedence over state laws under the U.S. Constitution&#8217;s supremacy clause. &#8220;Voters shouldn&#8217;t have to choose between exercising their federal rights and complying with state law,&#8221; Peterson wrote in the final ruling in a lawsuit filed by four people in Wisconsin with disabilities. Peterson&#8217;s order gives the elections commission until Sept. 9 to notify all of the state&#8217;s more than 1,800 municipal clerks of the rights disabled voters have to receive assistance under the Voting Rights Act. &#8220;This is a victory for voting rights in Wisconsin, and I think it sends a clear message across the country that federal law protects voters with disabilities,&#8221; said Scott Thompson, attorney for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Two Wisconsin judges<a href="https://journaltimes.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/judges-dismiss-2-lawsuits-after-michael-gablemans-subpoenas-are-withdrawn/article_e3481ad2-dbd0-5dd2-9ec9-272bab6a2e87.html"> dismissed a pair of lawsuits contesting subpoenas</a> issued last year by former state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman as part of the now-closed GOP review of the state’s 2020 election. Both cases related to subpoenas that were withdrawn Friday by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who earlier this month fired Gableman and closed the Office of Special Counsel that has cost Wisconsin taxpayers more than $1 million and has failed to provide any evidence to support some Republicans’ claims of widespread fraud in the presidential election. In a brief order, Waukesha County Circuit Judge Ralph Ramirez dismissed a case brought by Gableman after officials in Wisconsin’s five largest cities refused to sit for private, in-person meetings with him as part of the review. Dane County Circuit Judge Rhonda Lanford dismissed a separate lawsuit brought by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul challenging Gableman’s authority to demand a similar meeting with Wisconsin Elections Commission administrator Meagan Wolfe. Kaul had argued that demanding private interviews is illegal.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://civicnation-org.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZAofuqqrD8pE9cLVyp-hSQmZ3aSsnM3AjIZ#/registration">College Student Poll Worker Recruitment</a>: In 2020, thousands of college students answered the call to serve as poll workers. This year, local election officials around the country still need more poll workers, especially tech-savvy, multi-lingual young people. Join ALL IN and the Students Learn Students Vote Coalition (SLSV) for a 30-minute webinar to learn about ideas and strategies to recruit college students at your institution to serve as poll workers, which are often paid positions, and additional benefits from establishing and maintaining a relationship with your local election officials. <strong>When:</strong> 4pm Eastern Sept. 13. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/">National Voter Registration Day</a>: National Voter Registration Day is a nonpartisan civic holiday celebrating our democracy. First observed in 2012, it has quickly gained momentum ever since. Nearly 4.7 million voters have registered to vote on the holiday to date. Celebrated every September, National Voter Registration Day involves volunteers and organizations from all over the country hitting the streets in a single day of coordinated field, technology and media efforts. National Voter Registration Day seeks to create broad awareness of voter registration opportunities to reach tens of thousands of voters who may not register otherwise. According to U.S. Census data from 2020, as many as 1 in 4 eligible Americans are not registered to vote. Every year, millions of Americans find themselves unable to vote because they miss a registration deadline, don’t update their registration, or aren’t sure how to register. National Voter Registration Day wants to make sure everyone has the opportunity to vote. The holiday has been endorsed by the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED), the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and the National Association of Election Officials (The Election Center). <strong>When:</strong> September 20</p>
<p><a href="https://ucla.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_YAvPjQc-S3qWUjGokT7wUw">Special From the Frontlines:  The United States Supreme Court and American Democracy: View of Three Journalists</a>: The Safeguarding Democracy Project promotes research, collaboration, and advocacy under the leadership of UCLA Law Professor Richard L. Hasen; one of the nation&#8217;s leading election scholars. The Safeguarding Democracy Project is built upon the premise that tackling issues of the U.S. election integrity must be collaborative: across ideologies, across scholarly disciplines, and as a bridge between theory and practice. Moderated by Richard L. Hasen and featuring Joan Biskupic, Adam Liptak and Dahlia Lithwick. <strong>When:</strong> September 20, 12pm Pacific. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://voteearlyday.org/">Vote Early Day</a>: Vote Early Day is a nonpartisan movement of media companies, businesses, nonprofits, election administrators, and creatives working to ensure all Americans have the tools to vote early. This holiday is a tentpole moment for partners of all stripes to engage with voters and urge them to cast their ballots. Created in 2020, Vote Early Day has brought thousands of national and local partners together in celebration and activation to increase the number of people voting early. This collaborative, open-source model—similar to Giving Tuesday and National Voter Registration Day—ensures that millions more Americans take advantage of their options to vote early through on the ground activations, get-out-the-vote pushes, national communications on traditional and social media, and efforts to create a new culture around voting. Vote Early Day plays a unique role in the push to get voters to cast their ballot. We are a trusted, nonpartisan holiday with supporters on both sides of the aisle. We provide a central moment for a wide range of partners (many non- traditional to the civic space) to engage with voters and urge them to vote early. Our collaboration of thousands of diverse partners allows us to engage in places beyond where voters are used to seeing election messages. This allows us to break through the noise and meet voters where they are. <strong>When:</strong> October 28</p>
