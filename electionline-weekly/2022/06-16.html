							<h2>In Focus This week</h2>
														<p><strong>Two years later, elections officials still facing ‘unprecedented’ situations</strong><br />
<em>From paper shortages to rising costs elections officials grappling with another new normal</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>No one expects a global pandemic. No one expects a paper shortage. No one expects $5+ for a gallon of gas. No one expects the Spanish Inquisition.</p>
<p>But in the past few years, that’s just what elections officials have been faced with. After an “unprecedented” 2020 which basically saw the entire election administration paradigm shift, this year elections officials are grappling with rising costs, paper shortages and a portion of the electorate that is, at best, skeptical of the democratic process.</p>
<p>“…[T]his year’s federal election presents a new challenge: the supply chain backlog that has and will continue to affect paper supplies across the country,”<a href="https://www.rules.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Testimony_Ardoin.pdf"> testified</a><a href="https://www.sos.la.gov/Pages/default.aspx"> Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin</a> before the Senate Rules &amp; Administration Committee at a<a href="https://www.rules.senate.gov/hearings/administration-of-upcoming-elections"> hearing</a> on May 19. “Let me be clear: This is a crisis that demands immediate attention and bipartisan action. IT is not an exaggeration to say that if this situation is not handled, it could lead to a serious erosion in the confidence in our elections.”</p>
<p><strong>Paper Shortages<br />
</strong>Wake County, North Carolina is one of the fastest growing counties in the country. It currently makes up 11% of registered voters in the state. The county is also a 100% pre-printed paper ballot county so there is always a lot of paper in the county elections’ storage areas.</p>
<div id="attachment_8489" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8489" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-8489" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PaperSupply-300x227.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="227" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PaperSupply-300x227.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PaperSupply-768x582.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PaperSupply.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8489" class="wp-caption-text">Stack of blank paper</p></div>
<p>However this year, there’s even more than normal, because like most elections officials, Gary Sims, executive director of the<a href="https://www.wakegov.com/departments-government/board-elections"> Wake County board of elections</a>, is a planner and he was ready for 2022’s unknown unknown.</p>
<p>“We have always kept 1-2 elections worth of paper stock in our arsenal by pre-ordering paper to hold for the printer,” said Gary Sims, director of elections in Wake County. “With the unknown variable of a 2nd Primary, we had pre-ordered 2.5 elections worth of paper stock before warning signs went off about a paper shortage.  Once we started hearing about paper shortages, we ordered enough to fully cover us through the November 2022 General as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a>’s Tammy Patrick recently presented a PowerPoint presentation at the State Certification Testing of Voting Systems National Conference with a <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Tammy-Patrick-Paper-Checklist-State-Cert-2022.pptx">Checklist for Paper Supply Shortages</a>.</p>
<p>Patrick stressed that unless you have the paper supply in-hand, simply having it on order is not enough.</p>
<p>“I have heard some say this doesn’t apply to them—that they got their orders in really early,” Patrick said in her presentation. “I am here to say that unless you have the product you need in hand, you need to verify!”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8490" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PaperSupply2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PaperSupply2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PaperSupply2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PaperSupply2.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/"> Bipartisan Policy Center</a> recently released<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/ballot-paper-shortages/"> Preparing for Ballot Paper Shortages in 2022 and 2024</a>. The report outlines three challenges for election administration created by the global paper shortage: supply, timing, and cost. Within each category, the task force offers actionable recommendations for election officials and policymakers on how to administer secure elections amid supply chain disruptions both in 2022 and future elections.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.eac.gov/"> U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> has provided a<a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/supply-chain-considerations-election-officials"> Supply Chain Considerations for Election Officials</a> document that includes resources to specifically address the paper supply chain issues.</p>
<p>Vote-by-mail Colorado has its primary on June 28 and<a href="https://www.bouldercounty.org/elections/"> Boulder County</a> Clerk Molly Fitzpatrick said the county was fortunately able to avoid any paper shortages due to planning ahead.</p>
<p>“We were able to secure all paper products needed for this election,” Fitzpatrick said. “However, we were asked by our print vendor earlier than usual (in December) for our estimated quantities needed (for the June primary) because they wanted to order earlier than usual to ensure they had enough for us. Our print vendor has asked us for our estimated quantities earlier than usual for the November election.”</p>
<p>Cathy Darling Allen, the<a href="https://www.elections.co.shasta.ca.us/"> Shasta County, California</a> clerk/registrar of voters echoed Fitzpatrick’s comments about earlier planning for November is a necessity this year.</p>
<p>“We have already been contacted by our ballot and envelope printer regarding supply chain issues, and so we are confident that we will be able to print and mail ballots for November’s election,” Darling Allen said. “However, because of these issues, we have done that many months in advance of a normal election – so the vendors are asking their customers (us local election officials) to place orders earlier than normal.”</p>
<p><strong>The Impacts of Inflation<br />
</strong>According to Fitzpatrick in Colorado, they have yet needed to make any budget accommodations to account for rising costs, but she said that it is something they are actively looking at and keeping an eye on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8491" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/rising-prices-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/rising-prices-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/rising-prices-768x432.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/rising-prices.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Shasta County, California’s Darling Allen said she’s still in a wait-and-see pattern with rising costs. She noted that invoices for the June primary are still coming in so any adjustments her office may need to make for November are yet to be determined.</p>
<p>She did note that labor expenses—salaries and healthcare—have gone up and that obviously affects the bottom line.</p>
<p>One cost that has gone up in Shasta County is the cost of dealing with a portion of the electorate that is distrustful of the system.</p>
<p>“We are also experiencing a dramatic increase in observation and PRAs [public records requests] that we have not carefully analyzed yet, but we know there are financial impacts to diverting staff to attend to observers instead of performing their regular election duties,” Darling said. “Same is true for the exponential increase in PRAs regarding the November 2020 election.”</p>
<p>In Wake County, Sims said that it’s not just the elections division that has had to make adjustments for rising costs, but all county departments.</p>
<p>“The county did as a whole, not just elections,” Sims said. “Contract amendments have had to been made to accommodate fuel surcharges. This language has also been added to the FY’23 contracts for surcharges based on official resources such as the<a href="https://www.eia.gov/"> Energy Information Administration</a>.”</p>
<p>Sims noted that the paper shortage doesn’t just affect ballots. Even with online voter registration and e-poll books there is A LOT of paper used in an elections office.</p>
<p>“Costs have gone up for pretty much most services. We print paper pollbooks. Our delivery service for Early Voting and Election Day sites has forced service fee increases.  Even the paper stock used to mail voter cards have gone up,” Sims said. “On top of all of this, contractors and vendors have had staff shortages.  We have in some cases had to resort to having to split orders between vendors just to make sure at least one has time to make the deliveries with unknown supply chain delays.”</p>
<p>Ultimately though, regardless of shortages and rising costs, officials are confident the 2022 election will run smoothly and be fair and secure. Like 2020, it might just take some thinking outside of the box, which elections officials are pretty great at doing.</p>
<p>“As with any county election office no matter how large or small your jurisdiction, failure is not an option. With delays on shipping and product delivery, you may want to seek out alternate vendors beyond who you normally order with.” Sims said, adding that elections officials should consider partnering with other county departments for resource sharing.”</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Four more states finish primary voting</strong><br />
<em>Voters in ME, NV, ND &amp; SC hit the polls and mailboxes this week</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8343" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022Elections.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />The theme of light voter turnout continued with four primaries this week in Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina. While not historically low, turn was lower than it had been in 2018 in many places.</p>
<p>On a positive note, low voter turnout also means fewer problems at the polls and on election night Tuesday was no different although there were some isolated issues. Also, there were no reports of blurry barcodes this week.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at what did and didn’t happen on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8487" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MaineWelcome-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MaineWelcome-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MaineWelcome-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MaineWelcome.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Maine</strong>: In advance of Tuesday’s primary, just over 32,000<a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2022/06/14/politics/maine-sees-a-low-turnout-tuesday-primary-election/"> absentee ballot requests</a> as of Monday afternoon with about three-fourths returned so far. That is far lower than the competitive 2018 primaries, when 36,000 ballots were requested ahead of time.<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/light-turnout-reported-voters-across-163300831.html"> Primary day voting turnout was also light</a>. After visiting polling stations in southern Maine, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said turnout appeared to be low, which she attributed to the absence of contested primaries for governor. Bellows expected higher turnout in the northern part of the state because of the 2nd Congressional District Republican primary. &#8220;Turnout is very light,&#8221; Bellows said while visiting polling places late Tuesday morning. &#8220;Of course, we would expect to see turnout lighter in southern Maine than in northern Maine, given there are no top-of-the ticket primaries, but it&#8217;s still seemingly remarkably low as of this morning.&#8221; Bellows said her office has not received reports of any issues at the polls. While disappointed that more people weren&#8217;t voting, she said the low turnout election is a good practice run for newly hired clerks, ahead of the fall elections. &#8220;We anticipate that November will be a very high turnout election given that you have two statewide leaders facing off against each other in the gubernatorial (election),&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have seen some turnover of clerks across the state, so some of our clerks are running an election for the first time. This is a great way for them to go through the entire process step by step before November.&#8221; A handful of races had to rely on ranked choice voting for the final result including a<a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2022/06/14/portland-voters-choose-three-new-school-board-members-in-special-election/"> school board races</a> and a Waterville-area GOP<a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2022/06/15/politics/senate-district-16-gop-primary-instant-runoff/"> state senate primary</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5617" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NV-Welcome-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NV-Welcome-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NV-Welcome-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NV-Welcome.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Nevada</strong>: The biggest news coming out of the Silver State on Tuesday was the Republican nomination for<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/15/1104965309/nevada-secretary-of-state-election-results"> secretary of state</a>. Jim Marchant, a former lawmaker who based his campaign around baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election won the Republican nomination. Marchant, who beat off three other challengers, will face Democrat Francisco Aguilar in November. There were some administration headlines on Tuesday too. A polling place in<a href="https://www.kolotv.com/2022/06/14/nevada-primary-card-reader-issue-reported-cold-springs-ms/"> Washoe County</a> experienced problems with card readers, but voting was not affected, just a bit slower. Also in Washoe County, several voters discovered that their party affiliation had been switched to unaffiliate. amie Rodriguez, government affairs manager for the county, said that the<a href="https://www.kolotv.com/2022/06/15/voters-discover-party-affiliation-changed-other-primary-election-day/"> issue stems from Nevada’s automatic voter registration</a>. When you register your car or get a new driver’s license, you now have an automatic voter registration. Rodriguez said if you don’t completely fill out the form, it will default to ‘other’. “For example, if you are a registered Republican, you’ve been a registered Republican, and you think ‘I don’t want to make any updates.’ What we’re finding is people are not clicking that they want to continue to be a Republican,” Rodriguez said. The Registrar of Voters receives what appears to be a blank registration. Rodriguez said, in these instances, mailers are sent asking you to update your political party preference. If you do not check the party affiliation you want and send the mailer back, your party affiliation is not updated. It was smooth sailing in<a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/thousands-of-nevadans-hit-the-polls-for-election-day-2022"> Clark County</a> where Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria aid voters shouldn’t be concerned about voter fraud, and he’s confident in their process to count ballots.<a href="https://pvtimes.com/uncategorized/election-error-11-ballots-omit-incumbent-nye-county-commissioners-name-110777/"> Nye County</a> discovered that 11 ballots didn’t feature a candidate’s name for county commissioner. By the time the error was discovered, six of the 11 ballots had been cast.</p>

A<a href="https://www.kvrr.com/2022/06/14/voters-fill-up-polls-on-primary-election-day/"> Cass County</a> election worker says the crowds came in waves throughout the day. Long lines at the end of the of the voting day in Cass meant<a href="https://kfgo.com/2022/06/15/599392/"> some polls remained open late</a> and therefore delayed the reporting of results.  “We’ve been really steady. We’ll get a bunch then we’ll get a little bit of lag then a few more then a little lag. We’ve been open since 7 so we get about doing 200 an hour,” Cass County Election Inspector Ron Anderson said. In<a href="https://www.kfyrtv.com/2022/06/14/voters-come-out-june-election-north-dakota/"> Burleigh County</a>, Election Inspector Duane Friedig said voters arrived in small waves. “The turnout has been quite slow. We are hoping for more people to walk through the door,” he said. Voters in Burleigh County were trying out new equipment this election and seemed to like the process. “I voted the automated system for the first time. Very enjoyable. Very easy,” said Msgr.

New Mexico Secretary of State spokesman Alex Curtas said that the Otero County Commission did not follow any current legal protocols. &#8220;We are evaluating our next steps on the Otero commission’s vote today regarding the hand counting of ballots, but there is no current legal protocol for such measures outside the post-election audit,&#8221; Curtas said. Curtas said there is no indication that the primary as conducted with anything less than the highest standards of election administration. &#8220;The commission is doing an extreme disservice to the voters of Otero County and candidates seeking to have their names on the General Election ballot by refusing to certify the results of the 2022 Primary Election and they’ve done this without any indication that the results were in question and over the objections of the Otero County Clerk.&#8221; The office of New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver sued the county on Tuesday (see Legal Updates). </span><em>The Associated Press</em> has an article about how this move by Otero County<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-biden-new-mexico-voting-machines-7b91e326d2f378898046ec7df779ba20"> may affect election certification nationwide in coming elections</a>.</p>

JEARP is an e-journal designed to address the concerns of the practice, policy, research, vendor, and advocacy communities involved in the administration of elections in the US and abroad. It is a peer-reviewed praxis journal that provides greater breadth and depth to questions about the administration of elections and designed to foment informed discussion among the practitioner, policy, vendor, advocate, and research communities. Readers will find pieces on policy and practice, reflections from practitioners, current research with commentary on the research by election officials, and reviews of relevant books and services. Practitioner authors in our inaugural issue take on topics related to critical infrastructure and the elections workforce, policy changes related to voting at home, ethics and the future of public service, and the impact of the experiences from the 2020 election moving forward. Research featured in this issue focuses on postal voting in the 2020 election, electoral management in Canada and public perceptions, and citizen attitudes and the relationship to election administration. We also include reviews of a recent book on voter registration, the role of philanthropy in elections, and the Election Official Legal Defense Network. JEARP editorial team members include Mitchell Brown (Professor, Auburn University), Kathleen Hale (Professor, Auburn University), David Stafford (Supervisor of Elections, Escambia County, FL), Terri Stroud (General Counsel, District of Columbia Board of Elections) and Ryan Williamson (Assistant Professor, Auburn University).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

The report and framework features exclusive data on the barriers that prevent youth under age 30 from participating in elections, and offers specific recommendations to inform voter engagement work in 2022 and in the future. “The last two elections featured major increases in voter turnout, but we should not be satisfied,” said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, Newhouse Director of CIRCLE. “Youth remain underrepresented in the electorate and participation remains highly inequitable, with some young people’s voting rates as much as 40 points higher than others. That leads to some young people’s views being disregarded in our democracy, and points to a failure of institutions whose role it is to prepare young people to sustain our Republic. We have to do better. The CIRCLE Growing Voters report outlines why many current youth voter engagement efforts have been insufficient. It details a shift from short-term voter mobilization to a developmental approach that helps all youth learn about elections. Newly released data based on an exclusive survey of teens (ages 14-17), CIRCLE survey data from the past two national elections, analyses of voter files, and extensive past research on youth civic education and engagement inform the report’s calls to action</span></p>

It would provide states with grants to boost pay for poll workers. Levin says those workers play a key role in the infrastructure of democracy. “Election workers must be compensated adequately for their services and sacrifice,” he said. “And until that happens, we&#8217;ll have trouble retaining and attracting enough workers to run our elections properly.” Cheryl Rottmann is the city clerk in Madison Heights. She said most of her poll workers are older people, and they’re paid what amounts to minimum wage for an 18-hour day. “This legislation will also enable clerks such as myself to recruit the next generation of poll workers, and create sustainability in staffing elections,” Rottmann said.</span></p>

It would also make sure eligible voters who are incarcerated can request a mail ballot and vote and would take steps to modernize the state’s election administration process. The legislation is a compromise version of separate bills approved earlier by House and Senate lawmakers. The final bill does not include any provisions that would let individuals both register and vote on Election Day.</span></p>

It’s one election law that’s inspired rare agreement between political advocates according to the New Hampshire Bulleting on the left and right. Under the state’s current system for machine-counted ballots, if a voter marks their ballot in such a way that a machine thinks they may have voted for more candidates than allowed, the vote in that race does not count. Overvoting is not uncommon. The bill requires the machines to be programmed to return any ballot deemed to be an overvote to the voter. The voter would then have the opportunity to amend the ballot to make clear the candidate or candidates they wanted. The bill requires election officials to tell the voter to deposit the ballot into a separate box; all ballots in that box would then be hand counted by election officials once the polls had closed. </span></p>

Bills include: A3817, which would require early and absentee votes to be counted by election district rather than municipality, shorten the deadline for curing absentee ballots, and allow voters to apply for mail-in ballots and update their voter registration online, among other changes; Another bill would allow Boards of Elections to begin processing and counting mail-in ballots five days before election day, which could speed up the release of unofficial election results. The bill would also require mail-in ballots postmarked by election day to arrive within three days of Election Day, instead of six days as is the case under current law.</span></p>

Supporters say the shift could boost participation, particularly among underrepresented groups, such as young people and communities of color.  The proposal, from Democratic Council Chair Claudia Balducci, would amend King County’s charter so that elections for County offices happen at the same time as state and national elections, which typically see higher participation. Since 2010, voter turnout in King County has averaged 77% in even-numbered years and just 47% in odd-numbered years. City and other local elections, many of which are currently held in odd-numbered years, would not be impacted by the change.</span></p>

The commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court decision. Attorneys for the state argued that that delaying the certification of election results would have far-reaching consequences on the election. It would require delaying the special general election, currently scheduled on Aug. 16, to a later date, meaning Alaska’s lone U.S. House seat would remain vacant for a longer period. It would also force that election — the state’s first under ranked choice voting — to be held entirely by mail. An explanation for the Supreme Court’s decision “will follow at a later date,” according to</span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22058347/s18442_2022-06-11_o2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the court’s order,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued late Saturday morning.</span></p>

The race in House District 25 took place in three counties: Crawford, Franklin and Washington. The lawsuit disputes the count by the Crawford County Election Commission. The case was filed in Franklin County, citing Arkansas Code 7-5-801(b). The law says an election contest of a district office may be brought in any county in the district. Certified results in all three counties together show Puryear winning 2,211 votes to Harris&#8217; 2,204 in the May 24 primary. The suit disputes the counting of absentee ballots in Crawford County. By law, the suit contends, absentee ballots should have been counted first but weren&#8217;t counted until other results were in and until a pro-Harris poll-watcher demanded it. Then they were mishandled while being counted, according to the suit. Those absentee ballots made the difference in the race, the suit contends. The suit asks the court to void the House 25 race results but doesn&#8217;t seek specific relief beyond that. What happens if the election is declared void is up to the court now, a spokesman for the Arkansas Secretary of State&#8217;s office said Tuesday. The lawsuit notes that the Election Commission&#8217;s chairman is Bill Coleman, brother of Rep. Bruce Coleman, R-Mountainburg, who didn&#8217;t seek reelection in the district and who declared his support of Puryear. Bruce Coleman donated $1,000 to Puryear&#8217;s campaign, finance records show.</span></p>

That decision cleared the way for the controversial law to be in place for this year’s elections.</span></p>

Johnson was disqualified after a review of bureau of elections found nearly 9,400 of this 23,000 signature he submitted were fraudulent. He needed 15,000 in order to appear on the August primary ballot. Goldsmith rebuffed each part of Johnson’s argument, writing the candidate had more than enough time to challenge the decisions, and failed to cast reasonable doubt on the bureau’s approach to checking for falsified signatures. “The BOE staff employed eminently reasonable procedures to give Johnson’s petition a fair and particularized review while operating on a tight timeline to advance important and compelling state interests,” Goldsmith wrote in the order. Ballot printing is already underway for Oakland County, the state second-most populous, said director of elections Joe Rozell. He said being forced to reprint ballots would’ve been impossible as their printer “did not have enough paper on hand to reprint of a county our size.” If Johnson’s request had succeeded, Oakland County Clerk Lisa Brown, a Democrat, said the county would have failed to meet requirements under the law and state constitution. Ballots must be given to local clerks by June 18.</span></p>

We affirm,” Justice J. Ishee wrote. Oliver Johnson, who lost to then Ward 1 incumbent Al Brock by nine votes, and Chauncy Wright, to then Ward 6 incumbent James Wilson by 88 votes, consolidated their petitions filed in Washington County Circuit, which claimed multiple voting irregularities. Both parties conducted an examination of the ballot boxes on Dec. 17, 2019 according to court documents.   Johnson then filed his petition to contest the election in Ward 1 on Dec. 27, 2019 and Wright filed his election contest on Dec. 30, 2019. Court documents state Johnson and Wright both “made similar claims of alleged voting irregularities, including but not being limited to, procedural violations of election officials of dealing with affidavit ballots, distance limitations, improper poll watcher actions.”  After a May 2020 hearing at which the parties were allowed to offer testimony, the circuit court concluded that “Johnson and Wright had failed to provide proof to establish that any of the conduct complained of caused their election losses and that to conclude otherwise would be sheer speculation.” Based on what Justice Ishee stated further, Johnson and Wright needed to exhibit sufficient evidence to establish the essential element of their election contest claim that the alleged voting improprieties that occurred during the election impacted the number of votes each of them received.</span></p>

Toulouse Oliver’s request came a day after the three-member Otero County commission, in its role as a county canvassing board, voted unanimously against certifying the results of the June 7 primary without raising specific concerns about discrepancies. Under state law, county canvass boards can call on a voting precinct board to address specific discrepancies, but no discrepancies were identified on Monday by the Otero commission. “The post-election canvassing process is a key component of how we maintain our high levels of election integrity in New Mexico and the Otero County Commission is flaunting that process by appeasing unfounded conspiracy theories and potentially nullifying the votes of every Otero County voter who participated in the primary,” Toulouse Oliver said in a statement. She accused the commission of willful violations of the state election code. Otero County Commissioner Vickie Marquardt laughed at the suggestion that a court might intervene in the election dispute. “And so then what? They’re going to send us to the pokey?” she said. Late Wednesday,<a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2022/06/16/otero-county-commission-ordered-to-certify-primary-election-results/"> the Supreme Court ordered the county commission to comply</a> with state law and certify the election. The commission has until Friday to meet and certify the election or presumably face a contempt of court charge. Commissioner Couy Griffin told <em>NM Political Report</em> that he plans to “hold the line.” “What the state is trying to do to us by leveraging us, and taking control, essentially, of our commission board through the courts, I believe, is very unconstitutional and it’s an absolute disgrace.” Toulouse Oliver said the state is already in “uncharted waters” after the commission refused to follow state law, but that she is not sure what would happen if the commission does not follow the court’s order.  “At this point, the presumption, of course, is that the board of canvas, aka, the county commission will convene to certify by the deadline,” Toulouse said. “I have no doubt that their attorney is advising them of their mandatory, non-discriminate, non-discretionary duty and the supreme court order. If they don’t, to be very frank, I don’t know what will happen.”</p>

The legal challenge to the duel primaries was filed last month by the good-government organization against the state Board of Elections after New York&#8217;s top court tossed out the state lawmaker-drawn district lines for the U.S. House seats in New York as well as the state Senate. Because of the looming primary, a lower court moved the vote for those races to August, severing them from the already scheduled June 28 for the races unaffected by the redistricting ruling. The League of Women Voters had argued the two primaries would be a costly burden for taxpayers and local elections officials. But the state Board of Elections argued the case would make the elections even more expensive given the ballots had already been printed, and staffing already planned. A five-judge panel ultimately agreed the legal challenge was filed too late. &#8220;Such delay was entirely avoidable and undertaken without any reasonable explanation,&#8221; the court found.

In the filing to Geauga County Common Pleas Court Judge Carolyn Paschke, the BOE claims commissioners failed to account for several critical aspects of the administration of elections in the design of the new county building on Ravenwood Drive. The BOE believes is a complicated and unfit layout for early voting and other election business, and has inadequate storage space for “100 DS-200 voting machines, 40 Express Vote machines, 372 privacy booths, 79 ballot boxes and a very large supply of tables, A-frame signs, cabinets, cones, poles and pole bases, flags, carts, work lights, yard signs, among other equipment and supplies necessary to conduct a county-wide election.” Additionally, the BOE is requesting the court force payment for a chemical fire suppressant system that would not damage the board’s voting machines in case of an emergency.</span></p>

Although the case arose from a single local judicial race, it raised broader issues about how federal voting-rights protections apply when voters fail to meet state clerical requirements — a conflict that may crop up again in this year’s midterm elections. In an unsigned and unexplained order, the justices rejected an emergency appeal from a Republican candidate who currently holds a narrow lead in a 2021 race for a judgeship on a Lehigh County trial court. The candidate, David Ritter, wanted the justices to block the local board of elections from counting ballots that were received by Election Day but arrived in undated envelopes. Justice Samuel Alito dissented from the ruling, in a five-page opinion that was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. He urged the court to take up the case on the merits and fast-track it for an argument in October so that it can resolve the issue before the November elections.</span></p>
<p>Lehigh Valley state Senate primary finally has a winner, now that a mail-in ballot lawsuit is settled. Tara Zrinski conceded to Nick Miller in the Democratic primary race for the 14th District.

While the results of the May election will not be affected by this settlement, these new measures will help protect future elections from being called into question due to uncounted ballots, and help ensure voters understand what they need to do to comply with the law. This settlement does not solve all of the issues with Pennsylvania’s voting laws. However, we believe this is a huge step in the right direction and hopefully the General Assembly will use the recent voter lawsuits as the impetus for major voting reform in Harrisburg,” Attorney Matthew Mobilio said. The federal lawsuit had said mail-in ballots mailed in without the secrecy envelope and those not received by Election Day in the May primary election should be counted immediately. The suit was filed on behalf of nine voters, who the suit says are among the more than 260 voters in the 14th Senate District whose ballots were deemed invalid for those reasons. The settlement means the primary election results will be certified, without the 260 improper mail-in ballots.</p>

Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green announced the creation of a civics readiness task force that will study whether to add a half-credit course in civics in grades eight and high school, encourage students to have respectful conversations on difficult topics, provide instruction on voter registration, and add a seal of civics readiness to the high-school diploma. Although both parties disagreed on the constitutional issues raised by the lawsuit, they never differed on the value of offering a rich civics education to all students.</p>

The U.S. Fifth Circuit of Appeals sent a series of questions to the Texas Supreme Court ahead of issuing its final ruling on the case. Of three main issues, one raised several questions pertaining to the definition of “solicit.” The questions arose after the plaintiff, Harris County Elections Administrator Isabel Longoria, argued the vagueness of the term. In one argument, Longoria’s attorneys requested that the term “solicit” be tethered only to vote-by-mail applications sent to those ineligible voters. State justices rejected that request. “The statute does not prohibit solicitation merely of those ineligible to vote by mail. Its text leaves no doubt that the prohibition extends more broadly to the larger universe of persons who ‘did not request an application,’” the opinion read. In a second request, Longoria’s team argued that “solicitation” in its broad definition could include terms that are less forceful in nature, including “encourage” or “request. While justices refrained from defining “solicit,” stating they were not requested to, they agreed with Paxton that “solicit” is not limited to demands that a person submit an application to vote by mail, but includes statements such as “please fill out this application to vote by mail.” But justices did find that telling potential voters they have the opportunity to apply for mail-in ballots does not constitute solicitation. “The Legislature intended to distinguish between merely informing Texans of the option to vote by mail and soliciting them to submit an application to vote by mail when they have not requested one,” the opinion read. “Without expressing an opinion as to any particular statement plaintiffs may wish to make, we conclude that (the law) does not include broad statements such as telling potential voters that they have the opportunity to apply for mail-in ballots.”</span></p>

House elections in 2021 were supposed to be the first held under constitutionally required redistricting based on the 2020 census. But because census results were delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the state held elections under old legislative boundaries. A lawsuit filed by a Democratic Party activist a year ago was dismissed last week by a three-judge panel that found Goldman did not have standing as a voter or a potential candidate to file the lawsuit. Days later, Jeff Thomas, an author who has written extensively about Virginia government and politics, filed a similar lawsuit. Thomas alleges that the 2021 House elections were invalid and asks the court to order new elections this year under the updated districts. WRIC-TV reports that during a hearing,  Novak ordered an expedited schedule for Thomas’ lawsuit and criticized former Attorney General Mark Herring&#8217;s office for delaying the earlier lawsuit with appeals before the issue of Goldman&#8217;s standing was decided. “It is really just not appropriate, the way they handled this case,” Novak said of Herring’s office.</span></p>
