							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Communications help on demand</strong><br />
<em>Election Official Legal Defense Network expands help to communication</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>After more than a year of providing pro bono legal assistance to elections officials, the<a href="https://eoldn.org/"> Election Official Legal Defense Network</a> has expanded the assistance it provides to provide assistance in another pressing matter — communications.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8832" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-15-at-12.14.21-PM-300x121.png" alt="" width="300" height="121" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-15-at-12.14.21-PM-300x121.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-15-at-12.14.21-PM.png 478w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“After spending the last year providing pro bono legal assistance to those who professionally administer U.S. elections, we consistently heard from our clients that they not only need legal help, but they also need advice and support when it comes to disinformation attacks designed to injure their public reputations and impede their work,” said David Becker, Executive Director of EOLDN.</p>
<p>Becker said elections officials have talked about being inundated with disinformation, and needing help in providing accurate, official information to push back on the lies. The challenge, he noted, is not only creating an effective truthful narrative, but also navigating the bandwidth issues that overwhelm the staff in an election office.</p>
<p>“We want to meet both these challenges by providing communications professionals to assist them both with expertise, and bandwidth challenges,” Becker said.</p>
<p>Any election official who needs communications advice or assistance can go to<a href="https://eoldn.org/"> eoldn.org</a> and click on the “request help” button. There will be an option to request communications assistance, and within 1 business day EOLDN get back to the requestor and begin the process of pairing that election official with a communications professional.</p>
<p>EOLDN has retained a communications firm to provide this assistance, with a professional who works in communications assigned to assist each election official.</p>
<p>This combined communications and legal service is available to any election official, completely free of charge. This service is available whether they need it for planning, rapid response, or anything in between.</p>
<p>There are several groups who have provided really useful materials and reports to assist election officials with communications and efforts to combat disinformation and Becker sees the work of EOLDN as a complement to that work.</p>
<p>“But one thing we’re hearing is that election offices are overwhelmed with work right now, and sometimes they just need a person who can help them deal with an urgent communications need, perhaps correcting disinformation that might be circulating,” Becker said. “This can be a particular challenge for small and medium size jurisdictions that might not have the resources for their own communications staff. We hope that this service will help these election offices, and complement the work that others have done.”</p>
<p>Whatever communications needs an election office has, EOLDN is available to help. That includes traditional media, social media, messaging, planning, rapid response, and anything else an election office needs to support their work and combat disinformation.</p>
<p>With T-54 days till the November 8 elections officials are overwhelmed with regular election preparations, record requests and of course keeping the public informed. Becker said the best thing for most officials is to keep it as simple as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most voters don’t think about elections as much as we all do, and it’s important to recognize that simple, positive messaging is effective,&#8221; Becker said. &#8220;Rather than focus on the highly specific information that might differ from county to county, focus on those things that are common among all jurisdictions – transparency, bipartisanship, and professionalism. Every single election office has these things in common, ensuring that the multiple checks and balances in the process work.&#8221;</p>

							<h2>National Disability Voting Rights Week</h2>
														<p><strong>Honoring National Disability Voting Rights Week</strong><br />
<em>U.S. Vote Foundation Launches New Disability Voting Guide and Disability Guest Blog Series</em></p>
<p>By Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, President and CEO<br />
U.S. Vote Foundation and Overseas Vote</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8833" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/USVF_logo_H-300x125.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="125" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/USVF_logo_H-300x125.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/USVF_logo_H-1024x426.jpg 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/USVF_logo_H-768x319.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/USVF_logo_H.jpg 1176w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />At<a href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/"> U.S. Vote Foundation</a> (US Vote), our mission is simple: Every Citizen is a Voter. With that mission comes the responsibility to ensure that every eligible citizen can access a ballot and have it counted. Voting patterns from the 2020 election show an alarming trend: While absentee voting was up across the board, a key constituency – voters with disabilities – were still struggling to make their voices heard.</p>
<p>In our work to expand voting access for all citizens we are excited to launch US Vote’s new<a href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/disabled-voter-guide"> resource guide for voters with disabilities</a>. Together with a<a href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/blog"> guest blog series on disability voting</a>, the launch marks the 2022 National Disability Voting Rights Week.</p>
<p>Since our founding in 2005, we’ve served as a resource for all voters seeking general information on upcoming elections, including registration basics, absentee ballot requests, and direct access to local elections officials. Over the years we’ve become known as a one-stop resource for voting, absentee or in-person, whether for domestic voters or those living abroad or in the military.</p>
<p>When the pandemic hit, voters, whether to protect their health or that of their communities, began using absentee voting at even higher rates. We were thrilled to see so many states expand their absentee ballot offerings in 2020, resulting in greater accessibility for all Americans. At a time when turnout could have plummeted, we saw<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/voter-turnout/"> voter participation at its highest (66%) in over a century</a>.</p>
<p>We also noticed that, in the same election, more Americans with disabilities participated than ever before. Indeed, mail-in voting ameliorated difficulties reported by disabled Americans: in 2020, 11.4 percent of voters with disabilities reported problems with voting, down from<a href="https://www.eac.gov/news/2021/07/07/new-data-177-million-americans-disabilities-voted-2020-significant-increase-over"> 26 percent in 2012</a>. And some<a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2018/02/01/how-voters-with-disabilities-are-blocked-from-the-ballot-box"> two-thirds of polling locations audited had at least one barrier</a> present to those with disabilities.</p>
<p>When it became clear that, post-pandemic, some states were putting restrictions on absentee voting &#8211; by eliminating drop boxes, limiting who could return completed absentee ballots on voters’ behalf, and instituting complicated signature requirements &#8211; we recognized that not only would this make voting harder for all Americans, but that voting would potentially become especially difficult for those with disabilities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8834" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/USVote_Disability_Voting-300x265.png" alt="" width="300" height="265" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/USVote_Disability_Voting-300x265.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/USVote_Disability_Voting-1024x906.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/USVote_Disability_Voting-768x679.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/USVote_Disability_Voting.png 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />During our research, we came across a<a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-in-2020/blocked-from-the-ballot-box/"> key article by Elizabeth Pendo</a>, a professor at Saint Louis University School of Law and an expert in disability law, that made the same point. This set us on another mission: to provide a place on our website where disabled Americans could readily find the information and data they need to vote; contact their local election officials; and advocate for reform as needed.</p>
<p>The complexity of fulfilling this mission made us realize how essential this effort is. We quickly found out that the information needed to empower disabled persons in making choices about voting was very difficult to find. In fact, as we conducted research for our<a href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/disabled-voter-guide"> Voters with Disabilities</a> guide, we noticed serious information gaps, even on state websites. Our staff, though research-savvy, found it could take hours to locate basic info on voter accessibility issues, such as who could pick up a ballot, who could return a ballot on behalf of someone else, and where to make a complaint about an accessibility problem, among many other issues. No one should need that much time to figure out how to vote!</p>
<p>This information gap further prompted us to develop what we proudly believe to be the most comprehensive voter guide for Americans with disabilities, no matter where they live. Indeed, as of now, no other state-by-state resource exists that consolidates, in an accessible and clear way, all the information needed for voters with disabilities to cast ballots successfully and confidently &#8211; whether for the first or 50th time.</p>
<p>We’re proud of the effort &#8211; and of the final product:<a href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/disabled-voter-guide"> U.S. Vote Foundation’s Disability Voting Guide.</a></p>
<p>The goal of the initiative that led to the Disability Voting Guide was to create the definitive resource that brings together relevant information in one central location, saving voters hours of searching. The Disability Voting Guide not only informs and empowers voters who visit the Guide’s home page but also enable voters to access all US Vote’s available resources &#8211; as well as contact local officials for assistance, if needed.</p>
<p>The topics covered in the Disability Voting Guide include state and federal information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voter eligibility (who can register to vote)</li>
<li>Voter rights (at federal and state levels)</li>
<li>Ways to vote in a specific state, especially the alternative methods available to voters with disabilities (absentee/mail-in ballot requests, etc.)</li>
<li>Information on accommodations and rules of assistance</li>
<li>Information, when available, on the voting accessibility devices used at polling locations (or whom to contact for information if it is not readily available online)</li>
</ul>
<p>Where and how to file complaints, self-advocate, or reach out for assistance if someone’s voting rights have been violated</p>
<p>Our future plans include providing this information in PDF format for people who use screen readers as well as audio files for the visually impaired so as to make these pages as accessible as possible.</p>
<p><strong>“It Can’t Be About Us Without Us”</strong><br />
We’ve been mindful to create this product in collaboration with those most impacted by the services we provide. Our friends and partners in this effort, individuals who lead disability-advocacy organizations and lecture in universities – many of whom have disabilities – helped remind us that the work “can’t be about us without us.”</p>
<p>To that end, we have sought to partner and co-create these services every step of the way. Leaders from<a href="https://www.accessthevote.org/"> Access the Vote Florida</a>,<a href="https://www.aapd.com/"> AAPD (American Association of People with Disabilities</a>),<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LKQY79Y"> the “Rev Up” campaign</a>, and others have all guided us by providing feedback, reviewing documents, and asking key questions. As our relationships solidified, we recognized not only the importance of this guide but also the necessity to highlight our partners’ own stories, advice, and advocacy. That’s why, for<a href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/national-disability-voting-rights"> National Disability Voting Rights Week</a>, we enlisted five disability-rights advocates and scholars to present their views and recommendations on our blog. Check out their<a href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/blog"> blog posts on disability voting topics</a> from voting with aphasia, current barriers to voting, and ways to close the 6% gap (between Americans with and without disabilities).</p>
<p>This work is comprehensive, collaborative and &#8211; importantly &#8211; ongoing.</p>
<p>US Vote has also created one of the most thorough state-by-state guides on voting for those with felony convictions. And now we’ve added the most comprehensive state-by-state guide for voters with disabilities. We won’t stop here! As one of the most mainstream, visited, and accessible voter authorities online, we intend to cover other special voting circumstances to provide accurate, up-to-date information for voters &#8211; whatever their zip code, no matter their special interest.</p>
<p>Keep checking us out as we keep expanding! And reach out if you’d like to collaborate on an area we haven’t yet covered. Creating an America where every citizen votes requires our working together. Let’s collectively get it done.</p>

In<a href="https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/09/14/delaware-2022-primary-day-live-updates-key-races/69492044007/"> Delaware</a>, about<a href="https://www.delawarepublic.org/politics-government/2022-09-12/early-voting-ends-around-20-000-cast-or-mailed-in"> 20,000 ballots</a> were cast before election day — either via early voting or by mail — but people still showed up at the polls on Tuesday where there were some minor problems. The biggest issues seemed to be scattered power outages in places like<a href="https://www.wmdt.com/2022/09/power-outage-in-georgetown-polling-site-doesnt-slow-down-voting/"> Georgetown</a> and<a href="https://townsquaredelaware.com/primary-election-starts-with-uneven-crowds/"> Rehoboth Beach</a>. Sussex County, poll worker Barbara Steele said it has been a busy morning. “We’ve had really good turnout for a primary election,” she said. “Everything seems to be going smoothly and we are happy to see so many people come out to vote.” One poll worker in<a href="https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/09/14/delaware-2022-primary-day-live-updates-key-races/69492044007/"> Cape Henlopen</a> reported having to help voters find their correct polling places after they were confused about redistricting. For the first time since 1976, someone else oversaw the elections in<a href="https://indepthnh.org/2022/09/13/sos-scanlan-n-h-knows-how-to-do-elections/"> New Hampshire</a> and according to new Secretary of State David Scanlan, things went smoothly. “It was a routine election,” Scanlan said. “New Hampshire knows how to do elections.” There were no long lines or major complaints. A<a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-primary-election-turnout-scanlan/41202219"> few minor problems</a> cropped up. A couple of small towns, New Castle and Woodstock were concerned about having enough Republican ballots, but got more. Following unintentional ballot mistakes in 2020, Windham, Bedford and Laconia were all assigned<a href="https://www.nhpr.org/politics/2022-09-14/as-election-distrust-swirls-three-n-h-communities-were-under-a-microscope-during-the-primary"> elections monitors</a> by the state. Eugene Van Loan, the election monitor assigned to Windham said things to be going smoothly. “I think that’s very unfortunate because I have great faith in our election processes. I have great faith in the people that run them,” said Van Loan, who served for years as Bedford’s moderator. “Some level of trying to convince people that things are fair and accurate is almost as important or, let&#8217;s say, of some significant importance, as the reality that they are fair and that they are accurate.” At least one local race ended in a<a href="https://www.conwaydailysun.com/news/local/conway-tie-to-be-decided-in-concord/article_9e9bb124-3436-11ed-95d7-abbcfc5d6dc5.html"> tie</a> that will need to be broken by lots. The biggest issues facing the<a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/13/rhode-island-primary-election-2022-hours-ballots-candidates-results/8024443001/"> Rhode Island</a> primary happened during<a href="https://www.abc6.com/board-of-elections-cancels-emergency-meeting-on-voting-machines-ahead-of-tuesdays-primary/"> early voting</a> when people using the Spanish language feature on the ExpressVote machines were given the wrong candidates. Primary day itself was a<a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/13/rhode-island-primary-election-2022-hours-ballots-candidates-results/8024443001/"> wet one</a> in Rhode Island and with early and mail voting turnout was light. Eighteen-year-old Kingston DaLomba was doing his civic duty by<a href="https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/13/rhode-island-primary-election-2022-hours-ballots-candidates-results/8024443001/"> voting for the first time</a>. “I feel like if I want to create change that I want to see around me, I should be voting in local elections,” DaLomba said. “So I made sure I researched everything.

Some counties have had to bring on temporary or permanent staff to deal with the requests.

She was 93. Alsdorf was one of the longest-serving Garfield County elected officials, becoming Clerk and Recorder in 1978 after seven years working for her predecessor and remaining in the clerk’s position until 2006. In that role, she oversaw many county elections, as well as motor-vehicle registrations, real-estate transactions and vital records. “It was such a pleasure working for her, and she was such a wonderful example for us,” said current Clerk and Recorder Jean Alberico, who immediately succeeded Alsdorf and is also retiring after this year.  “She was a public servant at heart, and she loved being county clerk,” Alerico said. “She was just a warm, caring person.” Even though she was an active member of the Garfield County Republican Party, she was the consummate nonpartisan when it came to carrying out the duties of the Clerk and Recorder’s Office and in helping people understand the political process, daughter Pati Moreno noted. She recalled that her mother always enjoyed speaking to high school and college civics and government classes alongside representatives from the local Democratic Party and helping explain the different points of view and the elections process in general.  “When people talk about her, you can just hear the smile in their voice,” Moreno said. “It just brings so much joy. … And she always accepted people and passed onto us that we need to be more accepting of others.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7060" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9559.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Federal Legislation</strong>: Bipartisan elections-related legislation is on hold with the clock ticking down to the end of the 117th Congress. “It’s something we’d like to get done. And we’re going to try to figure out the best way to get it done,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters this week. There’s an urgency to act because Democrats — and some Republicans — worry that a possible GOP-controlled House would ignore the issue next year. But in the Senate, the growing expectation is that a vote will be punted into the lame duck session between the Nov. 8 midterm election and when the new Congress is seated on Jan. 3. One reason for the delay is the calendar and the other is that the proposals—the Electoral County Act and Enhanced Election Security and Protection Act are still being negotiated. The main elections-related bill is the<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-grapples-election-reform-legislation-time-runs-short-act-rcna46738"> Enhanced Election Security and Protection Act</a>, which would establish new rules for protecting electronic records and toughen penalties for intimidating poll workers or officials. There is some pessimism that it won’t have the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster, as some Republicans, including Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Sen. Lindsey Graham of south Carolina, have endorsed the first bill but not the second. Johnson said he firmly opposed the second bill. “I’m not generally in favor of the federal government being involved in the elections that should be run by the states,” Johnson said, arguing that it&#8217;s better to have “individual states be responsible for their elections.” But some in the bipartisan working group, including Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., have hope that both bills can secure the 60 votes needed to pass, even if it’s a different set of Republicans who ultimately get each piece of legislation across the finish line. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., agreed with Tillis, though he said that Congress must give priority to the Electoral Count Act. “I think we have support for both bills but the Electoral Count Act is by far the priority focus at this point. It’s a complete package. The other is important, but there are some issues that could be run into,” Cardin said.</p>

According to the Record Searchlight, many in the supervisors chambers came in anticipation of an agenda item in which the board would consider taking action related to preserving election materials from the 2020 election. But a motion made by District 4 Supervisor Patrick Jones asking Darling Allen to preserve the ballots for six months to give supporters time to file a lawsuit failed to get a second motion. So Darling Allen will now go ahead and destroy or recycle the ballots and other materials. By election law, she has the ability to do so 22 months after the election. The 2020 deadline to do that was Sept. 3.  &#8220;22 months is enough time to file 22 lawsuits&#8221; but to date none have been submitted,” said Supervisor Les Baugh. &#8220;This county (voted for) President (Donald) Trump. Why you want to contest that as a conservative county, I have no idea.”</p>

Under the bill, the city would take information it collects when residents interact with the Department of Motor Vehicles and other agencies to maintain a constantly-updating list of people who are “preapproved” to vote. For people on that list, all there would be left to do is to vote come election time.  “Traditionally, registration has been used as a way to keep people from voting,” Charles Allen, the D.C. councilmember who is sponsoring the legislation, told Bolts. “It’s a way to be a gatekeeper as to who you think should be able to vote.”  Under Allen’s bill, voting itself would be the act of registration—at least for those the city identifies as prequalified. This would “make sure we are really reaching every single person we possibly can to make sure they can participate and have their voice heard,” Allen said. “We already have a version of automatic voter registration, and this really takes it further,” he told Bolts. “We want to make it as automatic as possible.” His bill would not exactly move D.C. to a “back-end” system like Colorado’s because it wouldn’t outright register people. But it’s guided by a similar principle that it’s really up to public authorities to review someone’s eligibility based on the information they’ve already shared. Under his proposal, as long as someone has provided certain documents, the city would verify and record them as eligible: This would pre-qualify them as voters, even when they’re not formally on voter rolls.  D.C. would then send people on this preapproved list a mail-in ballot for every election during the following two years. They would never need to proactively register, though they would be given an opportunity to remove their name from this list through a mailer. D.C. would also inform them that they can return a ballot or head to the polls to activate their registration. All they would need to do at that point is choose whether or not to vote.</p>

The van will be used for registering people to vote, filling out absentee voter applications and early voting. The commissioners voted for themselves to be in charge of deciding when and where to send the mobile voting unit, to be manned by members from the Democratic and Republican parties. Commission President Sheila Matias said a schedule for use of the van will be developed and posted on the county government website. She said the primary idea is to make voting possible for people unable to cast a ballot due to physical, transportation and other challenges. Commissioner Joe Haney, who cast the negative vote, argued the van should remain under the control of the LaPorte County Voter Registration Office to avoid any appearance of impropriety. He said he didn’t see a problem if the commissioners suggested times and locations for using the van, but felt them deciding the schedule will create questions as to whether the van is used for things like ballot harvesting to give candidates from one party an advantage.</p>

The stated process for election workers to handle situations with those labeled “non-citizens,” what happened during the last election and what the correct approach is. Details about the functionality of the three Fargo polling sites, such as issues identifying the correct ballots for voters, the length of the lines that voters had to wait in and any complaints regarding the physical voting sites’ accessibility and/or ease of locating the sites. The availability of election judges and workers. An update on the process of recruitment, training and management of election staff. An explanation of how problems in the process will be corrected. “It’s worth noting that nobody is saying we have election problems here,” Commissioner John Strand said, admitting that while there is room for improvement in such a diverse community, there have been no allegations of election fraud. The report from the Cass County election administrators will be given to the Human Rights Commission once completed, then will go to the Fargo City Commission.</p>

<p>With only seven legislative session days left before the General Election on November 8, House Democrats are calling on Harrisburg&#8217;s Republican leaders to pass a clean<a href="https://www.erienewsnow.com/story/47285652/house-democrats-seek-to-pass-legislation-allowing-counties-to-precanvass-ballots"> pre-canvassing bill</a>.  Currently, mail-in and absentee ballots cannot be prepared for counting until 7 a.m. on Election Day.  This effects elections as seen in November 2020, and again in May 2022, when voters had to wait several days to learn the results of certain races while those ballots were being processed.  Allowing counties to pre-canvass ballots earlier would mean faster vote counts and results.  Several House Democrats have introduced standalone legislation that would allow counties to pre-canvass these ballots, but said Republican leaders in Harrisburg refuse to bring up pre-canvassing unless it&#8217;s tied to other legislation that divides the House.</p>

After hours of public comment and council debate last month, a council majority had voted against Councilman Stephen J. Urban’s proposed ordinance banning the use of county staff and resources to deliver mail ballot drop boxes to sites approved by the county’s independent citizen election board. A key argument against passage was that the county likely would be sued because the election board — not council — has authority to decide whether drop boxes are used, officials had said. Urban had publicly acknowledged the election board’s authority over the use of boxes, saying that was why he did not seek an outright ban. Board members would still be free to deliver the boxes, Urban had said. Now Councilman Brian Thornton is pushing for introduction of an ordinance that would outright ban drop boxes in the county.</p>

The reversal will removes the referendum about discontinuing the user of electronic voting systems in future elections. The referendum was initially approved by Commissioners Scott Metzger and Tony Mussare.  A small group of residents had asked the commissioners to end the use of electronic machines in favor of reverting to paper ballots. Commissioners  agreed to put the question on the ballot in November, voting to add the referendum at their September 6 meeting. After receiving a letter from the Pennsylvania Department of State warning commissioners that the addition of the referendum would be in violation of the Help America Vote Act, the commissioners made the decision to remove the referendum Monday. The state department said the county did not seek the consent of the legislature prior to adding the referendum, which is required under HAVA. The letter also said paper ballots were resolutely not allowed under HAVA.  Metzger said, after conferring with legal counsel, they were told they&#8217;d lose in court regarding the former violation listed by the DOS, but that he felt they could have won on the latter.</p>

The vote was procedural, and the council would have to vote again before the charter change proposal appeared on the 2023 Town Meeting Day ballot. Burlingtonians are already set to use the voting method in the 2023 council elections, but Councilor Jack Hanson, P-East District, said the city shouldn’t stop there. Councilor Mark Barlow, D-North District, along with Councilor Sarah Carpenter, D-Ward 4, cast the sole votes in opposition to the measure. Barlow said during the meeting that his no vote rested on his previous understanding that ranked choice voting would be “tested out” on city council elections before it could be extended to mayoral elections.</p>

Making claims of defamation and computer fraud, Konnech sued True the Vote Inc., a Texas nonprofit, its founder Catherine Engelbrecht and board member Gregg Phillips in Houston federal court. Konnech sells election logistics software called PollChief to U.S. governmental entities, which they use to manage poll workers and coordinate distribution of equipment and technical support staff to polling places. Though its software is meant to help county, city and local governments run elections more efficiently, Konnech underscores the limits of its services in its lawsuit.  “Konnech’s software products are not involved in any way in the registration of voters, the production, distribution, scanning, or processing of ballots, nor the collection, counting or reporting of votes,&#8221; the complaint states. &#8220;Indeed, Konnech never handles any ballots and no ballots or other voting counts ever enter any of Konnech’s computer servers.” Represented by Constantine Pamphilis of the Houston firm Kasowitz Benson Torres, Konnech seeks damages on claims of defamation, tortious interference, conversion and violations of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and two Texas statutes: the Harmful Access by Computer Act and Theft Liability Act.

Griffin agreed with the lawyers from the Alabama attorney general’s office, who said the claims were based on speculation and asked for the dismissal. The state’s lawyers said the machines are not equipped to connect to the internet and it would take a series of improbable actions to carry out the potential tampering and vote-changing that is the basis of the lawsuit. The plaintiffs asked Griffin for a preliminary injunction to bar the use of the machines and order hand counts of ballots in the general election in November. Griffin denied that as moot after granting the motion to dismiss the case. The state argued that a change to a hand-count system would be a “gargatuan, last-minute overhaul of the election process.” The plaintiffs sued Merrill and the five members of the Alabama Electronic Voting Committee, which certifies voting machines used by Alabama counties.</p>

It means the case remains on schedule for arguments later this month that could decide Wasilla Republican Rep. David Eastman’s future as a candidate and a legislator. The order by McKenna denied an attempt by the division to dismiss itself from a lawsuit challenging Eastman’s eligibility for office. The lawsuit was filed July 26 by Randall Kowalke, a former member of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough Assembly, who claims that Eastman’s membership in a far-right organization violates the “disloyalty clause” of the Alaska Constitution. That clause says in part that anyone who belongs to or supports an organization that advocates the “overthrow by force or violence” of the U.S. government shall not be eligible for public office. Attorneys representing the division said it should not be in charge of enforcing the clause because it lacks investigatory powers and that making judgments about the clause could be seen as a partisan act. McKenna acknowledged the difficulty of investigating claims but said the division has a duty to enforce the Alaska Constitution.</p>

Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek, was supposed to take effect Sept. 24. It would have required county officials to attempt to confirm any information they received that a voter registration wasn&#8217;t valid. If House Bill 2243 took effect this month, it would allow enough time to &#8220;purge voters&#8221; just before the start of early voting in October, said in an Aug. 25 court motion by the Arizona Asian American Native Hawaiian And Pacific Islander For Equity Coalition, a local nonprofit civil rights group. Besides potentially purging valid voters, the law would &#8220;frighten Arizona’s voters of color and naturalized voters from registering, including by threat of criminal investigation if they simply are unable to quickly provide (proof of citizenship),&#8221; the coalition&#8217;s motion stated. Bolton granted the group&#8217;s request for an injunction, ordering the plaintiffs — including Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and each of the 15 county recorders — to take no action implementing or enforcing the new law&#8217;s provisions in a way that would affect voting in the Nov. 8 general election. Bolton further ordered that no action could be taken on the law until at least Jan. 1, 2023, clarifying that the injunction later could be lengthened.</p>

Lawyers representing governor candidate Kari Lake and secretary of state hopeful Mark Finchem filed a notice saying they would ask the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to revive their lawsuit. The pair sued in April, repeating unfounded allegations that vote-counting machines are not secure. Named in the lawsuit is Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, the state&#8217;s top election official and the Democratic candidate for governor, and the majority Republican Maricopa County board of supervisors U.S. District Judge John Tuchi dismissed their lawsuit late last month, saying they lacked the right to sue because they failed to show any realistic likelihood of harm.  He also noted that their lawsuit must be brought in state, not federal, court and that it is too close to the election to upend the process. “The 2022 Midterm Elections are set to take place on November 8,” Tuchi wrote in his ruling. “In the meantime, Plaintiffs request a complete overhaul of Arizona’s election procedures.” “We are appealing because it is absolutely critical that we have a vote counting process that gives the public complete confidence in the process,” La Sota said in a statement.</p>

Jack Hennessy’s court<a href="https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Judge-denies-transfer-Bridgeport-primary-appeal-17428199.php"> challenge of his primary loss</a> for the 127th District will go forward. Just one day before Hennessy’s case was scheduled for a hearing, his successful challenger, Councilman Marcus Brown, lost his request to have the state Supreme Court decide whether Hennessy’s appeal was filed too late. “The motion to transfer is denied as the statute is not applicable to these proceedings,” Superior Court Judge Barry Stevens ruled. He reiterated that the hearing on Hennessy’s appeal will go forward as scheduled. Brown’s campaign manager, Thomas Gaudett, said the issue is still one the campaign can use on appeal if Stevens decides to order a new primary. Following a second recount, Brown was declared the winner of the primary by a vote of 573 to 571. The first recount was triggered when the initial vote count on Aug. 9 showed Brown, 31, holding a narrow five vote lead — 579 to 574 — over Hennessy, 71, the Park City’s current longest serving state lawmaker. Election officials named Hennessy the winner after the recount revealed that the nine-term lawmaker and former truck driver received 567 votes while Brown received 566. That recount, though, concluded with at least nine absentee ballots still missing. Brown then filed an appeal in Superior Court claiming that city election officials improperly lost possession of numerous absentee ballots; improperly allowed absentee ballots to co-mingle so that an improper count was made during the recount canvass; used a defective machine tabulator and certified the results of the recount while acknowledging the absence of at least nine absentee ballots.</p>
<p>Former Stamford Democratic Party chief John Mallozzi has been found<a href="https://ctexaminer.com/2022/09/12/stamford-democratic-chief-found-guilty-of-28-felonies-in-ballot-fraud-case/"> guilty of 28 Class D felonies stemming from a ballot fraud case</a>. Mallozzi was charged with forging absentee ballots in 2015. According to the trial record, 26 fraudulent absentee ballots were submitted to the town clerk’s office in a “scheme” involving Mallozzi and former Republican Town Clerk Donna Loglisci. The state, however, raised instances involving 14 voters, charging Mallozzi with 14 counts each of 2nd-degree forgery and false statement in absentee balloting. Mallozzi, 72, could be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison, or a fine that could total $140,000, or both. “By the defendant’s hand alone, 26 people could have had their civil right to vote extinguished,” Randolph said, reading his verdict into the record.</p>

Cook ruled that the law, the result of legislation that Democrats rammed through the General Assembly in less than three weeks this past June, violates a provision in Delaware’s constitution that spells out the circumstances under which a person is allowed to cast an absentee ballot. “Our Supreme Court and this court have consistently stated that those circumstances are exhaustive,” Cook wrote. “Therefore, as a trial judge, I am compelled by precedent to conclude that the vote-by-mail statute’s attempt to expand absentee voting &#8230; must be rejected.” While declaring vote by mail unconstitutional, Cook upheld the state’s new same-day voter registration law. Democratic lawmakers introduce the vote-by-mail bill after failing to win Republican support to amend the constitution. A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote by each chamber in two consecutive General Assemblies. The first leg of a constitutional amendment to eliminate limitations on absentee balloting cleared the legislature in 2020, after initially being defeated in the Democrat-controlled Senate, but the second leg failed to win the necessary majority in the Democrat-led House last year.</p>

The Board of State Canvasser had deadlocked 2-2 over whether or not to put the Promote the Vote 2022 (Proposal 2) on the ballot. Those opposing putting the measure before voters had argued petition language did not list everything in the constitution it would change or cancel – or in legal terms, “alter and abrogate.” Democratic board members and PTV argued that the board’s role in that vote was only toward approving signatures, not rehashing language that was approved months ago. The state Supreme Court agreed, as the majority opinion cited a 2012 case, Stand Up for Democracy v. Secretary of State, which held canvassers are “limited to determining the sufficiency of a petition’s form and content and whether there are sufficient signatures to warrant certification.” The court also concluded that PTV “would not abrogate any of the constitutional provisions identified by the challenger. The Board thus has a clear legal duty to certify the petition.” Among PTV’s provisions are nine days of early in-person voting; requiring state-funded absentee ballot drop boxes and postage for ballots and applications; and requiring military and overseas ballots be counted if postmarked by Election Day. The constitutional amendment would also bar harassing conduct while voting; allow donations to fund election operations if publicly disclosed; and allow voters to fill out a single absentee ballot application to vote in all future elections.</p>
<p>A federal lawsuit filed against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson calls for Michigan to<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/09/08/2020-michigan-election-lawsuit-likely-to-be-tossed-experts-say/65742489007/"> “re-run” the 2020 presidential election</a> over unproven and debunked claims of election fraud nearly two years after Michigan voters elected now-President Joe Biden by more than 150,000 votes. In the complaint, lawyers allege the election should not have been certified by the Board of State Canvassers due to the voting software used in some counties. The complaint lists as plaintiffs two west Michigan voters, the Macomb County Republican Party chapter, U.S. Taxpayers Party’s gubernatorial candidate Donna Brandenburg, a nonprofit known as Election Integrity Fund and Force, and Irving Township Clerk Sharon Olson. Olson was one of the clerks who handed over vote tabulators to a group now being investigated for illegally accessing voting machines, according to Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office. Specifically, the lawsuit states that since 24 counties use voting software not certified by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, election results in all of Michigan’s 83 counties should not have been certified. The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, asks a judge to invalidate the Board of State Canvassers&#8217; certification of the 2020 election and have the election take place again. It&#8217;s unclear how an election would be re-done in such a circumstance. U.S. District Court Judge Paul L. Maloney last week said attorneys for the grassroots coalition did not meet the requirements for a request for a<a href="https://www.macombdaily.com/2022/09/11/judge-denies-tro-in-macomb-gops-effort-to-toss-results-of-2020-presidential-election/"> temporary restraining order.</a> He said the challenge was likely to fail, according to his 7-page order. The group also has “not demonstrated any imminent irreparable harm or a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims,” the judge wrote.</p>

Schofield, the Republican Rensselaer County Board of Elections commissioner, was arrested by the FBI and charged with<a href="https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/Rensselaer-County-s-Republican-elections-17438122.php"> fraudulently obtaining and filing absentee ballots</a> last year using the personal information of at least eight voters without their permission, according to an indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court. The indictment charges Schofield with 12 felony counts of unlawful possession and use of a means of identification.  He declined comment as he left the courthouse with his attorney, Danielle Neroni, and the small group of supporters. Neroni said her client &#8220;continues to maintain his innocence.&#8221; The indictment accuses Schofield of using an online state Board of Elections portal to request absentee ballots on behalf of eight voters who had no interest in voting, did not request absentee ballots and didn&#8217;t know that Schofield was using their personal information to obtain the ballots. The indictment alleges the official &#8220;falsely certified&#8221; that he was the person requesting the ballot when he entered the voters&#8217; names and dates of birth in the portal. The ballots that were delivered to the Rensselaer County Board of Elections were subsequently filled out and submitted in last year&#8217;s primary election, the general election, and sometimes both. In some instances, documentation was completed falsely claiming the ballots were mailed to the voters at their residences.</p>

The Republican National Committee, state Republican Party and the Clay County GOP chairwoman sued the state board, the board members and its top administrator in Wake County court. They want a judge to declare the board is violating state law and the state and U.S. constitutions. The GOP plaintiffs contend that board Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell lacked authority last month to move the absentee ballot deadline from Nov. 11 — the federal and state Veterans Day holiday — to Nov. 14. State law says county election offices must receive civilian absentee ballots by the third day after Election Day — either in person or in the mail if the ballot was postmarked by Election Day, which is Nov. 8 this year. The lawsuit says the absentee ballot deadline law doesn’t specifically give the board authority to push back the deadline based on a legal holiday. The lawsuit says since 2016 board guidance or rules have required an at-large observer to work for at least four hours before they can be replaced at a voting site. The Republicans contend the requirement doesn’t align with state law and makes it hard for the party to fill volunteer gaps at voting sites and precincts by moving at-large observers to other locales.</p>
<p>Oral arguments over the constitutionality of North Carolina&#8217;s<a href="https://www.wunc.org/politics/2022-09-12/nc-supreme-court-hear-voter-id-arguments-next-month-22-election"> photo voter identification law</a> will be held next month, the state Supreme Court has decided.  In a 4-3 decision, the justices who are registered as Democrats agreed with attorneys for minority voters who had asked the state&#8217;s highest court in July to move the case along more quickly. These voters are plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in December 2018 moments after the Republican-controlled General Assembly approved a photo ID law. That law has never been administered. A panel of judges held a trial, and in September 2021 a majority struck down the law, saying it intentionally discriminated against Black voters. Earlier this year, in a similar 4-3 decision, the justices agreed to hear the case, instead of waiting for the intermediate-level Court of Appeals to deliberate first. The plaintiffs wrote in July that an expedited argument date as soon as September would help state officials and voters “prepare for future elections without the risk of voter confusion and disenfranchisement.” An order filed Friday and signed by Senior Associate Justice Robin Hudson granted the request, citing “the great public interest in the subject matter of this case, the importance of the issues to the constitutional jurisprudence of this state, and the need to reach a final resolution on the merits at the earliest possible opportunity.” The order said oral arguments would occur either the week of Oct. 3, or no later than Oct. 18. The scheduling means oral arguments now will occur weeks before elections for two of the seats on the Supreme Court currently held by Democrats. Hudson is retiring and Associate Sam Ervin IV is seeking reelection.</p>

The lawsuit asks Lehigh County Court to order the officials to follow state law and ensure that a person drops off only one ballot, unless authorized to deliver another for someone else. The county should do that, the suit says, by stationing people to monitor activity at its five ballot box locations. The lawsuit cites county District Attorney Jim Martin’s  investigation earlier this year that determined, based on video surveillance, at least 288 people deposited multiple ballots in the November 2021 election. The investigation was prompted by a complaint from the Lehigh County Republican Committee.  Three weeks before the May 17 primary, Martin, a Republican, announced that he would deploy county detectives and video surveillance of the five ballot box locations to make sure people didn’t turn in more than one ballot without authorization. The court filing mentioned that Martin’s action “achieved its goal as there were no reported cases of third-party delivery of ballots.”  Martin did not respond Friday to a request for comment about the accuracy of the lawsuit’s statement. Defendants are the county Election Board, comprising county Executive Phillips Armstrong, Jennifer Allen and Dennis Nemes. Other defendants are Timothy Benyo, the county’s top election official and chief clerk of the Election Board, and Diane Gordian, the board’s deputy chief clerk.</p>

Lincoln County agreed to keeping records relating to elections after the November 2020 Presidential election while also arguing they were not given enough time to respond to a lawsuit pertaining to said records. Pekas said Tuesday in a Minnehaha County Courtroom that he signed the motion based on the fact that the county and Lund had no prior notice that they would be served the lawsuit. The parties agreed to preserve records for elections from after the November 2020 election, so long as the records existed. The vacated order, filed by Joseph Meader, the deputy state&#8217;s attorney for Lincoln County, on Sept. 2, requested that they had only known about the lawsuit for two days before Pekas&#8217;s order on Sept. 1, requesting that all records on elections after the November 2020 be kept.  The order not only included Lincoln County but the other 65 counties in South Dakota. Meader added that jurisdictional issues could arise by including the counties.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/">National Voter Registration Day</a>: National Voter Registration Day is a nonpartisan civic holiday celebrating our democracy. First observed in 2012, it has quickly gained momentum ever since. Nearly 4.7 million voters have registered to vote on the holiday to date. Celebrated every September, National Voter Registration Day involves volunteers and organizations from all over the country hitting the streets in a single day of coordinated field, technology and media efforts. National Voter Registration Day seeks to create broad awareness of voter registration opportunities to reach tens of thousands of voters who may not register otherwise. According to U.S. Census data from 2020, as many as 1 in 4 eligible Americans are not registered to vote. Every year, millions of Americans find themselves unable to vote because they miss a registration deadline, don’t update their registration, or aren’t sure how to register. National Voter Registration Day wants to make sure everyone has the opportunity to vote. The holiday has been endorsed by the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED), the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and the National Association of Election Officials (The Election Center). <strong>When:</strong> September 20</p>
<p><a href="https://ucla.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_YAvPjQc-S3qWUjGokT7wUw">Special From the Frontlines:  The United States Supreme Court and American Democracy: View of Three Journalists</a>: The Safeguarding Democracy Project promotes research, collaboration, and advocacy under the leadership of UCLA Law Professor Richard L. Hasen; one of the nation&#8217;s leading election scholars. The Safeguarding Democracy Project is built upon the premise that tackling issues of the U.S. election integrity must be collaborative: across ideologies, across scholarly disciplines, and as a bridge between theory and practice. Moderated by Richard L. Hasen and featuring Joan Biskupic, Adam Liptak and Dahlia Lithwick. <strong>When:</strong> September 20, 12pm Pacific. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://philanthropynetwork.org/events/upcoming-us-supreme-court-cases-what-they-could-mean-redistricting-and-voting-rights">Upcoming U.S. Supreme Court Cases: What They Could Mean for Redistricting and Voting Rights</a>: State legislatures and redistricting commissions in every state except Montana have drawn new district maps. However, many states, particularly in the South where the absence of Section 5 coverage of the Voting Rights Act unleashed a torrent of racial gerrymandering efforts, still face legal challenges to the new lines. Starting in October, the U.S. Supreme Court will begin hearing three redistricting cases on appeal by state legislatures in Alabama, Louisiana, and North Carolina that could have profound implications for redistricting as well as voting rights. They are Merrill v. Milligan (Alabama); Ardoin v. Robinson (Louisiana); and Moore v. Harper (North Carolina). The Alabama and Louisiana cases present challenges to the Voting Rights Act. The North Carolina case presents a novel argument that under the U.S. Constitution, state courts do not have the ability to review redistricting actions by their state legislatures&#8211;even for compliance with state constitutions and laws. This theory would remove any state court check against illegal actions by state legislatures related to elections, making it easier for state politicians to suppress the vote, draw rigged maps, and cast doubt on election results. Presenters will explain the implications of these three important cases and discuss how advocates and funders around the country can engage in the fight for fair representation. Cosponsored by Fair Representation in Redistricting, State Infrastructure Fund, and Funders’ Committee for Civic Participation. <strong>When:</strong> September 22, 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cato.org/events/foia-government-transparency-report-card">FOIA and Government Transparency: A Report Card</a>: In the more than 50 years that the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has been on the books, it has helped revolutionize Americans’ understanding of how their government works in practice. But the agencies and departments of the executive branch that are covered by the FOIA have persistently attempted to thwart its effective implementation. The most recent statutory update to FOIA took place in 2016, and with several years of experience with the revised law behind us, it’s fair to ask: Is FOIA working better now? If not, why not? What is it like to battle federal agencies and departments weekly to pry loose information dealing with immigration policy, telecommunications policy, and the national security establishment? What additional changes to FOIA are needed to truly make the law work as intended? Join our expert panel as we discuss these and related issues. <strong>When:</strong> September 22 1pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/disinformation-midterms-and-mind-how-psychological-science-can-help-journalists-combat">Disinformation, Midterms, and the Mind: How psychological science can help journalists combat election misinformation</a>: Journalism and democracy have been upended by the growth of mis- and dis-information. Countering it effectively requires understanding why people are susceptible, targeted, and how they can become more resilient. Psychological research can teach journalists how to prebunk disinformation and convey credibility in ways that readers, viewers, and listeners can process, which is more essential than ever as November’s elections near. Register now to join the National Press Club Journalism Institute, the American Psychological Association, and PEN America for a free program on Thursday, Sept. 29 to learn how to use these strategies for coverage that informs and empowers your community as it prepares to vote and to discuss the ways disinformation has affected the practice of journalism. The program, which will be held on Zoom, will begin at 11:30 a.m. ET and be followed by a Q&amp;A session. <strong>When:</strong> September 29, 11:30am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online</p>
<p><a href="https://www.press.org/events/voter-accessibility-improving-your-election-coverage-people-disabilities">Voter Accessibility: Improving your election coverage for people with disabilities</a>:  Midterm elections are Nov. 8. Are you prepared to be a watchdog for disabled voters in your communities? What is your newsroom doing to ensure your election coverage is useful and accessible for disabled voters? How are you covering voter rights and accessibility leading up to and on Election Day?  More than 61 million Americans live with disabilities, yet they remain underrepresented in journalism produced by U.S. newsrooms. As a decisive midterm election approaches, recent coverage shows state and local measures intend to: reduce <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2022/08/19/u-s-doj-intervenes-on-behalf-of-disabled-voters-in-lawsuit-to-protect-absentee-ballot-assistance/">voting by absentee ballot</a>, <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2022/08/22/election-disability-experts-testify-as-trial-over-election-laws-enters-week-two/">limit access at polling locations</a>, and limit information explaining how people with disabilities can <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/07/26/voting-disabled-community-elections/10143455002/">cast their ballots</a>. Join the National Press Club Journalism Institute for a virtual discussion among experts in voter access, disability representation, and accessible news coverage on best practices to cover disabled voters and to highlight voting access issues they may face.  <strong>When:</strong> October 14, 11:30am Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://voteearlyday.org/">Vote Early Day</a>: Vote Early Day is a nonpartisan movement of media companies, businesses, nonprofits, election administrators, and creatives working to ensure all Americans have the tools to vote early. This holiday is a tentpole moment for partners of all stripes to engage with voters and urge them to cast their ballots. Created in 2020, Vote Early Day has brought thousands of national and local partners together in celebration and activation to increase the number of people voting early. This collaborative, open-source model—similar to Giving Tuesday and National Voter Registration Day—ensures that millions more Americans take advantage of their options to vote early through on the ground activations, get-out-the-vote pushes, national communications on traditional and social media, and efforts to create a new culture around voting. Vote Early Day plays a unique role in the push to get voters to cast their ballot. We are a trusted, nonpartisan holiday with supporters on both sides of the aisle. We provide a central moment for a wide range of partners (many non- traditional to the civic space) to engage with voters and urge them to vote early. Our collaboration of thousands of diverse partners allows us to engage in places beyond where voters are used to seeing election messages. This allows us to break through the noise and meet voters where they are. <strong>When:</strong> October 28</p>
