														<p><strong>Poll workers on the frontlines of democracy</strong><br />
<em>De-escalation tools available from a number of sources</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />
Electionline.org</p>
<p>Since the 2020 election, <a href="https://issueone.org/projects/facesofdemocracy/">election workers and officials</a> have faced <a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/2020-elections-oral-history-project">well-documented</a> threats to themselves and in some cases their families.</p>
<p>Now concerns are growing that poll workers, the front line of democracy, could face increased harassment or pressure from angry or frustrated voters and a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/15/rnc-election-integrity-trump-mcdaniel/">battalion of poll watchers</a> being recruited to find election irregularities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6255" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM-300x200.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM-768x512.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-06-at-6.04.54-AM.png 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />“State and local election officials face challenges every day related to cybersecurity, physical threats and harassment, and increasingly rampant mis- and disinformation, all of which make their job harder than ever before. These security challenges are interrelated and cannot be viewed in isolation, as the proliferation of false or misleading narratives about elections is a key contributing factor to our current heightened threat environment,” said former Washington Secretary of State<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2021/10/26/cisa-announces-appointment-washington-secretary-state-kim-wyman-senior-election"> Kim Wyman</a> who now serves<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"> CISA</a>’s Senior Election Security Lead.</p>
<p>Wyman said election officials across the country have reported challenges in recruiting and retaining poll workers for the fall elections.</p>
<p>“While some of this is certainly due to poll workers leaving service for traditional reasons, like retirement, election officials have shared concerns with us that the hostility and threats directed at election officials are a related cause for the shrinking staffing pool.  We will continue to stand in support of the election community,” Wyman said. “There are a<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/publication/de-escalation-series"> number of resources</a> for officials on CISA.gov, including on enhancing the physical security of election sites and their personnel.”</p>
<p>The<a href="https://bridgingdivides.princeton.edu/"> Bridging Divides Initiative</a> at Princeton University is a is a non-partisan research initiative that tracks and mitigates political violence in the United States. BDI has produced a<a href="https://bridgingdivides.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf246/files/documents/De-Escalation%20Guidance%20for%20Poll%20Workers.pdf"> series of de-escalation tools for poll workers</a>. De-escalation is a violence mitigation tool applicable in many different settings</p>
<p>According to Theo Sitther, De-escalation Project Lead at BDI, election officials are increasingly looking for mitigation tools and resources for poll workers in case they encounter disruptions during the election period. In turn, organizations focused on supporting the election process are increasingly interested in providing de-escalation training to poll workers and volunteers.</p>
<p>“We created the de-escalation guidance as a quick reference guide that poll workers can use to prepare for the midterm elections,” explained Sitther, “We work with all these organizations to ensure that the resources we produce are accessible to a bipartisan audience.”</p>

<p>BDI consulted with and worked in partnership with organizations specializing in election administration. Additionally, they  relied on pre-existing relationships with organizations that provide de-escalation training. For example, DC Peace Team, Nonviolent Peaceforce, and the Crime and Justice Institute are three of their close partners collaborating with BDI to produce de-escalation resources.</p>
<p>“We also consulted various partners who work more directly in the election space, including former election workers,” Sitther said. “We could share very real, lived experiences from the past year via our ongoing conversations with current officials. Many of them pointed us to different state resources we used to supplement and enrich our de-escalation guides.”</p>
<p>Moving forward, BDI is producing a state-by-state directory of organizations regularly providing de-escalation and bystander intervention training.</p>
<p>“Essentially, this directory will serve as a local listing of places to learn and receive experiential learning,” Sitther said. “With these resources, we hope to provide election workers at the local, state, and national levels with information on how to access de-escalation training in their home state or virtually.”</p>
<p><strong>Additional Resources</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/">The Elections Group</a> also has a<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/communications-resource-desk"> series of resources</a> available for election and poll workers including downloadable<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/communications-resource-desk/deescalation-posters"> de-escalation posters</a>.</p>

While early voting turnout was light, more than 400,000 residents requested mail ballots. This is great, except it presented an issue in Maryland because Maryland is the only state that requires local elections officials to wait until 10 am Thursday after the primary to begin<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/07/17/delayed-maryland-primary-results/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_local"> processing and counting mail ballots</a>. The General Assembly<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/07/20/hogan-delay-maryland-elections/"> attempted to change the law</a>, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.  “We’re used to, in most contests, knowing who the winner is when we go to bed,” Nikki Baines Charlson, deputy administrator at the Maryland State Board of Elections, told The Washington Post. “This election is different,” she said. “We’ve never had half a million people request a mail-in ballot.” While the results for some races were clear Tuesday night, it will be days, if not weeks before results are final. As for primary day itself, turnout was light but there were some issues. A<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-election-day-updates-20220719-sh6cvarkofgvzmmx4vdzug2yca-story.html"> lack of election judges</a>—some attributed to the midsummer primary—meant that some polling places in the state opened late on Tuesday.  Some voters complained about<a href="https://wjla.com/news/elections/maryland-primary-elections-2022-issues-problem-at-polls-polling-locations-july-19-mail-in-ballots-results-outcomes-races-winners-candidates-governor-comptroller-attorney-general-larry-hogan"> over-aggressive campaign workers</a> at polling places. A polling place that serves Baltimore’s Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood had to be moved to Harlem Park due to<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-ci-sandtown-poll-harlem-park-20220719-37x4fjlzjvdw5am6wdammcydbu-story.html"> vandalism</a> at the original location.<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/howard/cng-ho-cf-primary-elections-20220719-20220719-jrmpsws7f5ef5khijewgem2zwm-story.html"> Howard County</a> Election Director Guy Mickley said turnout for in-person voting seemed lower than in previous years, likely prompted by the ease of mail-in voting, which has been an option to any voter for any reason since 2020. Voters in<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/carroll/news/cc-election-20220719-2vwowxlu5rgyvfkwhwx7hr6yni-story.html"> Carroll County</a> said they voted in-person because they had concerns about mail voting. &#8220;Things have been very slow everywhere I&#8217;ve gone today,&#8221; said<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/slow-day-at-the-polls-in-baltimore-city-election-director-says/"> Baltimore City</a> Elections Director Jones. &#8220;It has been slow in talking to other directors around the state. It has been very slow, even during early voting, it has been real slow.&#8221;  The<a href="https://www.wmar2news.com/news/local-news/voter-escorted-out-of-polling-location-by-ambulance-due-to-heat"> paramedics</a> were called to one city polling place for a voter overcome by the heat.  Primary election results from all of Baltimore City&#8217;s 296 precincts are online Wednesday evening after a<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/all-baltimore-precincts-reporting-election-results-misplaced-thumb-drives/"> dozen misplaced thumb drives</a> caused a delay in the release of the tally. In other thumb drive news,<a href="https://www.somdnews.com/recorder/news/local/its-a-lock-calvert-experiences-glitch-on-election-night/article_a2cf2e85-ee45-52cd-8101-4bcabca906f8.html"> Calvert County</a>’s effort to be first in the state with election results hit a snag late Tuesday night with the discovery that a thumb-drive containing the tallies for one precinct was locked in a building that was no longer accessible until Wednesday, when the drive was retrieved. The Director of the<a href="https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/issues-at-maryland-polling-places-cause-frustration-for-voters"> Baltimore County</a> Board of Elections told Fox 45 despite testing everything they still had issues. Some of the concerns included election judges not showing up or needing assistance setting up polling places. One precinct didn’t have the “I voted” stickers and at another there were technology issues. In<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/harford/aegis/cng-ag-harford-voters-election-primary-2022-20220719-aw76gzqsynauvmzyfmkald2zbq-story.html"> Harford County</a>, first-time voter MacKenzie Tacka, voting in Tuesday’s primary election, told The Baltimore Sun, it wasn’t as bad as she expected. “I feel really adult now,” she said. “I feel like I finally got to do something for my country.” Despite initially feeling intimidated, she said everyone at her polling location, C. Milton Wright High School in Bel Air, was nice and helpful.</p>

Signs were posted over the weekend near ballot boxes in several Seattle-area locations, with red letters warning the boxes are &#8220;Under Surveillance&#8221; and saying that accepting money &#8220;for harvesting or depositing ballots&#8221; may violate federal law. A scannable code on the signs leads to the King County Republican Party website and a form encouraging people to submit “election incident” reports, including photos and video. Amber Krabach, a GOP activist told the Seattle Times, the signs were placed by volunteers “to act as a deterrent” to anyone getting paid to deliver ballots. “If they are legally dropping ballots into the box, then the sign shouldn’t bother them,” she said. King County Elections Director Julie Wise has asked the King County<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-seattle-washington-government-and-politics-226eecaafe338dc318ae2f57291c946c"> Sheriff’s office to investigate</a>. “I believe this is a targeted, intentional strategy to intimidate and dissuade voters from using secure ballot drop boxes. My team is not going to stand by and allow any group to seed fear and doubt amongst our residents and voters, especially not when they are simply trying to make their voices heard,” Wise said. King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg said in a statement issued by King County Elections that Washington law allows voters to drop off ballots for others. “Signs intended to make voters feel like they are being watched and monitored and violating the law by depositing ballots is voter intimidation, period,” Satterberg said.</p>

This report aims to improve the DOJ Election Threat Task Force’s effectiveness by urging the DOJ to release a guidance document for local law enforcement, FBI field offices, and others who work on the front lines of elections. The guidance document envisioned by BPC and ASD would discuss federal statutes the DOJ enforces related to election threats, statutes that prohibit the intimidation of election officials, and the department’s commitment to act against those who violate the law. From the report: “If the DOJ is to make a dent in improving election worker safety, it must demonstrate that it is both ready and willing to use its powers to investigate and prosecute election-related threats, while also seeking to collaborate with its partners at every turn. This additional guidance is an acknowledgement of that. And while it will not be a panacea for all the ongoing threats of violence being directed at election workers, it would certainly be a big step in the right direction.”</p>

In others, paid elections staff do it. It’s not really a newsmaker. Unless it’s in Hinds County, Mississippi where<a href="https://www.wlbt.com/2022/07/14/county-leaders-odds-over-who-will-deliver-election-machines-this-november/"> the fight over who will deliver the machines</a> has been gaining steam. The controversy<a href="https://www.wlbt.com/2021/10/27/election-commissioner-questions-procedures-bringing-contractor-deliver-voting-machines/"> stretches back to at least late 2021</a> when the county hired one contractor over another to deliver the equipment for a special election. When the company hired to deliver for the special election in 2021<a href="https://www.wapt.com/article/days-before-election-hinds-county-voting-machines-sent-to-wrong-location/38095541"> had issues</a>, the county had to bring in another company to complete the job properly. Then there was an issue<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/voting-machine-vendor-wont-paid-205320586.html"> paying the new vendor</a>. Most recently, County Administrator Kenny Wayne Jones said he wants to bring the delivery of the equipment in-house citing budget concerns. Elections commissioners, though, questioned whether Jones had the authority to take over the service without consulting the board of supervisors. They also questioned whether county workers had the training they needed to do the work. At a meeting of the county board of supervisors this week<a href="https://www.wlbt.com/2022/07/18/fireworks-erupt-over-who-will-deliver-voting-machines-november-election/">, heated words were exchanged</a>, but a solution may be in sight. District 2 Supervisor David Archie told Jones not to go to the commissioners again without first getting the board’s approval to do so. “Stay from down at the election commissioners’ office&#8230; You have no business down there dealing with any elections. That’s not your job, that’s not your authority,” he said. “Your job is to carry out our wishes here on this board.” Jones said part of his job was to save the county money. No vote was taken by the board regarding moving the deliveries in-house. Jones told WLBT that he would put an item on the agenda for the board to consider at its next meeting later this month. “I’m doing what’s in the best interest of the county,” Jones said, “but at the end of the day, if they want a vote, they will get on in two weeks.” We’ll keep you posted!</p>

State Board of Elections has denied a Republican Party <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/State_Board_Meeting_Docs/2022-06-09/Request%20for%20a%20Declaratory%20Ruling%20from%20NCSBE%20(5-14-22).pdf">request</a> that the board<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/news/2022/07/14/nc-elections-board-rejects-republican-signature-check-motion"> authorize county elections officials to scrutinize signatures</a> on absentee voting documents, citing concerns that the proposal would create unequal standards across counties. “We’ve got an extraordinarily secure absentee ballot process now, and to do this would introduce a level of uncertainty where some voters might be treated different than other voters depending on how they vote,” Chair Damon Circosta said. Challenging the board’s prior guidance discouraging signature matching, the proposal would permit county boards of elections to compare signatures on absentee ballot request forms and return envelopes with the signatures included in voter registration records. The board rejected the request in a 3-2 party-line vote, with three Democrats voting against signature verification and two Republicans voting in favor. After the GOP submitted its request in May, the board held a written public comment period from June 10 to July 5, receiving more than 8,000 responses. Supporters of the request urged the board to strengthen election security before the November elections, when a few hundred votes could be the tipping point in several close races. But voting rights advocates warned the proposal could disenfranchise disabled and elderly voters whose signatures might have changed since they registered to vote.</p>

The panel testified that many of the cybersecurity, disinformation and resource challenges election administrators have long faced still present in 2022 with the additional challenge of insider threats posed by actors inside government and threats to elections officials. Cybersecurity measures, staffing challenges, financial resources and stronger relationships with law enforcement were all tossed about during the nearly three-hour hearing, with many speakers noting the strain the threat landscape has placed on election administrators nationwide. LaRose also said that federal agencies like CISA can be speedier in “declassifying what can be declassified.” Toulouse Oliver agreed. “We want to be aware as soon as possible of any potential vulnerabilities. We need that information yesterday, not tomorrow,” she said, noting that over her six years in office, people in the election community are “getting so much better at sharing data with each other.” “The information flow has gotten a lot better,” LaRose said later in the hearing. “They’ve been purposeful about that. There’s a variety of services down to the county level.” Toulouse Oliver and Elizabeth Howard of New York University’s Brennan Center for Law and Justice both said that election officials could benefit from more federal funding, in addition to the cyber and physical security resources provided through CISA. LaRose said more funds are “appreciated,” but often come with restrictions and paperwork grants that make them “less effective.” In a wide-ranging hearing that also touched on election workers’ compensation, bulk mail from third-party groups and the effectiveness of voter ID, the threats posed by misinformation and disinformation remained close to the surface. Some members used their question time to repeat conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. The election officials who testified said they are making efforts to address the conspiracy theories that continue to be fueled by bad information on social media.</p>

Doug Ducey has signed House Bill 2243 into law after vetoing a similar bill in late May. Both bills call on county recorders to<a href="https://arizona.votebeat.org/2022/7/13/23211624/hb2243-arizona-voter-registration-removals-naturalized-citizens"> compare voter rolls</a> to other databases and sources, like driver’s licenses in other states, death records, and jury questionnaires. According to VoteBeat, In a letter explaining his veto of the original legislation, Ducey pointed to a provision of the bill that required recorders to cancel voter registrations if they received information that the voter wasn’t a qualified elector. He said that provision was vague and could result in “bad actors” falsely asserting someone wasn’t qualified to vote in Arizona. The new version says recorders must “obtain,” rather than “receive and confirm,” information that indicates someone isn’t eligible to vote. That change partly addresses the issue, said Jon Sherman, the litigation director for the Fair Elections Center, because it leaves discretion to the administrators to proactively investigate ineligible voters rather than forcing them to act on outside tips.  A spokesman for Ducey said he signed the second bill because the changes addressed his concerns about due process.</p>

That provision, which states that “no elections shall be held to be invalid due to any irregularity or failure in the preparation or forwarding of any mail-in ballots,” was at the center of an election contest over a 2020 county commissioner race in Atlantic County. Judges in New Jersey interpret election law with deference to voter enfranchisement and ballot access. The broad latitude given to jurists in such cases can, at times, lead to decisions that directly conflict with the letter of the law. “It’s all on the books, but then judges kind of have carte blanche to do what they want,” said Michael Suleiman, the Atlantic County Democratic chairman.</p>

The resolution, Resolution 2023-07, was tabled when Lincoln County Clerk Whitney Whitaker instead urged Commissioners to rewrite the resolution to &#8220;support the county clerk.&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe this particular resolution as it&#8217;s written really identifies or captures the needs of Lincoln County or its concerns,&#8221; Whitaker said to Commissioners. Whitaker said passage of the proposed resolution would imply issues with local elections when, she said, &#8220;we are very confident in our election process.&#8221; The Commission instead agreed to rewrite the resolution with input from Whitaker, with the hopes of creating a document that might be useful in lobbying for changes to New Mexico&#8217;s voter laws in the 60-day session in 2023. Resolutions hold no weight of law, instead are statements of position of the governing body.</p>

Kathleen Winn, a Republican running for a House seat in Arizona’s 6th Congressional District, filed the suit July 11, days after Pinal County elections staff discovered that they had mailed out ballots with errors to an estimated 63,000 voters. In an effort to fix the error, affected voters to cast a supplemental ballot for municipal elections, same as in the previous version of the fix. But now, voters will be able to cast those ballots by mail or at the polls on Election Day. They still would use their original ballots to vote in other contests. Winn&#8217;s complaint states that Pinal County elections staff lacks the authority to send out a supplemental ballot. It cites a previous court case from 2020 between a conservative political nonprofit and former Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes. In that case, Fontes had put instructions on voter pamphlets describing how voters should correct mistakes on their ballots. He asked voters to cross out mistakes on their ballots for the November election.</p>

The judge found the suit wasn’t filed in the correct jurisdiction. An attorney for Jody Harris asked for the suit to be transferred to Crawford County, but the judge denied the request. Harris&#8217; attorney plans to appeal the case to the state supreme court. Harris was leading the race late in the night while ballots were still being counted, according to the lawsuit. The commissioners had decided to count the absentee ballots last. Arkansas law requires that absentee ballots be counted before the polls close. Rep. Bruce Coleman was seen talking to Bill Coleman outside the door of the central count location at this time, according to the lawsuit. Bill Coleman indicated the election commission would pack up for the day and count the absentee ballots later, according to the lawsuit. A poll watcher insisted that the commission count the absentee ballots that night. Coleman and the commission relented, left the count center and went to another building. When they returned, Coleman said the commission had found thirteen absentee ballots that had been cast and not counted.</p>

In two briefs, the attorneys took aim at a March 31 ruling by Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker, who backed voting-rights groups in a challenge to parts of the law and wrote that Florida “has repeatedly, recently, and persistently acted to deny Black Floridians access to the franchise.” Lawyers for Secretary of State Cord Byrd, Attorney General Ashley Moody and county elections supervisors said in a 67-page brief Monday that Walker “got it wrong” and that the measure (SB 90) is a “facially neutral and common-sense election law.” “The record shows the Florida Legislature attempting to balance integrity with access to improve voter confidence, provide clear rules, and address issues before they affected Florida’s election,” the brief filed at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said. A panel of the Atlanta-based appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments Sept. 15 in the case. After Walker found parts of the law unconstitutional, the appeals court in May issued a stay of his ruling – effectively allowing the law to be in effect during this year’s elections.</p>

Meanwhile, defenders of the law passed last year said it protects voters from attempts to influence their decisions in the moments before they cast their ballots, especially after food trucks parked outside polling places during the 2020 presidential election and U.S. Senate runoffs. U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee questioned whether the goal of voting organizations was truly nonpartisan. An email presented in court showed the group Vote.org describing the food trucks as “our last chance to reach Georgians before they vote.” “Are they helping someone because they’re thirsty, or because they want to determine control of the U.S. Senate?” Boulee asked. Under the law, no one can distribute food and drinks to a voter who is in line, within 25 feet of a line or within 150 feet of the outer edge of a polling place. Food and water could be distributed outside those boundaries, and poll workers are allowed to set up self-service water receptacles. At one point, Boulee asked whether giving out filet mignon to voters would go too far, a point that an attorney for the plaintiffs agreed with. Distributing steaks would send a different message to voters than giving them pretzels and peanuts, said the attorney, Davin Rosborough. The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction that would invalidate the restrictions on handing out food and drinks during this November’s elections. Boulee could rule in the coming weeks.</p>

The Kansas Court of Appeals declined last month to block the law, which criminalizes impersonation of an election official, among other things. The court ruled the plaintiffs lacked the standing to challenge the unconstitutionality of this law because they did not demonstrate their work was harmed by this provision. But voting rights groups say they have paused voter registration work for the past year because of the law. In deciding to appeal the decision, the groups argued someone would need to be “arrested, charged, tried, convicted, and sentenced to prison” before they could challenge the law under the appeals court majority opinion. “Kansas voters rely on the league for important election information every year and currently the league in Kansas has paused all in-person voter registration activities, even ahead of our August primary elections,” said Jacqueline Lightcap, co-president of the League of Women Voters of Kansas. “In a critical election year, we need the court to strike down the law and make it clear that volunteer organizations can register voters without the threat of criminal or civil penalties.” The League of Women Voters of Kansas is joined by Loud Light, Kansas Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, and the Topeka Independent Living Resource Center in the appeal. The lawsuit filed by the same groups last year challenged other elements of the bill as well, including limitations on who can deliver an advanced mail ballot and signature verification.</p>

The Court of Claims suit is asking for an injunction so that “none of the voting machines in the state” can be used “for another election” and should be replaced with paper ballots beginning with the August primary. Wilson also seeks an order that requires Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Elections Director Jonathan Bratter to “preserve all Nov. 3, 2020, general election” documents as well as provide him with correspondence relating to the certification of the electronic voting machines. Wilson claims that he submitted a Freedom of Information Act request in December concerning the certification of the 2020 election and he paid the state’s required 50% deposit that totaled nearly $660. However, Wilson claims the SOS office has not filled the request.</p>

Those experts include a Harvard-educated consultant and a retired Texas A&amp;M University math professor. But their opinions, according to their declarations, centered primarily on a 37-page analysis prepared by Edward Solomon, who has no math degree.</p>

Brian Ames filed a complaint with the Ohio Supreme Court on July 8, two days after early in-person voting began for the Aug. 2 primary. The complaint asserts that Ames has the &#8220;clear legal right to face election by the same voters he would have faced in the May 3 election.&#8221; Ames is asking Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose to direct boards of elections to challenge voters who request a ballot other than the one they voted in May. He said if the court rules in his favor, he will also ask the court to order a new primary election.  &#8220;I&#8217;m getting phone calls saying that I was going to ruin everything,&#8221; Ames said. &#8220;I said I think it&#8217;s pretty much ruined already.&#8221;  A separate primary for state elections isn&#8217;t normal, but delays in drawing new district maps for these some pushed the primary out of May and into August.</p>

The postmaster, Robert Weisenbach, can proceed with his libel lawsuit against Project Veritas, the conservative activist news organization that reported the unproven claims against him in November 2020 — claims that drew Erie into the national frenzy over the results of the presidential race and Donald Trump&#8217;s attempt to overturn his defeat. Piccinini has ruled against the preliminary objections of Project Veritas and the other two defendants, allowing Weisenbach&#8217;s suit to advance to the next stage, the evidence-gathering process known as a discovery, which includes depositions. Piccinini ruled against Project Veritas; its founder, James O&#8217;Keefe; and Richard Hopkins, the now former postal employee who was the source of the claims against Weisenbach.</p>

Jennifer Orten, of Draper, and Sophie Anderson, of Salt Lake City, brought the lawsuit after multiple records requests across various Utah counties were denied. Pullan pulled the plug on the women’s lawsuit—they sued Utah, Juab and Millard counties in March—after hearing arguments during a motion to dismiss hearing Wednesday. The hearing was spurred by Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson’s office, which filed a motion to dismiss in May. Chad Shattuck, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, attempted to convince the judge the ladies’ efforts were part of the Constitution’s checks and balances tradition, whereby the public is the sovereign and government officials the servants. Pullan called the attorney’s argument “extraordinary.”  “You assert on behalf of two voters the right to see ballot images of every other voter? That’s extraordinary,” the judge said.</p>
