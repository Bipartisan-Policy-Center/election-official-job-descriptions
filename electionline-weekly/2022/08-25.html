							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>The Elections Group launches its Communications Resource Desk ahead of  2022 General Election</strong></p>
<p>By<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/"> The Elections Group</a></p>
<p>Free service provides direct and customizable communications support and resources for election officials</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7828" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TheElectionsGroup-300x136.png" alt="" width="300" height="136" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TheElectionsGroup-300x136.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TheElectionsGroup-768x349.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TheElectionsGroup.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Election officials are incredibly busy. They are accustomed to wearing several hats, including everything from administering safe and secure elections in an evolving landscape to addressing legislative changes. With the rise of mis- and dis-information, election officials – already low on both time and resources in many cases – are now being asked to be communications professionals and public information officers to effectively respond to growing communications needs.</p>
<p>In response to this increased responsibility placed on election officials throughout the country, we launched our<a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/communications-resource-desk"> Communications Resource Desk</a> to help election offices tackle this newest challenge. For jurisdictions that may not have the capacity or ability to hire a dedicated communications professional – or for offices that are otherwise limited in their communications resources – the Communications Resource Desk aims to provide direct assistance to equip election professionals with the tools necessary to effectively respond to the demand for increased public communication.</p>
<p>The Elections Group team works as the “communications back office” in collaboration with election officials to develop high-level communication tools necessary for effective storytelling. The communications resources created as a part of this collaboration provide direct support, in real-time, to state and local election officials, but also build a pathway toward a sustainable, long-lasting, positive impact within the election administration community nationwide.</p>
<p>The work completed as a part of this project will help inform the types of readymade communications tools and templates that are available for download in the future. Additionally, the support and resources provided foster positive community relationships, and reiterate the safety and security of election infrastructure and processes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8760" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-25-at-10.04.00-AM-267x300.png" alt="" width="267" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-25-at-10.04.00-AM-267x300.png 267w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-25-at-10.04.00-AM.png 538w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" />Working with the Communications Resource Desk is a simple and quick process – designed with election officials’ busy schedules in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong> – Interested state and local election officials should visit<a href="http://www.electionsgroup.com/communications-resource-desk"> www.electionsgroup.com/communications-resource-desk</a> and click “Request Assistance” to be taken directly to our intake form.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong> – Once our team receives a request, we schedule a meeting to discuss the initial request, learn more about the office, and discuss communications support needs.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong> – Following the initial conversation, our team develops an initial draft or design concepts depending on the type and scope of the project.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4</strong> – Our team will then finalize designs and concepts based on any feedback provided from the office, and will send final versions of the products created along with suggested use instructions as needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The defining feature that makes the Communications Resource Desk unique is that services, resources and support are designed specifically for election officials by election officials. We have a team of former election officials and election communications professionals who are ready to assist. Resources include informational posters, infographics, public-facing handouts and palm cards, as well as scripts and presentation materials for community and stakeholder engagement.</p>
<p>Those who are simply looking for inspiration – or need some help getting started but don&#8217;t want or need direct support – can download any of our readymade templates that are easy to edit. Additionally, our communications team has been engaging directly with state and local election offices to address specific communication needs and collaborate with election offices to create customized materials. Election officials who are interested in taking advantage of any of these free resources are encouraged to visit<a href="http://www.electionsgroup.com/communications-resource-desk"> www.electionsgroup.com/communications-resource-desk</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Elections Group is a nonpartisan consulting firm that partners with state and local election officials to support new program implementation or improve existing processes.</em></p>

There were some scattered issues in The Sunshine State, but overall, Florida, once the butt of elections jokes, pulled off a<a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/elections/fl-ne-elex-aug-23-election-turnout-20220823-dfgwjyljrjdlrhtrxmgn2jevye-story.html"> relatively smooth primary</a>, even with new laws in place. “We are again the example for the nation on having results and having results timely, which increases confidence – which is our goal,” Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd<a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-secretary-of-state-boasts-safe-and-secure-elections-after-primary/"> said</a>. One<a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2022/08/23/jacksonville-beach-polling-location-opens-45-minutes-late-after-worker-couldnt-access-equipment/"> Duvall County</a> polling place opened about 45 minutes late when a poll worker was unable to access the voting equipment. Several polling places in<a href="https://www.gainesville.com/story/news/2022/08/23/alachua-county-republicans-call-shortage-ballots-voter-suppression/7880024001/"> Alachua County</a> reported running lot or out of ballots on Tuesday. In<a href="https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2022/08/23/orange-co--voters-drop-off-mail-in-ballots-at-supervisor-of-elections-office-ahead-of-election-day"> Orange County</a>, many people who chose to vote-by-mail dropped their ballots off at drop-off locations instead of using the Postal Service. Results reporting was delayed in<a href="https://www.wcjb.com/2022/08/24/columbia-county-report-election-night-reporting-issues-resolved/"> Columbia County</a> due to a database system issue. The biggest issue coming out of New York was<a href="https://queenseagle.com/all/2022/8/23/just-annoying-queens-voters-cast-ballots-in-second-primary-election-this-year"> low turnout</a>. Due to an ongoing battle over redistricting, like Ohio, New York was forced to hold two primary elections. Some voters did complain about<a href="https://bronx.news12.com/redistricting-leads-to-polling-place-confusion-for-august-primary"> confusion over redistricting</a>, but overall, it was a relatively quiet day in The Empire State.</p>

In<a href="https://apnews.com/article/kansas-abortion-vote-recount-e874f56806a9d63b473b24580ad7ea0c"> Kansas</a>, where advocates had paid for a recount of a ballot amendment on abortion, and nine of the state’s 105 counties recounted their ballots with the results remaining the same. Johnson County, the most populous in Kansas, faced the biggest recounting challenge because it had the most ballots. It pulled in workers from different departments to help. The sorting process took so long that the actual counting didn’t begin until Thursday afternoon. “This is almost like doing an Ironman triathlon and having to add on another marathon at the end,” said Fred Sherman, the county’s Election Commissioner. “So it is quite a gargantuan process.” In<a href="https://www.wbko.com/2022/08/25/ky-secretary-state-talks-cons-recounts/"> Kentucky</a>, Secretary of State Michael Adams again spoke out about unnecessary recounts and the impact they could have on the commonwealth. “There’s real harm to the taxpayers with these frivolous recounts, even if the petitioners pony up some money to help cover it,” he said. “There’s still a misuse of government resources in those situations. What we also want to avoid is these recounts dragging on and on and disrupting the ability of our clerks to prepare for November.” In<a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/david-blair-recount-maryland-primary-election-montgomery-county-executive-race-marc-elrich-germantown-vote-margin-provisional-ballots-board-of-elections-boe-mistake-workers-early-voting-final-count-tally"> Maryland</a>, the Montgomery County Board of Elections completed a hand recount of the county executive office in which the final vote tally was slightly altered, but the original winner was certified as the final winner. In<a href="https://www.wilx.com/2022/08/24/ingham-county-orders-recount-meridian-township-ballot-proposal/"> Michigan</a>, Ingham County has ordered Meridian Township to conduct a recount of a marijuana-related ballot proposal. “Recounts are a mechanism in state election law that allows a voter to verify the results by requesting a hand retally of the votes cast in an election,” Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum stated. “I will ensure that this recount is conducted in a smooth and timely fashion and that every ballot is counted and recorded under the methods prescribed by the law.”</p>

This week the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED) and the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) announced that they are<a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/aba-calls-on-legal-professionals-to-step-up-and-serve-as-poll-workers"> renewing their collaboration with the American Bar Association</a> to recruit ABA members to serve as poll workers. “We’re calling on lawyers and law students to step up this November to serve as poll workers,” said ABA President Deborah Enix-Ross. “Every day lawyers work to protect the rule of law and the Constitution, so it makes sense that they would be essential for us to have a free and fair election.”  As part of the initiative, NASS, NASED and ABA have created a<a href="https://vimeo.com/740480278/f19f14ee00"> video</a> encouraging lawyers and law students to become poll workers. Additionally,<a href="https://people.com/politics/celebrities-public-figures-help-alleviate-2022-poll-worker-shortage/"> Power to the Polls has relaunched</a> for the 2022 general election and recently announced the recruitment of more than 50,000 potential poll workers. &#8220;Recruiting 50,000 new potential poll workers is a huge milestone in this effort – and we’re looking forward to signing up the next 50,000, so every person who wants to cast their ballot this election can do so,” said Jane Slusser, Program Manager at Power the Polls. &#8220;Thanks to the energy and commitment from all of our partners as well as Americans excited to help their communities this election season, we are well on the way toward ensuring a safe and accessible election – but we can’t stop now. With fewer than 80 days until the general election, we need all hands on deck to help recruit a new generation of poll workers who will power elections to come.”</p>

The exercise, which was not in response to any specific or credible threat, took place August 17 – 19.  It included a range of hypothetical scenarios affecting election operations, giving participants the opportunity to share practices around cyber and physical incident planning, preparedness, identification, response, and recovery.</p>
<p>Following the exercise, CISA Director Jen Easterly, and members of the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council Executive Committee, including U.S. Election Assistance Commission Chairman Thomas Hicks, NASS President and New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way, NASED President and Administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission Meagan Wolfe, and Escambia County (Florida) Supervisor of Elections David Stafford issued the following joint statement:</p>
<p>“The nation’s election officials face a range of challenges, including cyber and physical risks to their infrastructure, and false election information that weaken voters’ trust in the process.  In the face of this dynamic environment, the election community works closely together to ensure the American people can be confident in the security and resilience of the 2022 elections. “This week’s exercise was just one of the many examples of the year-round coordination taking place among the federal government, state and local election officials, and the private sector to prepare for the 2022 general election. In addition to Tabletop the Vote, many jurisdictions and states have also held exercises throughout the year.</p>
<p>“All 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and thousands of local jurisdictions share and receive threat information through multiple channels, including the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC).  Rigorous safeguards are in place to ensure the cyber and physical security of election equipment, and procedures and protocols are continuously improved to further identify, respond to, and recover from potential incidents.</p>
<p>“We remain committed to election security and to supporting election officials, government and industry partners, and others who serve on the front lines of our democracy.”</p>
<p>The fifth annual Tabletop the Vote included participants from the federal government, including CISA, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of Defense, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, U.S. Department of Justice, National Security Agency, National Guard Bureau, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General and U.S. Postal Inspection Service. State and local officials from across the country also participated, as well as more than a dozen election security industry partners. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas delivered opening remarks on Wednesday and CISA Director Jen Easterly addressed participants virtually on Friday.</p>
<p>CISA has a number of resources and tools for election officials available on<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/election-security"> its website</a>.</p>

The municipal clerk manages the city’s elections, is in charge of administering Assembly meetings and records and oversees business licensing. Under current city law, the Assembly selects the municipal clerk, a nonpartisan position serving at the pleasure of the Assembly. Bronson introduced the proposal late last year, following an acrimonious debate and public testimony over changes to the city’s election laws that the Assembly passed. The mayor said that if the municipal clerk became an elected official, public trust and accountability would increase. Bronson’s ordinance, if approved by the Assembly, would send his suggestion to change the city’s charter to Anchorage voters for approval or rejection. In advance of the scheduled vote, Assembly leadership released a statement opposing the ordinance, saying the switch could impact the clerk’s office negatively, potentially diminishing the ethics, expertise and efficiency of the clerk’s office and add a layer of political pressure to the municipal clerk’s position. To pass the ordinance and send the proposal to voters, eight of the 12 Assembly members would need to vote in favor of it. If that happens, then voters would cast their ballots to decided whether the clerk should become an elected official in an upcoming election. The Assembly killed the proposal on a<a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/08/24/anchorage-assembly-kills-bronson-effort-to-make-top-election-job-more-political/"> 9-3 vote</a>.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-8756" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/SanClementeCA.png" alt="" width="193" height="167" />San Clemente, California</strong>: Councilmember Steve Knoblock’s attempt for the city to persuade the California State Legislature to improve<a href="https://www.sanclementetimes.com/council-votes-down-resolution-calling-on-lawmakers-for-additional-election-security-practices/"> election security</a> was voted down, 3-2, by the San Clemente City Council. Knoblock and Councilmember Laura Ferguson voted in favor of passing the resolution that meant to “enhance the confidence of the voting public in election outcomes” through adding a series of measures to the California Election Code, such as voter identification requirements. The failed resolution claimed that the use of ballot drop boxes “creates a higher level of risk for voter fraud”—a similar refrain commonly used by staunch supporters of former President Donald Trump to back his unfounded claims of mass voter fraud. It went on to implore legislators to adopt five measures to “restore and maintain” the public’s faith in the election process such as requiring voters to provide a valid form of photo identification or submit an affidavit of proof that they are the person on the registration rolls. The other measures recommended included the removal of inactive voters from voter rolls prior to the immediate next election, prohibiting unsupervised ballot drop boxes, enhancing the chain of custody process for vote by mail, and performing post-election audits.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6876" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BoulderCO-300x214.png" alt="" width="300" height="214" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BoulderCO-300x214.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BoulderCO-768x547.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BoulderCO.png 958w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Boulder, Colorado</strong>: The Boulder city council approved three municipal ballot measures for the November 8th ballot including a measure that would move<a href="https://www.dailycamera.com/2022/08/18/boulder-city-council-gives-initial-ok-to-three-november-ballot-measures/"> municipal elections to even numbered years</a>. According to The Daily Camera, the proposal to move city council elections to even-numbered years has sparked its share of controversy. Proponents of the bill have argued it could make voting easier to access for people of color, young voters and other groups who may be less likely to turn out to vote on off years, while opponents have said having local elections on the same years as national elections might distract voters from local issues. The proposal was previously modified because of feedback from the Boulder County Clerk’s office and the bill’s opponents. Now, if the measure passes, municipal elections will change to even-numbered years starting in 2026. The change also enables ranked-choice voting for mayor beginning in 2023. City Council members agreed to change the ordinance language to reflect that the even-year November election date would be the same as for the statewide election, and also to clarify when a mayor’s term ends. The council preliminarily approved the amended measure on a 6-3 vote.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3778" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/LuzerneCoPA-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/LuzerneCoPA-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/LuzerneCoPA-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/LuzerneCoPA.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Luzerne County, Pennsylvania</strong>: The majority of the Luzerne County Council voted against an ordinance that would have stopped the use of county staff and resources to deliver<a href="https://www.timesleader.com/news/1571294/luzerne-county-council-majority-rejects-drop-box-ordinance"> mail ballot drop boxes</a> to sites approved by the county’s independent citizen election board. Councilman Stephen J. Urban, who proposed the ordinance, had contemplated asking his colleagues to remove the ordinance from the voting agenda so he could tweak the wording. However, he did not make that motion. It does not appear he would have had majority support to delay a decision. Urban said before the meeting he wanted to add wording preventing election board members from holding the county liable if they delivered the boxes on their own. He had said board movement of the mailbox-style boxes would have been allowable because the board ultimately has authority over deciding whether boxes are used. Councilmember Tim McGinley said the ordinance would “infringe” on the authority of the county manager and election board. The county ended up spending more than $130,000 on litigation over the placement of the county district attorney’s race on the ballot last year and ended up with no legal resolution, in part because the county would have had to spend more money on legal fees to advance the matter through adjudication, he said.</p>

According to Mayor Herman Reid, the reasons for the Town of Star City’s requests for a change in their municipal election calendar were twofold. First, aligning the elections would allow Monongalia County Clerk’s Office to administer it at a cost savings of $5,000. Next, Reid hopes aligning the elections would increase voter participation. If the measure passes, the Town of Star City will make adjustments to the terms of elected officials to align with the 2024 General Election. This would include one year terms that would be up for a vote in 2023 that would later be adjusted in 2024, so the term limits for officials would align with bi-annual elections. The change would allow for a clean transition to prevent complications for the Monongalia County Clerk’s Office.</p>

The ordinance was approved as a charter ordinance, meaning an ordinance that enacts, amends or repeals a previous charter. The charter ordinance does not go into effect for another 60 days after approval, pending potential referenda requests on issues that may arise and potential revisions to the ordinance. Caledonia had been an outlier with having its clerk be elected; the vast majority of other municipalities have their clerks hired.</p>

Blanchard filed the request last week in Montgomery County Circuit Court. It does not state a reason. The motion said the other plaintiffs would proceed with the case and that her withdrawal at this stage would have no negative or prejudicial effect. The remaining plaintiffs in the case are state Rep. Tommy Hanes, a Republican from Jackson County, Dr. David Calderwood of Madison County, and Focus on America, a tax-exempt social welfare organization in DeKalb County. The lawsuit claims that the electronic voting systems used in Alabama are susceptible to tampering and hacking and cannot be trusted to give accurate results. The plaintiffs have asked for a preliminary injunction to block the state from using the electronic ballot-scanning machines in the election on Nov. 8. They asked the court to order a hand count of ballots under a procedure that would include video cameras live-streaming and recording the count. Defendants in the case are Secretary of State John Merrill, who serves as the state’s top election official, and the five members of Alabama’s Electronic Voting Committee, a panel created to inspect and certify the voting machines.</p>

The American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska, Native American Rights Fund, and Perkins Coie filed the complaint in Anchorage Superior Court on behalf of two Alaska voters, the League of Women Voters of Alaska and Arctic Village Council. The complainants noted that 7,468 ballots were rejected from Alaska’s first all by-mail election, or 4.5% of the total votes cast, with a greater proportion of those rejected ballots coming from parts of the state where Alaska Natives make up a majority of the population. The leading cause of rejection was for “improper or sufficient witnessing,” a requirement that was temporarily waived in 2020 by the Alaska Supreme Court during that year’s election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Voters not signing the envelope or failing to provide a correct identifier were also found to be “common mistakes.” The Municipality of Anchorage has a “ballot curing” process but he state of Alaska doesn’t have ballot curing provisions written in state statute. The plaintiffs argue that without a chance to fix their ballots, Alaskans are being disenfranchised and effectively having their constitutional due process rights violated. The<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22187075-2022-08-23-complaint-1?responsive=1&amp;title=1"> 28-page complaint</a> describes how a statewide system could operate, including informing voters about problems with their ballots ahead of Election Day so they can cast a questioned ballot or telling them to submit an affidavit by mail with missing voter information.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5463" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AZ-Flag2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong> Voting advocacy groups sued Arizona to block a new law that could criminalize volunteers or organizations who<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/08/19/voting-groups-fight-to-block-law-that-can-criminalize-arizona-voter-registration/"> provide registration or voter assistance</a> to individuals registered to vote outside the state. According to the federal <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2022.08.15-Complaint-for-Declaratory-and-Injunctive-Relief-as-filed.pdf">complaint</a> filed last week in Phoenix, <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2R/laws/0270.pdf">Senate Bill 1260</a> is a vague law that affords officials subjective measures to target volunteers and voting groups who provide mistaken voters a “mechanism for voting.” “The term ‘mechanism for voting’ is not defined, but the statute expressly emphasizes that it is broad enough to include the mere act of ‘forwarding an early ballot’ addressed to the voter,” the 30-page lawsuit states. Plaintiffs Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans, Voto Latino and Priorities USA all provide voting outreach to the public. They claim their volunteers or even a voter’s family member could face Class 5 felony charges for the voting support mishaps. “Consider an Arizona parent who receives an early ballot in the mail for their child who just finished college out of state but is eligible to vote in Arizona,” the groups say in their complaint. “That parent could face felony charges if they forward the student’s early ballot to them if the student at some point registered to vote in their out-of-state college town — even if the student has no intention to, and never actually does, vote in two places.”</p>
<p>A new law that would require county recorders to<a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1804177/lawsuit-challenges-new-law-cancels-voter-registration-suspected-non-citizens"> cancel the voter registration</a> of anyone they have a reason to believe is not a U.S. citizen will be challenged in court.  Attorneys for Arizona Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander for Equity Coalition say the provision will result in arbitrary investigations of citizens using databases that are not designed to determine voting eligibility.  Under the new law, anyone who does not provide evidence of citizenship within 35 days is referred to the county attorney and attorney general for investigation. A lawyer representing the group says the 35-day window was chosen for political reasons to take effect before the November election. Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed a similar bill earlier this year that would have allowed 90 days for people to respond, saying it was too vague.</p>

Brooks of the U.S. District Court in Fayetteville ruled that Arkansas violated the Voting Rights Act with its six-voter limit for those who<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/22/us/politics/arkansas-voting-lawsuit.html"> help people cast ballots in person</a>, which critics had argued disenfranchised immigrants and people with disabilities. In a 39-page ruling Brooks wrote that Congress had explicitly given voters the choice of whom they wanted to assist them at the polls, as long as it was not their employer or union representative. Arkansas United, a nonprofit group that helps immigrants, including many Latinos who are not proficient in English,<a href="https://www.maldef.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Arkansas-Voter-Assistance-Complaint_FILED.pdf"> filed a lawsuit in 2020</a> after having to deploy additional employees and volunteers to provide translation services to voters at the polls in order to avoid violating the state law, the group said. It described its work as nonpartisan. State and county election officials have said the law was intended to prevent anyone from gaining undue influence. the secretary of state, the State Board of Election Commissioners and election officials in three counties (Washington, Benton and Sebastian) were named as defendants in the lawsuit challenging the voter-assistance restrictions. It was not immediately clear whether they planned to appeal the ruling.</p>

According to Cleaver, the board wasn’t authorized to make such a decision, and she said the payout came from the organization’s charitable funds, which, she claims, constituted a misappropriation. In Cleaver’s telling, the Board terminated her as CEO after she threatened to notify state and federal authorities about the severance agreement. Vote.org, however, has a different story; it categorically denies any wrongdoing and says the allegations in Cleaver’s lawsuit are “without merit,” according to a spokesperson for the group who declined to be named. “It’s disappointing that a former leader, who claims to support our work to ensure all eligible Americans can vote, is instead focusing on personal grievances,” the spokesperson tells TIME. The spokesperson claimed that Cleaver was fired not because of her threat to report the severance package, which Vote.org maintains was legal and justified, but because of her erratic and abrasive personal behavior. They added that Cleaver was removed as head of the organization by a unanimous vote of the group’s board “for conduct that was witnessed by multiple individuals and documented.”</p>
<p>Conservative groups that successfully challenged San Francisco’s law allowing<a href="https://edsource.org/updates/conservative-groups-sue-oakland-to-block-ballot-measure-allowing-non-citizens-to-vote-in-school-elections"> noncitizen parents to vote</a> in local school board elections have sued Oakland to remove a similar proposal from the city’s November ballot. The Oakland City Council voted 6-0 on June 21 to place a measure on the ballot that would enable the city to authorize about 13,000 noncitizen parents or guardians of school-age children to vote in elections for the city’s seven school board members. The Oakland ballot measure said noncitizens, including legal residents and undocumented immigrants, make up 14% of Oakland’s population and now lack “representation in key decisions that impact their education and their lives.” The new lawsuit filed in Alameda County Superior Court, said such a law would violate a provision of the California Constitution that declares,  “A United States citizen 18 years of age and resident in this State may vote.” The suit was filed in state Superior Court by James V. Lacy and two organizations he leads, the United States Justice Foundation and the California Public Policy Foundation, with an Oakland resident as an additional plaintiff, the newspaper reported. Lacey won a victory with a similar suit in San Francisco earlier this month that overturned a voter-approved measure to let non-citizens vote in school board races there.</p>

One lawsuit was filed in El Paso County District Court by two El Paso voters against the El Paso Board of Commissioners and El Paso County Clerk Chuck Broerman. Another lawsuit was filed in Mesa County District Court by two Mesa voters against the Mesa County Board of Commissioners and the county’s designated election official, Brandi Bantz. The lawsuits, both filed Friday, are nearly identical. They say the Dominion election system used in the counties “is illegal because it systematically deletes records in the normal course of its operation” and “periodic updates of the system delete all records located on the system at the time of the update.” Dominion Voting Systems machines are used in 62 of Colorado’s 64 counties. The plaintiffs’ attorney in both cases is Greenwood Village-based John Case. When asked if similar lawsuits might appear in other Colorado counties, he said, “It’s certainly possible.” But he did not himself have plans to file such additional lawsuits.</p>

Brown blames city election officials who lost track of several ballots. He held a narrow lead, but then lost the race after what he calls a “chaotic” and “unreliable” recount. Hearst Connecticut Media reported that the re-canvas was halted Tuesday when election officials realized they were short at least 9 absentee ballots. This resulted in an hour-long search for the missing votes, which were never found. Candidates may challenge election results in state Superior Court if they believe a mistake was made during the counting process. State law allows judges the power to order new elections if they find the error could have changed the outcome of the race.</p>

Last week, the department filed a petition stating Florida Republicans intentionally targeted Black voters when Gov. Ron. DeSantis signed the bill into law in 2021.

In the filing it states, &#8220;Florida asserted interests in preventing voter fraud and restoring voter confidence.&#8221; The DOJ along with the NAACP and League of Women Voters claim Florida Republicans intentionally targeted black voters when they came up with this law.

The board contends that they alone have the responsibility to select an elections supervisor candidate who must be approved by the mayor and commission to be hired. The mayor’s committee would have excluded the politically independent, at-large chair Kaplan and two other members of the board of elections, according to the court filing. “Defendants’ proposed selection committee not only violates the separation of powers enshrined in… the charter, it also threatens to undermine the public’s trust in anybody who is appointed as elections supervisor, as that person would be the product of an inherently partisan and unlawful process,” stated the complaint. “By appointing two Democrats and two Republicans to the selection committee, Mayor Miller, a Republican, has essentially made himself the tie-breaker and ensured that nobody will be recommended for the elections supervisor role who he and his political faction do not approve of,” the complaint further states. The election board is asking a judge to compel the mayor and commission to abide by the charter, deem the mayor’s selection committee as illegal and declare that county elected officials may only approve an elections supervisor who was selected by them. They also are asking the court to dismantle Miller’s committee, which has never met, and pay their attorney fees.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee has<a href="https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/08/19/judge-declines-block-ban-on-giving-food-water-voters"> declined to block a section of a Georgia election law</a> that bans handing out food and water to voters waiting in line. The provision is part of a sweeping elections overhaul passed by Georgia lawmakers last year. Voting rights groups, who have filed a lawsuit challenging multiple parts of the law, argued that the provision infringes their free speech rights and should be immediately blocked while the case is pending. The 74-page order means that the provision will remain in effect for the closely watched November general election.  The state had argued that the provision was necessary to protect against conditions at polling places that could raise worries over potential illegal campaigning or vote buying. State lawyers also argued it was too close to the upcoming election to make changes. Boulee said the voting rights groups may ultimately prevail on part of their challenge, but he agreed with the state that it&#8217;s too close to the election to block any part of the provision. He noted that requiring different rules for the general election than those in place for the primaries earlier this year could cause confusion for election workers. Boulee said that voting rights groups had failed to show that prohibiting the distribution of food and drinks within 150 feet (45 meters) of a polling place violates their constitutional rights. But he said that another part of the provision that bars people from offering food and drink within 25 feet (7.6 meters) of any person in line is probably unconstitutional because that zone is tied to the location of voters and could stretch thousands of feet from the polling place.</p>

Mark Gietzen, who along with election denier Melissa Leavitt raised enough money to force a recount in nine counties has sued Secretary of State Scott Schwalb<a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article264806864.html"> demanding a hand recount of every race in the Aug. 2 primary election</a>, including a second recount of Sedgwick County’s abortion rights vote and a “revote” in counties that use electronic voting machines to mark ballots. In the lawsuit, Gietzen, who is representing himself, uses a programming error in a small race in Cherokee County and a missed deadline in Sedgwick County to push unproven theories about hackers using malicious computer viruses to flip votes in the Aug. 2 election. Ballots were already recounted by hand in four of the state’s most densely populated counties — Johnson, Sedgwick, Shawnee and Douglas, which all rejected the ballot by a wide margin — and four smaller counties where the amendment failed. Those counties were Crawford, Harvey, Jefferson and Lyon. Fewer than 70 votes changed — a minuscule fraction of the total vote count — and no evidence of fraud or large scale error was uncovered. Schwab said the recount “proves once and for all that there is no systemic election fraud in our state’s election process.”</p>

The provision places a<a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2022/08/24/felony-conviction-voting-ban-mississippi/"> lifetime ban on voting</a> in most instances on people convicted of certain felonies — crimes that the framers of the 1890 state Constitution said Black Mississippians were more prone to commit. The framers did not disenfranchise people convicted of murder or rape, for instance, but did strip voting rights of people convicted of several “lesser crimes,” which the writers of the Constitution falsely believed would be committed by Black Americans. The “per curiam” or unsigned opinion of the 5th Circuit said because of actions taken by the Legislature in the 1950s and 1960s allowing voters a chance to amend the constitutional provision, among other things adding murder and rape as disenfranchising crimes, the provision no longer has a racist taint. “Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that Section 241 as it currently stands was motivated by discriminatory intent or that any other approach to demonstrating the provision’s unconstitutionality is viable,” the majority said. The majority opinion also cited the Legislature taking up the issue in the 1980s and opting not to change it. The provision was defended on behalf of the state by the office of Attorney General Lynn Fitch.</p>

People without a government-issued photo ID can cast provisional ballots that will be counted if they return later that day with a photo ID or if election officials verify their signatures.  A lesser known provision in the measure bans payment for anyone who works to help register voters and requires those volunteers to be registered Missouri voters themselves. Anyone who helps register more than 10 voters would need to sign up with the Secretary of State’s Office. The plaintiffs alleged that the law limits free speech by restricting voter engagement. “Missouri’s new law would make it more difficult for civil rights groups to register voters, criminalize some efforts to encourage lawfully registered voters to cast ballots, and needlessly prevent some registered voters from voting,” Missouri NAACAP general counsel Janette McCarthy Wallace said in a statement. “Put simply, the law would suppress votes and disenfranchise voters.”</p>

However, the North Carolina Supreme Court stopped short of striking down the voter ID requirement and another constitutional amendment that limited income tax rates, ruling that a lower court must gather more evidence on the measures before tossing them out. Voter identification is not currently required in North Carolina, because it&#8217;s held up in separate litigation regarding state voter laws. Friday&#8217;s ruling doesn&#8217;t alter that situation.<a href="https://appellate.nccourts.org/opinions/?c=1&amp;pdf=41699"> The long-awaited ruling,</a> decided 4-3 by the court&#8217;s Democratic majority, is a victory for the state NAACP, which sued Republican legislative leaders. It undoes a state appeals court ruling that upheld the amendments, and it sends the case back to Wake County Superior Court Judge Bryan Collins, who previously struck down the amendments. Writing for the majority, Associate Justice Anita Earls noted that “what makes this case so unique is that the General Assembly, acting with the knowledge that 28 of its districts were unconstitutionally racially gerrymandered and that more than two-thirds of all legislative districts needed to be redrawn to achieve compliance with the Equal Protection Clause, chose to initiate the process of amending the state constitution.” However, the opinion said that before taking a step as serious as undoing constitutional amendments approved by voters, the trial court must gather more evidence on whether leaving the amendments in place would allow improperly elected legislators to escape accountability, further exclude voters from the democratic process or amount to continued discrimination. In a dissent, Associate Justice Phil Berger Jr. wrote that the ruling by the court’s Democratic majority “unilaterally reassigns constitutional duties and declares that the will of the judges is superior to the will of the people of North Carolina.”</p>

Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton <a href="https://texas.votebeat.org/2022/8/24/23320771/ken-paxton-ballots-public-records-election-security">released a legal opinion</a> stating that anyone may request access to cast ballots as soon as the day after an election. According to Votebeat, the opinion from Paxton doesn’t carry the force of law, but experts say it will almost certainly serve as the basis for a lawsuit by activists. The opinion has already impacted election administrators across the state, who told Votebeat that they’ve seen an onslaught of requests since Paxton released it. Paxton’s office sought input from the secretary of state’s office prior to issuing the decision, which was requested by legislators. The secretary of state’s office recommended keeping the current waiting period.  “The voted ballots are the core of the election process and the prohibition on disturbing the ballots (except in limited circumstances as permitted by the Election Code) preserves the integrity of the election itself,” wrote Adam Bitter, general counsel for the office,<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22187389-sos-brief-in-response-to-rq-0424-kp"> in a letter obtained by Votebeat</a> through a public records request. “Handling of the voted ballots themselves opens up the possibility of accidental or intentional damage or misplacement that could call into question the election after the fact.”  Paxton’s office did not respond to specific questions about why he disagreed with Bitter’s conclusion, nor did he respond to requests for comment.</p>

Four days later the county commission approved an amended ordinance that gives the tribe a chance to elect two of its preferred candidates to the county commission, but not until 2024. Three of the five county commissioners voting on that plan are up for reelection this year. Lyman County filed notice of its intent to appeal the judge’s order to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and asked the federal judge for an emergency stay of the Aug. 11 order pending appeal. The judge said no. The county has said in briefs and in testimony that it does not have time to make changes before November. In its Aug. 18 response to the judge’s order, the county noted it sent ballots to the printer the day before, the same day the county notified the court that it intends to appeal. Lange replied that there isn’t anything to appeal at this point, because the court has not yet taken the issue out of the county’s hands and fashioned its own remedy. Judge Lange set a hearing on the matter for Aug. 23.</p>

In a<a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/show_temp-11.pdf"> statement of interest</a> submitted to the federal court hearing the case, the DOJ said that no matter what state law says, voters with disabilities must be allowed to have assistance because of provisions in the Voting Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. “Voters with disabilities are entitled to an equal opportunity to participate in absentee voting programs and must be provided reasonable modifications when necessary to avoid discrimination,” DOJ stated. “The rights conferred by Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act and Title II of the ADA are rights squarely guaranteed, regardless of whether state laws or provisions otherwise limit such assistance.” In response to the federal lawsuit, the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is representing the WEC, said it agrees with the voters that federal law protects absentee ballot return assistance and therefore there isn’t a controversy so the case should be dismissed. In the filing, the DOJ stated that Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protect the right to get assistance whether for in-person or absentee voting. “Accordingly, all voters — whether they choose to vote absentee or not — who require assistance due to disability are entitled to Section 208’s protection, and ‘a state cannot restrict this federally guaranteed right’ by ‘defining terms [such as ‘vote’] more restrictively than as federally defined,’” DOJ wrote. “Any distinction that state law may make between in-person voting and absentee voting … therefore is irrelevant to the conclusion that Section 208’s federally guaranteed right applies to absentee voters.” DOJ also wrote that a provision in state law which requires municipal clerks to “make reasonable efforts to comply with requests for voting accommodations made by individuals with disabilities whenever feasible,” isn’t enough. DOJ argues that this leaves voting access up to the subjective decisions of clerks over what counts as “reasonable” and “feasible” when the protections of the Voting Rights Act are much broader.</p>

							<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
														<p><a href="https://ucla.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_r-b2cA7VRQKMJy5s415GVg">Moore v. Harper, the Independent State Legislature Theory, and Potential Threats to American Democracy</a>: The Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA promotes research, collaboration, and advocacy under the leadership of UCLA Law Professor Richard L. Hasen; one of the nation&#8217;s leading election scholars. The Safeguarding Democracy Project is built upon the premise that tackling issues of the U.S. election integrity must be collaborative: across ideologies, across scholarly disciplines, and as a bridge between theory and practice. Moderated by Richard L. Hasen, featured speakers include: Vikram D. Amar, Derek T. Miller, Richard H. Pildes, Carolyn Shapiro and Franit Tolson. <strong>When:</strong> August 25, 3pm Pacific. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/events/engaging-students-informed-democracy-role-k-12-schools">Engaging Students for an Informed Democracy: The Role of K-12 Schools</a>: Young people want to learn about elections in school and, when they do, they’re more likely to vote, engage in their communities, and become engaged and informed members of our self-governing society. Despite the extraordinary efforts of many educators, civic education too often is insufficient and inequitable. We can change that. Join us for a research presentation and panel, co-hosted by CIRCLE and iCivics, on how K-12 schools can play a role in preparing young people for participation in our nation&#8217;s constitutional democracy. The civic education experts at CIRCLE will share major findings and recommendations from the CIRCLE Growing Voters report about teens’ civic learning experiences — or lack thereof — and the role of schools in a paradigm-shifting framework for supporting young people’s civic development. In conversation with educators, students, teacher trainers, and other education leaders, we’ll discuss what these findings mean for multiple stakeholders in the K-12 schools ecosystem and the practical steps they can take to ensure each and every student, especially those from disadvantaged or marginalized communities, receives a high-quality civic education during this school year and into the future. <strong>When:</strong> August 31, 3pm Eastern. <strong>Where:</strong> Online.</p>

<p><a href="https://airtable.com/shrcT6yJq4GToe5qp">Michigan Deputy Coordinator</a>, U.S. Elections, The Carter Center— The Democracy Program at The Carter Center works globally to support and strengthen participatory democracy, consistent with human rights. Beginning in 2020, The Carter Center began efforts to support elections in the United States. There are multiple key aspects to this project: establishing nonpartisan observation efforts, tracking disinformation and dangerous speech, contributing to electoral reform, and promoting candidate codes of conduct. The Carter Center is advancing nonpartisan observation efforts in two key states: Arizona and Michigan. These states were selected following assessments completed on multiple states. Nonpartisan observation efforts implemented and/or supported by The Carter Center will differ from existing partisan pollwatchers and election-protection groups. The goal of nonpartisan observation is to provide credible and transparent information on the conduct of elections in each state through public reports. The Deputy Coordinator will execute the citizen observation plan and develop partnerships with community-based organizations. They will report directly to the US Elections Coordinator in [Michigan/Arizona] and to the US Elections team in Atlanta. <strong>Application:</strong> For the complete job listing and to apply,<a href="https://airtable.com/shrcT6yJq4GToe5qp"> click here</a>.</p>
