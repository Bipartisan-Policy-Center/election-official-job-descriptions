														<p><strong>Information Gaps and Misinformation in the 2022 Elections</strong><br />
<em>A new report from Brennan Center for Justice and First Draft<br />
</em></p>
<p>By<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/about/staff/mekela-panditharatne"> Mekela Panditharatne</a>, counsel<br />

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8655" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lies-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lies-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lies-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lies.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Plunging trust in elections. Rising threats. A flood of exits. For the workers charged with administering our elections, the cascading dangers driven by misinformation about a rigged 2020 election are only intensifying ahead of November’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>Misinformation can result when the demand for information outpaces its supply. A<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/information-gaps-and-misinformation-2022-elections"> new report released this week by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law and First Draft</a> identifies major gaps in the public’s knowledge of elections that could lead to misinformation in the 2022 elections and explains how to mitigate the risk.</p>
<p>For new citizens and newly registered voters—the latter group of which Latino voters make up the largest share—the risk of absorbing misinformation is particularly severe since these voters can be unfamiliar with the voting process.</p>
<p>Two elections in the past year highlight the perils and opportunities for voters and election officials. In Texas, a sweeping new voting law cut back election officials’ ability to inform voters about changes to mail voting at a time when voter education was crucial to understanding the new rules. The restrictive law made it harder to vote by mail by adding complex new ID requirements. In the state’s March 2022 primary election, these new elements combined to cause devastating consequences: remarkable surges in mail ballot and mail ballot application rejection rates. Mail ballot rejection rates rose more than 1,100 percent from the 2020 general election—a stunning increase that meant that some eligible voters’ ballots weren’t counted in the election. Meanwhile, election officials struggled to curb confusion-induced misinformation in the face of new limits.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8681" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BrennanCenter.png" alt="" width="184" height="128" />In California, an unusual special election could have provided fresh fodder for misinformation to thrive in Los Angeles. But election officials worked proactively to educate voters and nip misinformation in the bud. The state’s 2021 recall election for governor was a recipe for confusion. The election took place outside an election year. Gubernatorial recall elections were virtually unprecedented—before 2021, only one had taken place in the state’s history. The recall ballot itself was atypical.</p>
<p>But in Los Angeles County, election officials ran a robust education campaign to help diminish these areas of confusion ahead of the election. The campaign included videos in multiple languages that ran on digital channels and broadcast media. Officials also connected with media outlets, set up an online tip line and telephone support, and monitored social media to detect misunderstandings. Officials said these actions helped them to quickly combat misinformation as it arose.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8682" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/First-Draft.png" alt="" width="244" height="132" />The threats to election officials, and our elections as a whole, are grave and mounting. But election workers can act now to boost voters’ confidence in elections and ensure access to the polls. To reduce misinformation, officials can develop timely education campaigns that cover confusing topics, use video tutorials and infographics to inform voters, set up Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) pages that answer doubts about election process and integrity, and publish rumor control pages. Before innocent Election Day glitches spur misinformation, election officials can set up extensive media contacts and communication channels with secretaries of state, candidates, and civic groups to respond swiftly to surprise incidents.</p>
<p>Our democracy depends on safe, fair, and accessible elections that have voters’ trust. Guarding against election misinformation is a vital step towards restoring and preserving confidence in the system.</p>

							<h2>Primary Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>Six more states hold primaries</strong><br />
<em>Despite the national spotlight, a pretty typical election day</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti</p>
<p>Six more states held primaries this week — Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Washington — and although there were some isolated problems, overall it was a relatively smooth election day.</p>
<p>Given the role some of Tuesday’s states played in the 2020 election, there were a lot of eyes on the process and what they saw, despite some of the rhetoric and headlines, was a fairly typical election day that happened to include some typical problems—ballot shortages, lines, gas leaks and reporting problems—and some atypical problems—a brawl, a voter threatening to shoot voting equipment and historically low turnout.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a closer look at some of what happened on Tuesday:</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5869" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AZ-Welcome-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AZ-Welcome-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AZ-Welcome-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AZ-Welcome.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona</strong>: All eyes were on Arizona on Tuesday and there was certainly some newsworthy issues in a handful of Arizona’s 15 counties, from a long-time observers opinion, it was a pretty typical election day.  The biggest issues of the day were in<a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/voter-confusion-continues-in-pinal-county-due-to-unprecedented-demand-for-in-person-ballots"> Pinal County</a> where numerous vote centers ran out of ballots due to unexpectedly high in-person turnout. The shortage of in-person ballots came on the heels of an issue with early voting ballots. &#8220;We&#8217;re all human. We&#8217;ve all screwed up. There&#8217;s nothing sinister. It wasn&#8217;t as if we said, ‘Hey, this is only going to impact a Republican, or this is only going to impact a Democrat.’ This was widespread, it was equal opportunity, it was just simply a mistake,&#8221; Pinal County Attorney Kent Volkmer said. Pinal County wasn’t alone in running out of ballots although they got most of the headlines for it. In<a href="https://www.kvoa.com/news/decision2022/pima-county-voting-centers-hit-some-snags-on-primary-election-day/article_3f93b4f0-12cc-11ed-ba6b-3f4c5d047d29.html"> Pima County</a>, which was rolling out e-poll books and vote centers for the first time, several sites ran out of ballots due to higher than expected in-person turnout. Pima County Administrator Jan Lesher told the Board of Supervisors during their meeting Tuesday that the<a href="https://www.gvnews.com/news/few-glitches-in-new-vote-process/article_b12e63f8-12c7-11ed-8f28-130e0c2ae22d.html"> e-poll book roll out</a> was going smoothly. “What I’m hearing this morning is that everything has been working efficiently, and people were able to check-in,” Lesher said. Lesher noted that there were some small hiccups early on with some delays in setting up, and that two ballot-on-demand printers were not working properly, but said they were quickly replaced. In<a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2022/08/02/maricopa-county-attorney-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-gop-candidate-over-pen-thefts/"> Maricopa County</a>, county attorney Rachel Mitchell was forced to send a cease-and-desist letter to a GOP candidate who was encouraging voters to steal the pens from polling places because she claimed the pens could lead to “ghost votes” by bleeding through the paper. In<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/08/02/arizona-polls-open-august-2022-primary-election/10166077002/"> other pen-related</a> news Maricopa officials were forced to tamp down conspiracy theories about smudged ink. County Recorder Stephen Richer said he was aware of ink smearing on some ballots in one location. But no ballots were rejected or spoiled, he said.  &#8220;I am not aware of anyone who has been turned down,&#8221; he told The Arizona Republic  Tuesday. &#8220;I am not aware of anyone who has not been able to vote.&#8221;<a href="https://kdminer.com/news/2022/aug/03/mohave-county-still-awaits-official-election-resul/"> Mohave County</a>’s new results reporting process slowed things down a bit this year which got some members of the media antsy. “No election is 100% perfect. Our staff and volunteers can be proud of their accomplishment. We’re going to be busy properly documenting everything over the next few days and then, we’ll concentrate on the upcoming general election in November,” County Elections Director Allen Tempert  said in the news release. “I’m confident that we’ll have a fair and well-run fall election in Mohave County.” And in the<a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2022/08/04/fontes-finchem-matchup-appears-likely-race-secretary-state/"> race for secretary of state</a>, while ballots are still being tallied it appears that Democrat Adrian Fontes will face Republican Mark Finchman.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5466" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/KSWelcome-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/KSWelcome-300x199.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/KSWelcome.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Kansas</strong>: Spurred on by the first<a href="https://fox4kc.com/news/value-them-both-amendment-creates-unique-challenges-for-kansas-election-officials/"> post-Roe vote</a> on abortion, turnout in Kansas’ primary  was “crazy high” on Tuesday.  In<a href="https://www.kwch.com/2022/08/03/polls-closed-kansas-delays-expected-with-voters-still-line/"> Sedgwick County</a>, voters stood in long, hot lines to cast their ballots. “We did know this was going to be a heavy, well-attended election. We did expect those lines and we did see some lines today. But we are very excited that a lot of people came out to have their voice heard and get their vote cast,” Sedgwick County Election Commissioner Angela Caudillo said. Several voters experienced medical emergencies while waiting in line and firefighters passed out water to voters at at least one polling place. Also in Sedgwick County, officials said election workers made the wrong decision in telling voters at a polling location in Maize that they&#8217;d have to<a href="https://www.kake.com/story/47014778/this-decision-was-wrong-voters-turned-away-from-maize-polling-location"> vote somewhere else</a>. In<a href="http://www.abilene-rc.com/news/county-postpones-primary-election-unofficial-results-until-today-after-crazy-high-turnout/article_1f9e0234-136e-11ed-895f-efacb3bd1e42.html"> Dickinson County</a>, almost all precincts ran out of paper ballots that could be read by a vote machine. The precincts had to request more paper ballots, and the ones they received cannot be read by the vote tally machines meaning several hundred ballots needed to be counted by hand. “It’s too bad we don’t have a turn out like this for every election…” County Clerk Jeanne Livingston said. In-person voting on primary day and early mail voting were both high in<a href="https://www.wibw.com/2022/08/03/after-record-primary-numbers-shawnee-county-another-big-turnout-expected-novembers-general-election/"> Shawnee County</a>. “I think it’s going to end up being numbers right on the button of about 55 percent voter turnout,” Shawnee County Election Commissioner Andrew Howell said, “…which is just huge for a primary. We’ve never seen anything like it for a primary that I’m aware of.” Election night was a bit different in<a href="https://www.thekansan.com/2022/08/03/election-night-takes-on-a-new-look/"> Harvey County</a> this year after County Clerk Rick Piepho switched things up a bit and moved ballot counting to the community room of the courthouse which provided more room for new equipment and election observers. And in the race for<a href="https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/08/03/amid-kansas-election-misinformation-scott-schwab-wins-re-nomination/10206964002/"> secretary of state</a>, incumbent Secretary of State Scott Schwab (R) will face Democrat Jeanna Repass who ran unopposed.</p>

Probably the biggest issue on Tuesday was<a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/democracy-2022/election-results-delayed-65-michigan-counties-reporting-modem-issues"> delayed results reporting</a> in 65 of the states 83 counties due to modem issues. Officials in Wayne County said AT&amp;T’s<a href="https://gcn.com/cloud-infrastructure/2022/08/3g-retirement-blamed-some-delayed-michigan-election-results/375327/"> decision to retire its 3G services</a> was partially responsible for the delay. A gas leak at a polling place in<a href="https://www.thedailyreporter.com/story/news/2022/08/02/gas-leak-closes-coldwater-polls-tuesday-morning/10212173002/"> Coldwater Township</a> forced the evacuation of a polling place for about 20 minutes. A timing mark printed on the back of some ballots in<a href="https://thecountypress.mihomepaper.com/articles/eighteen-lapeer-county-precincts-reported-vote-counting-machine-disruption/"> Lapeer County</a> was defective and caused them to be rejected by the ballot machine. New ballots were printed and delivered to voting precincts that had issues with their counting machines. An unattended backpack at a polling place in<a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/08/low-voter-turnout-a-suspicious-backpack-michigans-primary-election-so-far.html"> Linden</a> forced a polling place to relocate while police investigated. In Detroit,<a href="https://michigan.votebeat.org/2022/8/3/23291342/michigan-primary-detroit-absentee-ballots-huntington-place-poll-challenger-ejected"> one GOP poll challenger</a> had to be removed from a ballot processing site because he was harassing and agitating election workers. Dan Baxter, chief operating officer for the Detroit Election Department’s absentee ballots and special projects division, said the incident didn’t disrupt counting. It was the only such confrontation inside the center. Tuesday’s primary was also the first time<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/8/3/better-for-democracy-two-michigan-cities-offer-arabic-ballots"> Arabic speaking voters</a> in Dearborn and Hamtramck were able to cast their ballots in their native language.<a href="https://www.threeriversnews.com/local-news/burr-oak-twp-clerk-barred-administering-elections-until-further-notice"> Burr Oak Township</a> Clerk Jackie Wells was barred from administering the election by the state after it was reported that she issued absentee ballots instead of absentee ballot applications.</p>

Turnout was lower than expected in<a href="https://www.ky3.com/2022/08/02/election-day-greene-county-poll-workers-say-turnout-slower-than-expected/"> Greene County</a> where Clerk Shane Schoeller suspected Tuesday’s high temperatures may have kept people home. And perhaps it was the heat that sent things off the rails a bit in<a href="https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/local/brawls-death-threat-candidates-trying-to-run-over-each-other-st-louis-county-primary-election/63-feb7e53d-4f87-4894-8854-d6b80cf69c15"> St. Louis County</a>. There was a real donnybrook at one polling place in St. Louis County that had police breaking up a brawl that included around 40 people. In addition to the brawl poll workers at another polling place reported two candidates tried to run each other over in the parking lot, at another polling place a voter threatened to kill a candidate and at still another site, poll workers reported a campaign worker refusing to let voters into a polling place.  “This is unusual,” said Rick Stream, the Republican St. Louis County Board of Elections Director. “We don’t normally have stuff like this.” Stream said all of the incidents took place outside of polling places and did not interfere with voting.

County Clerk Melinda Patton told The Forum on Tuesday that initials marked by election judges on some ballots cast at the First Christian Church in Maryville inadvertently made the ballots unreadable by the tabulation machine.</p>

In the weeks and days leading up to the primary, elections officials had worried about getting enough poll workers and what overall turnout would be. While most counties reported getting the number of poll workers they needed, their concerns about turnout weren’t unfounded. According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Tuesday’s election saw the<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/news/2022/08/ohios-august-primary-breaks-modern-record-for-low-voter-participation.html"> lowest voter participation in a statewide primary</a> dating back to at least the 1960s. For Tuesday’s election, just 631,000 people cast ballots to pick Republican and Democratic state legislative candidates and state party central committee members. Most counties had turnout percentages in the single digits, although some, like<a href="https://www.salemnews.net/news/local-news/2022/08/2nd-primary-smooth-but-sparse-with-turnout-at-only-10-3/"> Columbiana County</a> and<a href="https://www.ashlandsource.com/news/elections/turnout-for-aug-2-election-in-ashland-county-highest-among-neighbors-shatters-expectations/article_f7b8badc-134c-11ed-be4e-a720663ecd97.html"> Ashland County</a>, did reach double digits.  Having two separate primaries probably didn’t help turnouts in other counties that didn’t have contested races, said Shannon Johnson, director of Ashland’s board of elections. “And tax money could have been used in a better way. If they had approved district maps in May, we wouldn’t have had to spend this money with just a single primary,” she said. Secretary of State Frank LaRose said he hopes<a href="https://wtov9.com/news/local/ohio-officials-hope-something-can-be-learned-from-this-years-election-chaos"> lessons can be learned</a> from this year for future elections. “It&#8217;s unfortunate that this has had to happen,” LaRose said. “The biggest thing is folks need to listen to our elections officials. Myself and our county boards of elections have been saying for months that we needed to get this finalized so we can do what we do best and that is to run elections.&#8221; In<a href="https://www.13abc.com/2022/08/03/man-charged-after-allegedly-threatening-shoot-voting-machines-elementary-school/"> Lucas County</a> resident Robert B.

There were no reported issues with that on primary day and is typical of this long-time vote-by-mail state, there really weren’t any reported issues at all on Tuesday. The biggest news of the day, from our perspective, is the results of the jungle primary for<a href="https://www.chronline.com/stories/washington-secretary-of-state-primary-results-democratic-incumbent-hobbs-trounces-field,297827"> secretary of state</a>. Incumbent Secretary of State Steve Hobbs (D) won handedly with 41% over a field of seven challengers.

Polite and a bipartisan group of about 750 election officials and workers from across the country as they prepare for the midterm elections. The Election Threats Task Force, which was created last year to address an increasing number of election workers&#8217; concerns over ongoing threats against them, also found that in instances where a source of reported contact was identified, &#8220;in 50% of the matters, the source contacted the victim on multiple occasions.&#8221; Aside from the 11% of the contacts that merited a federal investigation, &#8220;the remaining reported contacts did not provide a predication for a federal criminal investigation,&#8221; the Justice Department said in a news release announcing the findings on Monday. &#8220;While many of the contacts were often hostile, harassing, and abusive towards election officials, they did not include a threat of unlawful violence.&#8221; The task force has brought four federal criminal cases so far, the Justice Department said, and plans to bring more cases in the near future. Elections officials also<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/02/politics/election-threats-workers/index.html"> testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee</a> this week that the FBI’s process for receiving reports of violent threats or harassment against election officials s not built to handle the volume of reports, leaving the Justice Department with an incomplete picture of the problem&#8217;s scope as the midterms. &#8220;A common refrain I hear from my members is that nobody is going to take this seriously until something bad happens, and we are all braced for the worst,&#8221; Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED), testified. In addition to this week’s DOJ briefing, there were stories from several states about the impacts ongoing threats are having on elections workers. In<a href="https://www.wral.com/threats-intimidation-and-legal-action-skeptics-strain-nc-election-workers/20395642/"> North Carolina</a>, threats, intimidation and legal action from election skeptics are putting a strain on election workers.

The idea behind the creation of the Election and Government Mail Services is to have a permanent division dedicated to dealing with election matters, instead of handling issues one at a time as in the past. Adrienne Marshall, executive director of the division, said that the services will oversee “election mail strike teams” in every local and district community to address any problems that might arise. “We are fully committed to the secure and timely delivery of the nation’s election mail,” she said. Despite the pandemic, the Postal Service said it delivered 97.9% of ballots from voters to election officials within three days, and 99.89% of ballots were delivered within seven days, in the 2020 election. The Postal Service is sending guidance letters to election officials in each state and territory.</p>

Instead of using traditional patriotic motifs, Rowan submitted a drawing of a wild-eyed, widely smiling human head on insect legs rendered in bold psychedelic colors. The contest quickly went viral on social media, leading to coverage by the New York Times, NPR, CBS News and other media outlets around the globe. “It’s been so nice to get so much positive support from people,” said Hudson in mid-July. (I was) very surprised.”  The other five finalists in the county’s contest also received impressive vote tallies. The viral popularity of Rowan’s design and the “I Voted” sticker contest is a good thing, said Ashley Dittus (D), who alongside John Quigley (R) is an election commissioner on the Ulster County Board of Elections.  “We have been overwhelmed and pleasantly surprised by how far reaching our ‘I Voted’ sticker contest has gone this year,” said Dittus. “The contest was launched two years ago as a part of our youth voter engagement program, and I think that because this is a contest for and by youth that it has resonated with younger people in a way that I have never seen before.” Dittus said she hopes the buzz in July will bring people out to the polls in November.  Hudson said he was pleased his design was bringing attention to the election process. “I would be very happy if I influenced people to go out and vote,” he said.</p>

The bills — which do everything from allowing minors to serve as poll workers to permitting the counting of mail-in ballots prior to Election Day — passed the Legislature in June before lawmakers went on their customary summer recess. “With this bill package, New Jersey continues to expand access to the ballot box and provide additional resources to our election officials, while strengthening the security of our elections,” Secretary of State Tahesha Way said in a statement. “The right to vote is the very foundation of our democracy and we are committed to making voting as safe, simple, and transparent as possible.” The bills signed into law would also: Make changes to voting procedures, like requiring ballot privacy sleeves at polling places and allowing election officials to begin counting mail-in ballots three days before Election Day. Require local health officers to send the names of every adult who dies in their town to their county voter registration office during the two months preceding a primary or general election, in a bid to remove dead voters from the voter rolls. Stop automatically sending mail-in ballots to voters if they don’t vote by mail for four consecutive election cycles starting in 2020.</p>

(These) election officials played a critical role in making the 2020 election safe, secure, and accessible during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The resolution also states that since the 2020 general election “some in our society have attempted to bully, threaten, and undermine nonpartisan election administrators, making it harder for election officials to do their jobs, and reducing faith in the electoral process in a manner that hurts the health of our democracy.” Looking forward to the 2022 general election and beyond, the City Council reaffirmed “our conviction that non-partisan election officials like our city clerk/treasurer, City of Kenosha election inspectors, and the Wisconsin Election Commission are best equipped to preside over free and fair elections, and should do so without the fear of threats and intimidation.” With the resolution’s passage, the City Council expressed “full confidence” in the non-partisan elected officials and called on state lawmakers to “cease all attempts to undermine, disrupt, or revoke Wisconsin Election Commission’s authority over Wisconsin elections, as well as the authority of municipal clerks.”</p>

Griffin had set the hearing for August 11, but lawyers for both sides asked for the later date. Griffin ordered both sides to file all briefs and written material by August 25. The lawsuit claims that the electronic ballot scanners that count votes in Alabama elections are unreliable because they can be connected to the Internet and tampered with. They also claim that the Electronic Voting Committee has failed to publicly inspect the machines. The lawsuit asks the judge to declare the use of the machines unconstitutional and to order the state to conduct the general election in November with a hand-count of paper ballots that is witnessed and live-streamed and recorded by video cameras.</p>

Lawyers for the organization are asking Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Joseph Mikitish to block it from appearing on the November ballot. But attorney Jim Barton who represents the initiative backers, said he is convinced that there is no merit to the complaint. The measure being challenged contains a laundry list of changes to state election laws. For example, it would allow people to register and vote at the same time, including on Election Day. And people would be registered to vote automatically when they get an Arizona driver&#8217;s license unless they opt out. It also would reinstate the state&#8217;s permanent early voting list which automatically provides ballots by mail for anyone who requests it, overturning a decision last year by the Republican-controlled legislature. In seeking to disqualify the measure, challengers alleged a series of violations of laws that affect the signature-gathering process for initiatives.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-5220" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Colorado-Flag-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="174" height="118" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Colorado-Flag-300x203.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Colorado-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 174px) 100vw, 174px" />Colorado:</strong> A group of Republican candidates for state and local offices, including Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who lost their primary elections in June are asking a court to<a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/republican-recount-candidates-in-second-lawsuit-want-denver-judge-to-halt-process/"> halt a ballot recount process</a> that they paid to initiate. The group, members of the Colorado Recount Coalition, filed a lawsuit Monday in Denver District Court that seeks to stop the recount in El Paso County and order that county’s clerk, Chuck Broerman, a Republican, to hand over records to the secretary of state, Jena Griswold, a Democrat, so that she may conduct the recount. Every candidate in the group besides Peters is running for a local or state office in El Paso. The same group of candidates except for Peters<a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/08/01/el-paso-clerk-cites-blatantly-false-claims-as-recount-group-turns-to-lawsuits/"> filed another lawsuit</a> late last week in El Paso District Court against Broerman and Griswold claiming that for each of the candidates about half the fee they were required to pay for the recount was for a purpose that was “unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious.”</p>

Clark was arrested Friday on one count each of making a bomb threat, perpetrating a bomb hoax and communicating an interstate threat, the Justice Department said in a press release. The federal indictment states that on Feb. 14, 2021, Clark posted a message through a contact form on the Arizona secretary of state&#8217;s office elections division website in which he wrote, &#8220;Your attorney general needs to resign by Tuesday February 16th by 9 am or the explosive device impacted in her personal space will be detonated.&#8221; Clark also searched online for the address of the election official, as well as the words, &#8220;how to kill,&#8221; the Justice Department said. Four days after sending the bomb threat, Clark did another online search for the words &#8220;fema boston marathon bombing&#8221; and &#8220;fema boston marathon bombing plan digital army,&#8221; according to the Justice Department. Clark appeared before a judge Friday in Boston federal court. If convicted as charged, he faces a maximum of up to 10 years in federal prison for the bomb threat, and five years in prison each for the other two counts.</p>

In a lawsuit filed last week, Republicans claimed that the Mercer election board violated New Jersey’s Ballot Cure Act – a law that allows voters whose vote-by-mail ballots were rejected for technical deficiencies, including unmatched signatures, to remedy their ballots – and the state’s Open Public Records Act. The RNC began seeking ballot cure letters on October 19, 2021.  Mercer appears to have punted and sought extensions, at one point saying the documents would be released after the certification date but did not respond until 91 days later, on January 18, 2022, and still did not give the records they asked for.</p>

The complaint seeks to strike down a state mandate that limits board membership to registered Democrats and Republicans. Common Cause North Carolina is bringing forward the federal lawsuit on behalf of four registered unaffiliated voters. They allege that the existing law is unconstitutional because it excludes the largest voting bloc from the five-member board that is tasked with administering elections in the state. “North Carolinians shouldn’t be forced to join a political party in order to serve the public,” Bob Phillips, the group’s executive director said in a statement. “Barring unaffiliated voters—who are North Carolina’s biggest group of voters—from being members of the State Board of Elections is profoundly unfair and clearly discriminatory.”</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5429" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag-300x169.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PA-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Pennsylvania</strong>: The state Supreme Court ruled this week that Pennsylvania’s 2019 law allowing<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-mail-voting-law-act-77-mclinko-20220802.html"> mail-in voting is constitutional</a>.  The law dramatically expanded mail voting from a method that had been allowed only in a very small number of cases — about 5% of votes in any given election — to one used by millions over the last two years. It was the product of bipartisan negotiations between Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and Republicans who control the state legislature, the biggest change to Pennsylvania election law in generations. But its implementation in 2020 came during both the first year of the pandemic and a heated presidential election. As massive numbers of voters cast ballots by mail, state and county elections officials tried to build out the system — in some cases triggering Republican outrage and lawsuits over their decisions. The 5-2 ruling, with the two Republican justices both voting no, means expanded vote-by-mail will almost certainly be in place for marquee races in November for governor and U.S. Senate. “We find no restriction in our Constitution on the General Assembly’s ability to create universal mail-in voting,” wrote Justice Christine Donohue in the <a href="https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-18A-E-2022mo.pdf?cb=1">majority opinion</a>. In a <a href="https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-18A-E-2022do1.pdf?cb=1">dissent</a>, Justice Kevin Brobson said the majority overruled 160 years of court precedent. “Today, this court upends the tradition and historic preference in this commonwealth for in-person voting without the requisite ‘special justification’ and important reasons necessary to set aside long-standing precedent,” Brobson wrote. “Mere disagreement with that precedent is not enough.”</p>
<p>Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is suing the Republican-controlled legislature in the state’s highest court over its<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/07/pa-abortion-constitutional-amendment-voter-id-lawsuit/"> efforts to change the Pennsylvania Constitution</a> to restrict — and potentially ban — access to abortion, add new requirements for voters at the polls, and scale back executive powers. Wolf is appealing to the state Supreme Court on an emergency basis, asking its seven justices to block the legislature from advancing a controversial, eleventh-hour measure that would ask voters to weigh in on five proposed amendments to the state’s constitution. Republicans who control both the state House and Senate also want voters to decide whether to require government-issued identification to vote in all instances and to give the legislature more say over rejecting regulations authored by a governor’s administration. They also want to require new election audits in addition to the ones already in place. Wolf, in his lawsuit, said legislative Republicans rammed through the proposed amendments with little debate as they were wrapping up work on the overdue state budget in early July. In doing so, he contends, GOP lawmakers unconstitutionally lumped together disparate pieces of their “failed” agenda.</p>

Senate Bill 1111 was passed during the 2021 Texas Legislative session. The bill, which passed the House and Senate on party-line votes, required people who register to vote using a P.O. box to provide proof of a home address to ensure that they vote only in eligible elections. The bill was signed into law on June 16, 2021. Less than a week later, two Latino groups and a voter rights group sued a group of county election administrators, saying the new law imposes &#8220;vague, onerous restrictions on the voter registration process, chilling political participation and further burdening the abilities of lawful voters to cast their ballots to make their voices heard.” Part of the lawsuit challenged a section of the law that prohibited people from establishing residence “for the purpose of influencing the outcome of a certain election.&#8221; That language could lead to unintended consequences, the groups argued. In a summary judgement, Yeakel found that the groups had suffered &#8220;direct harms&#8221; to their finances and to their First Amendment rights under the law, and that the state used vague language in the law and that parts of the fail &#8220;any degree of constitutional scrutiny.&#8221; The judge ruled that the law particularly burdened part-time and off-campus college students, who would be left unable to register both where they have moved and where they have moved from. &#8220;The burden imposed is &#8216;severe,&#8217; if not insurmountable,&#8221; Yeakel wrote. &#8220;Such an insurmountable burden is not easily overcome.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5228" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virginia-Flag-300x229.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="229" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virginia-Flag-300x229.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Virginia-Flag.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Virginia:</strong> U.S. District Judge David. J. Novak dismissed<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/01/federal-judge-throws-out-second-redistricting-suit-seeking-new-va-house-elections/"> a last-ditch effort to force new Virginia House of Delegates elections</a> in November, concluding the pandemic-related delay in the state’s redistricting process can’t justify the “extreme” step of ordering an election do-over. In a<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Thomas_Ruling.pdf"> 49-page opinion</a>, Novak ruled the plaintiffs in the case don’t have standing to sue the state and the federal courts lack the authority to order a new election. With early voting for the 2022 elections set to begin next month, Monday’s ruling appears to be the end of the line for efforts to hold new House elections this year. Novak, the same judge who dismissed a similar suit this year brought by Democratic attorney Paul Goldman, wrote that “the global pandemic delayed the reapportionment process just as it disrupted nearly every aspect of American life.” Virginia will hold its 2023 elections, Novak said, “using different maps drawn by the Supreme Court of Virginia in accord with the Constitution of Virginia.” “Accordingly, this federal court cannot usurp the authority that the Constitution grants Virginia over its elections and, therefore, cannot grant the relief requested by plaintiffs,” Novak wrote. “At bottom, plaintiffs claim an injury that defendants did not cause and that the court cannot redress.”</p>

Bailey-Rihn awarded about $98,000 in attorneys’ fees to the liberal watchdog group American Oversight, bringing an end in circuit court to one of four lawsuits the group filed. Vos’s attorney, Ron Stadler, said he was recommending that Vos appeal the ruling. The fees will be paid by taxpayers, which is why the judge said she was not also awarding additional punitive damages against Vos.<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-biden-politics-lawsuits-c41ad1de2dd7f1d5b41ef15536143aae"> Costs to taxpayers</a> for the investigation, including ongoing legal fees, have exceeded $1 million. “I think the people of the state of Wisconsin have been punished enough for this case,” Bailey-Rihn said. “I don’t think it does anyone any good to have punitive damages placed on the innocent people of this state.”</p>
