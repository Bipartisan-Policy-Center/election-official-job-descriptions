							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>What to watch in 2022</strong><br />
<em>2022 is a watershed moment for American democracy</em></p>
<p>By Viviana Perez, senior program associate<br />
<a href="https://democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a></p>
<p>2022 is a watershed moment for American democracy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-6682" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2022-Elections-300x166.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="129" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2022-Elections-300x166.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2022-Elections-768x425.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2022-Elections.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 233px) 100vw, 233px" />The attacks on our democratic institutions, coupled with the recent racial justice movements, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have led to a pivotal juncture in our nation&#8217;s history: will we remain a democracy? Much of this depends on the survival of our election administration system.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance deemed the United States to be a backsliding democracy in 2021. One factor for this<a href="https://www.idea.int/gsod/global-report#chapter-2-democracy-health-check:-an-overview-of-global-trends"> report’s</a> rating is the consideration of ‘clean’ elections on electoral management body (EMB) autonomy and capacity, evidence of voting irregularities, government intimidation during elections, and the extent of electoral competition.</p>
<p>The following questions must be considered if our country is to continue to be the leader of the free world.</p>
<p><em>Will election jurisdictions be able to make use of tools &amp; knowledge amidst threats to democracy?</em><br />
Innovation and urgency have been the silver linings for election administration amidst immense challenges and insufficient resources during the pandemic. With over two years living in a global pandemic, election administrators have increased knowledge to administer elections as safely as <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7614" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/VAED-11.04-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/VAED-11.04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/VAED-11.04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/VAED-11.04.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />possible. However, the ability of election officials to implement safe and fair elections is also contingent on systematic change from elected officials who call for change and legislation to enact more voter centric policies.</p>
<p><em>Will voters maintain options on how to cast a ballot?<br />
</em>The need to provide physical distance for voters who choose to vote in person – and wide berth for those who run our elections – necessitated an increase in early voting options for voters, as well as increased safety procedures for in person voting. According to the Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS), the total number of voters who voted early, absentee or by mail was 57.2 million in 2016. The U.S. Elections Hub estimates 2020 vote early numbers to be 101,453,111—which represents a substantial increase from the prior general election. However, the flexibility of voter options was instituted during the pre-vaccine height of the pandemic and the decision of how voters cast a ballot is not always one made by local election administrators.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Providing voters options is an equity issue. When voters have more options to cast their ballot, more will vote.</p>
<p><em>Will mis- and disinformation continue, and lead to more extrajudicial audits and calls of fraud? Will there be a mass exodus of election officials?</em><br />
2021 saw an increase in rhetoric that citizens should only be able to vote on election day, and that a prolonged voting period or options will lead to security issues and render results fraudulent. In 2021 at least five states went through extrajudicial audits, and dueling actions on observers. Inaccurate claims of fraud, time consuming and expensive procedures, will lead to lack of trust in the electoral process.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7443" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cuyaghoa1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Additionally, the Stewards of Democracy Survey conducted by the Elections &amp; Voting Information Center at Reed College and Democracy Fund, found that 35% of election officials are eligible to retire before the next presidential election. Coupled with the increased threats to the lives of these officials, our nation may be headed towards a mass exodus of election officials. With this in mind, it is key to further the continued improvement and support of the election administration profession—both to ensure longevity of these officials and to create a steady pipeline of new officials into the field long-term.</p>
<p><em>Will election infrastructure be adequately funded?</em><br />
Election jurisdictions have been chronically underfunded. Additional resources are often provided too late in an election cycle to be fully effective and sufficient—especially when provided episodically after a crisis. The lack of funding has prompted an influx of non-governmental funds to election administration, as well as renewed vigor for the increased funding. However, Congress neglected to add more money to fund election infrastructure to the budget. Moreover, Arizona, Kansas and other states have banned private funding that was crucial in providing PPE and other necessary resources in recent elections. An increase in funding – and an established, steady stream of long-term funding that keeps pace with the scale of threats and challenges – is necessary to provide a safe in person voting experience, maintain or upgrade voting equipment as well as a robust cybersecurity procedure.</p>
<p><strong>On the horizon</strong><br />
The 2022 midterm elections include significant Senate elections in Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, and Wisconsin amongst others and tough battles for gubernatorial elections in Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania, and Kansas.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7350" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CARecall-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CARecall-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CARecall.jpeg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Election officials are extraordinarily hard-working public servants who take joy in their work and serve as the face of democracy for many voters. Additionally, there are key players in the election administration space who are rallying to improve the field by doing work as varied as: creating documentaries highlighting the work of election officials; providing support for those interested in helping younger, more politically, racially, and ethnically diverse candidates to enter the field as election officials; and creating training and resources to enable election officials to do their work in the most efficient and effective manner. For example, the Center for Tech and Civic Life creates trainings and resources for election officials and the Elections Group has been providing deep expertise and technical assistance to election jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges and the weight of this current moment, Democracy Fund remains hopeful and focused towards a better future. But in 2020, the heroic effort of election officials across the country, with the support of civil society partners, produced one of the most secure elections in recent history against seemingly insurmountable odds. Democracy Fund believes that together we can step up to protect our democracy in 2022.</p>

This is the end of the 2020 election.”</strong>: Officials in Maricopa County, Arizona released a<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/01/05/maricopa-county-responds-each-cyber-ninjas-election-claim/9083810002/"> 93-page report rebutting claims made by Cyber Ninjas</a>, the company hired by the state Senate to conduct a “forensic audit” of the 2020 presidential election. In a<a href="https://www.kake.com/story/45592419/were-done-this-is-the-end-of-the-2020-election-maricopa-county-officials-rebut-error-plagued-review"> point-by-point response to questions raised by contractors</a>, the report explains. that the contractors made faulty assumptions and false accusations, in part because of mistakes they made during their analysis but also because they were inexperienced and misunderstood how the county and state&#8217;s elections work. &#8220;It&#8217;s my hope this will be the last word on the November 2020 election,&#8221; Supervisor Bill Gates, chairman of the Republican-controlled board, said. While Cyber Ninjas raised questions about more than 50,000 ballots cast in the election, a wider margin than President Joe Biden won in the state, the county&#8217;s analysis of those claims found fewer than 100 instances of potential voter fraud or double-counted ballots. That&#8217;s far fewer than it would have taken to impact the outcome of any race, and within the expectations of an election with nearly 2.1 million voters. After analyzing each claim, the county is referring 37 cases of potential voter fraud to the Arizona attorney general, including 26 potential deceased voters, six voters who may have voted twice, and five voters who may have voted in more than one county. County Elections Director Scott Jarrett said the county is improving some of its processes. Some improvements he and other county staff listed during the meeting include adding another process to better identify double-counted ballots, a new system to check for deceased voters, and changing how it tracks and stores duplicate ballots.</p>

The first phase of the review highlighted election data from four counties — Harris, Dallas, Tarrant and Collin — that showed few discrepancies between electronic and hand counts of ballots in a sample of voting precincts. Those partial manual counts made up a significant portion of the results produced by the secretary of state, which largely focused on routine voter roll maintenance and post-election processes that were already in place before the state launched what it has labeled as a “full forensic audit.” According to the state’s review of the counties’ partial manual counts, which they are already required to conduct under state law, there were few differences between electronic and manual ballot tallies — and counties were able to justify those inconsistencies. Although the secretary of state’s office has dubbed its review a “full forensic audit” of the election, the first phase of the review includes partial manual counts of ballots and security assessments, which all counties are already required to undergo as part of the typical election process. State law requires partial manual counts to be conducted within 72 hours of polls closing after every election. The second phase, which will take place in 2022, will be an examination of election records “to ensure election administration procedures were properly followed.”</p>

A<a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/new-umass-amherst-poll-election-reforms-shows-continued-national-support-expanding"> University of Massachusetts Amherst Poll</a> finds Americans continue to support a wide variety of election reforms, intended to make voting easier, while also maintaining a strong desire for photo ID requirements at voting booths. The poll of 1,000 respondents found majority support for reforms including automatically registering voters (52%), making Election Day a national holiday (58%) and making vote-by-mail a permanent option to all registered voters (54%), all within three points of the results of a similar UMass Poll conducted in April. Sixty percent of respondents also support restoring voting rights to convicted felons who have served their sentences, identical to the response in April’s poll.</p>

Kathy Hochul (D) is proposing a<a href="https://www.localsyr.com/regional-news/hochul-proposes-state-voting-rights-act-expanded-absentee-voting/"> statewide Voting Rights Act</a>. The governor’s would establish a state-level voting rights act that will enhance protections against voter suppression and vote dilution; establish new protections against voter intimidation and deception; improve language access for voters; and require boards of elections in jurisdictions with a history of civil rights violations to obtain pre-clearance for changes to election-related policies and practices. Hochul also called on the Legislature to amend State law to lower the voter registration deadline from 25 days to 10 days before Election Day, which does not require a Constitutional amendment. Additionally, Hochul will urge the Legislature to begin the Constitutional amendment process for no-excuse absentee voting and same-day registration. Hochul also proposed requiring polling places on college campuses. Under the governor’s proposal, whenever a contiguous property of a college or university contains 300 or more registrants, the polling place designated for such election district shall be on such contiguous property or at a location approved by the college or university.</p>

Bruce Griffey (R-Paris) has submitted HB1662 that would have the state revert to<a href="http://1057news.com/2021/12/31/10/49/30/proposed-law-may-revert-tennessee-to-paper-ballots-for-elections/"> paper ballots</a> for elections. Under the bill, voting machines and ballot marking devices would be banned starting with the 2022 elections. County election commissions would instead be required to use only hand-marked paper ballots to be counted using an optical ballot scanner which uses software open to public inspection. In order to make it affordable, the state would absorb at least 50% of each county’s cost in acquiring the machines. The bill would also allow poll watchers to take video of polling places and create security features used on the paper ballots such as watermarks, fluorescence, digital holograms, or other technology.</p>

According to the Milton Independent, The discussion at the selectboard meeting on the issue mostly revolved around giving Milton residents the most amount of opportunity to vote, while taking into consideration the time and money needed for mail-in ballots to occur. In the summer of 2021, Gov. Phil Scott signed legislation making mail-in voting a fixture of Vermont general elections. The law, however, does not apply to primaries or local elections. The new law allows towns to determine this for themselves.</p>

The Arkansas League of Women Voters, immigrant advocacy group Arkansas United and five Arkansas voters sued the state after the General Assembly passed a group of laws that the plaintiffs say make it harder for poor and minority-group citizens to vote. Assistant Attorney General Michael A. Mosley argued in a brief that the four election laws pass constitutional muster and that the lawsuit is not valid because the state has &#8220;sovereign immunity.&#8221; The four laws &#8212; Act 249, Act 728, Act 736 and Act 973 &#8212; were passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature during the legislative session in 2021. Act 249 removes the ability of a voter to obtain a provisional ballot without identification by signing a sworn statement. Act 728 limits people standing within 100 feet of the main entrance of a polling site. The law exempts people who are at a voting site for &#8220;lawful purposes&#8221; such as entering or leaving a building to vote. Act 736 changes how absentee ballots are verified, and Act 973 requires absentee ballots to be dropped off in person to the local county clerk by the close of business on the Friday before election day. In the brief, Mosley representing Arkansas Secretary of State John Thurston and the Arkansas Board of Election Commissioners, said the four laws help address the &#8220;principle of integrity in the electoral process. &#8220;Rather, at most, the laws at issue involve election mechanics, not the franchise itself,&#8221; Mosley wrote. &#8220;The United States Supreme Court has clearly made a distinction between laws like the acts challenged here and laws that actually implicate the right to vote.&#8221; Attorneys for the state also argued that they can&#8217;t be sued because of &#8220;sovereign immunity,&#8221; something a Pulaski County judge said was &#8220;without merit&#8221; in an earlier ruling.</p>

The Maine Libertarian Party has been in protracted lawsuits against the state in an attempt to reform its party membership enrollment laws, which members say disenfranchises their small party. U.S. District Court Judge Lance Walker called the process of un-enrolling members when the party’s numbers fall beneath a certain threshold unconstitutional last fall. The ruling ensures that those members will have a chance to vote under the party’s banner in the upcoming elections. The ruling came just as nominating petitions became available for Maine’s June primaries. The secretary of state’s office must put former Libertarians back in their old party unless they have already chosen another party or request to not be re-added. The office is required to tell members their un-enrollment was unlawful within the next month and give them 45 days to indicate whether they wish to rejoin the party. People can also join the party at their municipal office.</p>

The justice department’s claims are unfounded and baseless.” Ashcroft supports the Texas legislation because it could be a model for other states, including Missouri, on election reform measures.</p>

McCloskey ordered a do-over election to be held on a still-undetermined date in 2022. An attorney for Democrat Jill DeCaro has asked McCloskey to stay his ruling pending appeal.  That would allow DeCaro to be sworn in to the council seat within the next week. McCloskey found that the Statewide Voter Registration System didn’t properly follow boundaries set in the 2011 ward redistricting map put voters from the odd numbered homes on one side of Cymbeline Drive in Ward 2, and the even numbered homes on the opposite side of Cymbeline Drive residing in the Ward 4. Discovery found that 27 voters were assigned the wrong ward and that 17 of those voters cast ballots in last month’s election. “The Court must also consider the public interest at stake,” Antonelli wrote in his brief. “It would be contrary to the public interest for the candidates to spend time and money campaigning for a new election, and to force Middlesex County and its taxpayers to expend its resources, which are already strained because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in preparing and executing an election that may not be necessary depending on the results of the appeal.”</p>

The state Supreme Court has declared there are two paths that an individual justice can take when weighing a request to be removed from hearing a case due to an alleged conflict of interest. It allows a justice to either decide on their own or ask the rest of the court to act on a recusal or disqualification motion. Whichever option is used, the ensuing ruling is final, the order said. According to the AP, resetting of recusal procedures resulted from one of several pending legal challenges to North Carolina&#8217;s photo voter identification law. The order should allow that case, delayed in the summer and while the Supreme Court grappled with whether to alter its recusal standards, to resume soon. Two of the seven justices are the subjects of a motion from lawyers seeking to block voter ID by having them disqualified from the case.</p>

Judge J. Channing Bennett upheld the state&#8217;s action in mid-2020 in Marion County Circuit Court. But a three-judge panel of the Oregon Court of Appeals overturned it in a 2-1 decision released on Dec. 30, 2020.  Exactly one year later, on the final business day of 2021, the Supreme Court upheld the original 2016 decision by then-Secretary of State Jeanne Atkins to exclude signatures from inactive voters.  Justice Thomas Balmer, who wrote for the court, said that voter registration for elections has been required by state law since 1920 and by the Oregon Constitution since 1927. He wrote:  &#8220;Defining and regulating voter registration and verification of registrations has been within the purview of the legislative branch. And this court has issued several decisions squarely holding that voters may sign initiative petitions only if they could legally vote in an election at the time of signing.  &#8220;We conclude that voters with inactive registration, who statutorily may not vote, may not have their signatures counted on initiative petitions either.&#8221;</p>

If upheld, the court’s decision would settle the race for a local court where two candidates are separated by 74 votes. Voters casting ballots by mail are instructed to date the return envelope. Following the ruling, an attorney Democrat Zachary Cohen said it would be appealed to the state’s Supreme Court. Monday’s ruling only dealt with undated mail-in ballots. Four more had dates in the wrong place but were considered moot since the court figured they will not affect the outcome.</p>
<p>Dominion Voting Systems has asked a court to<a href="https://www.pennlive.com/politics/2022/01/pa-gops-voting-machine-inspections-should-be-done-only-by-qualified-labs-company-tells-court.html"> restrict any inspection of its voting machines</a> as part of what Republican lawmakers call a “forensic investigation” of Pennsylvania’s 2020 election to a laboratory that has specific credentials. The voting-system manufacturer filed paperwork in court this week as Republican lawmakers move to inspect Dominion’s machines and software in southern Pennsylvania’s sparsely populated Fulton County using an unaccredited contractor that has no election experience. In its court papers, Dominion requested an order requiring that any inspection be conducted by a federally accredited voting system test lab or a national laboratory used by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. A Commonwealth Court judge has separately given state and county officials until Jan. 10 to work out an agreed-upon set of rules for an inspection.</p>

I will continue to oppose this decision that diminishes our democracy and misconstrues the Texas Constitution,&#8221; Paxton said in a<a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/paxton-asks-court-criminal-appeals-reverse-its-decision-stripping-oag-authority-stop-election-fraud"> statement</a>. “The Court’s decision to suddenly remove our authority to prosecute election fraud can only empower dishonest campaigns to silence voters across the state,” he continued.</p>

According to the investigation, the barrage — averaging at least 10,000 posts a day, a scale not reported previously — turned the groups into incubators for the baseless claims supporters of President Donald Trump voiced as they stormed the Capitol, demanding he get a second term. Many posts portrayed Biden’s election as the result of widespread fraud that required extraordinary action — including the use of force — to prevent the nation from falling into the hands of traitors. Although Facebook has yet to turn documentation over to the congressional committee investigating January 6, the ProPublica-Post investigation, which analyzed millions of posts between Election Day and Jan. 6 and drew on internal company documents and interviews with former employees, provides the clearest evidence yet, according to The Post,  that Facebook played a critical role in the spread of false narratives that fomented the violence of Jan. 6.</p>

Researcher reviews transcripts of nearly 1,500 episodes from 20 of the most popular political podcasts. Among episodes released between the election and the Jan. 6 riot, about half contained election misinformation, according to the analysis. In some weeks, 60 percent of episodes mentioned the election fraud conspiracy theories tracked by Brookings. Those included false claims that software glitches interfered with the count, that fake ballots were used, and that voting machines run by Dominion Voting Systems were rigged to help Democrats. Those kinds of theories gained currency in Republican circles and would later be leveraged to justify additional election audits across the country.</p>
