														<p><strong>Understanding Why People Believe Conspiracy Theories<br />
</strong><em>A Brief Media Literacy Lesson</em></p>
<p>By Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, executive director<br />
National Association for Media Literacy Education</p>
<p>Think about this:</p>
<p>Each day<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/data-generated-each-day-wide.html"> 500 million tweets</a>,<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/"> 294 billion emails</a>,<a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/facebook-statistics/"> 4 million gigabytes</a> of Facebook data, and<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/whatsapp-65-billion-messages-sent-each-day-and-more-than-2-billion-minutes-of-calls/"> 65 billion WhatsApp messages</a> are sent and<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/259477/hours-of-video-uploaded-to-youtube-every-minute/"> 720,000 hours</a> of new content is uploaded to YouTube.*</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3252" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/PS_Woman-Using-Social-Media-on-Phone-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />Those are astounding numbers! No wonder so many of us are having trouble navigating the fire hose of information coming at us 24/7. Sometimes it can feel like we are just barely keeping our head above water. With the amount of information available, it can be hard to decipher what information is credible. It also makes us more perceptible to falling for false information, even conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, we have seen a growth in the spread of conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories used to have a place on the fringe of society, but they have become mainstream and are having real impact on our world. For many of us, falling for a conspiracy theory can seem almost ridiculous. However, they are powerful and can be appealing for those looking for ways to make sense out of situations that are complicated and unsettling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8438" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NAMLE-300x93.png" alt="" width="300" height="93" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NAMLE-300x93.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NAMLE.png 538w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Let’s look at why people embrace conspiracy theories. Using<a href="https://newslit.org/educators/resources/conspiratorial-thinking/"> The News Literacy Project</a> resource as a guide, here are 5 reasons why conspiracy theories work.</p>
<p>1)     Conspiracy theories are compelling. These theories are often far more interesting and exciting than the actual narrative. As human beings we love stories and conspiracy theories can be fascinating stories that easily hook people who are looking for an alternate explanation of an outcome or situation they wish were different. (Say, like an election result.)</p>
<p>2)    Conspiracy theories provide simplified explanations of complex issues. Social issues are complicated and often very hard to wrap our heads around. False and captivating narratives can simplify a situation and provide someone or something to blame for the problem.</p>
<p>3)    Conspiracy believers utilize motivated reasoning. Those that believe conspiracy theories only seek out information that confirms their beliefs. Also referred to as identity protective cognition, this is the tendency of individuals to unconsciously dismiss evidence that does not reflect their beliefs. Conspiracy theories play on this tendency.</p>
<p>4)   Conspiracy theories activate our cognitive biases. Conspiracy theories take advantage of common errors in the way we think. For example, our brains look for and perceive patterns that don’t necessarily exist. This is referred to as illusory pattern perception.  This is especially true when things don’t turn out the way we want them to. Humans also tend to believe we have a better understanding of the world than we do. This is defined as illusion of explanatory depth.</p>
<p>5)    Conspiracy theories provide people with a sense of belonging. Humans long for community and we are devoted to our group. Many conspiracy theory communities provide individuals with connection and purpose, especially those that don’t have that connection and purpose elsewhere in their lives. The closer one is connected to their group the more likely they are to believe in what the group believes. With the increased use of social media platforms for communication, it is easier than ever to find a group of like-minded individuals.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8655" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lies-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lies-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lies-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/lies.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Reviewing these reasons, one may be able to better understand why people find conspiracy theories appealing. We&#8217;re constantly processing information every moment of every day, and we look for patterns to make sense of it all.</p>
<p>When it comes to politics, elections, and our democracy, you can add intense loyalty, strong emotions, and political manipulation to the mix. Blend in an isolating pandemic and social media filter bubbles and you have the recipe for conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>So, the next time you come across someone who believes a conspiracy theory remind yourself that, while you may find it somewhat absurd, there are reasons for their belief. Understanding what those reasons are can lead to a more empathetic, productive conversation which is better for us all.</p>

Under the<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/s2554"> VOTES Act</a>, the secretary of the commonwealth must prepare posters explaining voting rights and procedures<a href="https://boltsmag.org/massachusetts-law-expands-voting-access-in-jails/"> for jail officials</a> to “display in prominent locations” inside their facilities, as well as written forms to distribute to everyone inside who may be eligible to vote. The law also directs jails to “ensure the receipt, private voting, where possible, and return of mail ballots” for incarcerated people and prohibits jail staff from opening and inspecting any completed mail ballots “unless it is to investigate reasonable suspicion of a prohibited activity.” It also requires sheriffs to track the number of people incarcerated in their jails who sought to vote, any complaints related to voting issues and the outcome of those requests. “I think this bill does an excellent job reaching into those who have been forgotten in voting and it gives them the ability to have their voices be heard,” Corey “Al-Ameen” Patterson, a formerly incarcerated person and advocate for the new law, told Bolts.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8651" src="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sheriff-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sheriff-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sheriff-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sheriff.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Bad Cop</strong>: The Associated Press had a piece this week about the<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/conspiracy-promoting-sheriffs-claim-vast-election-authority/"> outsized role some conspiracy-promoting sheriffs have in elections</a>. Elected sheriffs in Kansas, Michigan and Wisconsin have tasked deputies with investigating alleged election fraud. They have also accused state elections officials of violating election laws. “We’ve been educating ourselves about elections,” Johnson County, Kansas Sheriff Calvin Hayden told a gathering in Las Vegas recently. “I’ve sent my detectives through — I’ve got a cyber guy. I sent him through to start evaluating what’s going on with the machines.” “The danger of anyone embracing a conspiracy theory is the loss of confidence in election results,” said Chris Harvey, the former state elections director in Georgia. “It’s an added danger if it’s law enforcement. Their job is to enforce laws and maintain order. If they are seen as not having confidence in what’s going on, it’s just going to further trickle down into society.”</p>

According to MLive, Kent County Clerk Lisa Posthumus Lyons and Ottawa County Clerk Justin Roebuck said that no one from their offices were involved in the tests that resulted in the erroneous data that appeared online. “Our teams have received calls and messages this morning concerning election results data that has been posted on local media sites,” the statement reads. “We want to be very clear that results posted on these sites were not provided by official election administrators, nor were our offices involved in any way.” At least two Michigan television stations published the data sent out by the Associated Press to the news outlets to test election systems over the weekend, Roebuck told MLive/The Grand Rapids Press about the error. The Ottawa County clerk said he was inundated with calls and text messages starting early Monday morning from people who were concerned after they saw what they thought were early election results published online. Roebuck said misinformation can damage public confidence in the county’s elections systems. He said Michigan voters can rest assured that the county elections systems have thorough checks and balances in place to ensure that official election results are certified and accurate.</p>

According to Supervisor of Elections Joyce Griffin, the Marathon branch of the supervisor’s office has lost three employees in recent months to moves and retirements and no one has applied to fill the jobs. “I just don’t know what to say,” Griffin told Keys Weekly. “It breaks my heart to close that office, especially at this time of year, but I have done everything I possibly can and I cannot find anybody to work.” Griffin plans to reach out to past poll workers to see if any are interested in working for the office through November’s general election, but recognizes this is only a short-term solution. “I’m not the only one suffering from this, but you would think someone in Marathon would love to have a county job,” she said. Though the office previously functioned as a drop-off site for absentee and vote-by-mail ballots, Griffin said a legal requirement to account for ballots from a “secure ballot intake station” on the Supervisor of Elections’ computer system on a daily basis precludes her from extending the drop-off service while the office is closed. The Marathon office will remain closed until it becomes an early voting site from Aug. 8-20. Anyone looking for a job in the Florida Keys should reach out to Joyce!</p>

Titled the <a href="http://steil.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/steil.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Section-by-Section%20GOP%20Election%20Bill.pdf">American Confidence in Elections Act</a>, the bill announced by House Administration Committee ranking member Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) is largely crafted around the principle that states have the primary role in elections. The GOP bill establishes a standards board to serve as a best-practices forum, including on mail ballots, signature verification procedures, timely ballot counting and post-election audits. The bill imposes a number of requirements to ensure only eligible American citizens vote, including penalizing states’ ability to receive federal funds for election systems if they allow noncitizen voting in state or local elections. A federal judge last month struck down a New York City law that would have allowed noncitizen residents to vote in city elections, though Republicans have repeatedly pointed to noncitizen voting risks. A section first introduced by Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.), co-chair of the Election Integrity Caucus, would prohibit 501(c)3 nonprofit organizations from directly funding election boards.The bill also prohibits states to use funds on election administration for federal offices unless it includes certain restrictions on who can collect ballots. Only postal employees, family members, household members, caregivers and authorized election officials could collect and transmit ballots for others.</p>

John Carney (D) signed<a href="https://www.delawarepublic.org/politics-government/2022-07-22/carney-signs-election-reform-bills-but-vote-by-mail-provision-will-likely-face-gop-lawsuit"> two election reform bills</a>, enabling Delawareans to register to vote on election day and to vote by mail. The two bills passed this spring despite firm Republican opposition. Democrats previously introduced a constitutional amendment to allow no-excuse absentee voting in 2019. It passed with bipartisan support that year but failed to garner any Republican votes in following session. Constitutional amendments must pass with a two-thirds majority in two consecutive sessions to become law. Absentee voting rules are defined in Delaware’s constitution. Vote-by-mail supporters argue while both approaches expand voting access in similar ways, voting by mail is a voting methodology, which lawmakers can change.</p>

County commissioners are requesting that the New Mexico Legislature make several changes to current election code to, as the resolution states, “enhance the faith of the public in election outcomes.”  The resolution states that there “have been many changes in election laws over the past decade to increase voter participation.” It goes on to say that “some of these changes have increased the risk of election fraud,” though it does not cite any examples or offer evidence of election fraud. The changes proposed in the resolution include requiring voters to show a photo identification to cast a ballot for both in-person and absentee voting. Other changes include prohibiting the use of ballot drop boxes and an “enhanced chain of custody process” for absentee ballots, according to the resolution approved June 22 during a regular meeting of the Sandoval County Board of Commissioners. “New Mexico has long struggled to effectively and efficiently remove inactive voters from the voter rolls,” the resolution states and, based on this claim, commissioners are asking the state to use “data-matching software” to purge voter rolls of anyone who has moved or died.</p>

Act 66 of 2022 would require enough ballots to be printed and supplied to each precinct for 50% of all registered voters in that precinct in each party for a primary election, and 100% of all registered voters in that precinct for a general election. Each of these numbers could be reduced by the number of registered voters in an election district that have requested an absentee or mail-in ballot. The law will take effect in 60 days. “Last May, voting precincts in several areas of the state, including Fayette and Westmoreland counties which I represent, actually ran out of ballots for people who showed up to vote in person,” Warner, R-Perryopolis, said. “That is simply unacceptable. This law will ensure it never happens again.”</p>

Blanchard’s lawsuit asks the court to bar the use of electronic vote-counters used in all 67 Alabama counties and require a hand count of ballots in the general election in November. The lawsuit claims, in part, that the use of the electronic voting machines violates due process because the machines are capable of being connected to the internet and hacked. Lawyers with the AG’s office said the court has no jurisdiction over what they characterized as hypothetical claims. “Plaintiffs do not claim that their ballots will likely be miscounted,” the motion to dismiss says. “They allege only that someone’s ballot might be miscounted, if a voting machine is ever hooked up to the internet and if someone hacks it.”</p>

The lawsuit pits two high-profile candidates against each other, Republican candidate for governor Kari Lake and Democrat candidate Katie Hobbs, who is also Secretary of State. Lake, along with Republican Secretary of State candidate Mark Finchem, is suing the Arizona Secretary of State’s office and Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, claiming tabulation machines cannot be trusted and should not be used to count votes. The plaintiffs are asking Tuchi to order the removal of electronic machines from elections so Arizona’s two largest counties employ a hand count instead. Tuchi did not indicate when he will make a decision about the injunction request. He said the plaintiffs have one week to respond to issues raised in the hearing.</p>

Under questioning, former clerk Donna Loglisci said that in 2015, she gave absentee ballots to John Mallozzi, who was the chairman of the Stamford Democratic City Committee at the time, and two other people even though the ballots were for voters other than them. She admitted that she broke the law by doing so. Under state law, a town clerk is supposed to mail or hand an absentee ballot to the person who applied for it, though there are exceptions for situations like a person being hospitalized. Loglisci is not facing charges. In court, Loglisci said that Mallozzi told her that those voters were unable to get out to vote because of sickness or other reasons. Mallozzi has been charged with 14 counts of second-degree forgery and 14 counts of committing false statements in absentee balloting. Those felony charges are tied to the 2015 city elections. Since his arrest in early 2019, Mallozzi has pleaded not guilty.</p>

John Carney. The two bills passed this spring despite firm Republican opposition. Democrats previously introduced a constitutional amendment to allow no-excuse absentee voting in 2019. It passed with bipartisan support that year but failed to garner any Republican votes in following session. Constitutional amendments must pass with a two-thirds majority in two consecutive sessions to become law. Sen. Colin Bonini (R- Dover) contends the vote-by-mail bill was a partisan workaround by Democrats intended to stave off a possible surge in GOP voters this fall. &#8220;The Constitution provides you must vote in person on election day unless you qualify under very limited conditions to vote absentee. Mail in voting clearly violates that requirement, as it allows remote voting without declaring or meeting any of those limited conditions,&#8221; said Delaware GOP Chair Jane Brady in a statement. &#8220;The Delaware Constitution also provides that a period must be provided for new voters to register to vote but requires that the period end 10 days before the election.”</p>

McBurney barred Willis from building a case against Burt Jones, a state senator running for lieutenant governor, after she hosted a fundraiser backing Democratic candidate Charlie Bailey in his runoff against another Democratic challenger who ultimately lost, Kwanza Hall.  McBurney said Willis’ taking part in the fundraiser was “harmful” to the integrity of the investigation. “Any decision the district attorney makes about Senator Jones in connection with the grand jury investigation is necessarily infected by it,” the judge wrote, adding that any effort to focus specifically on Jones, even if it were justified, would prompt “entirely reasonable concerns of politically motivated persecution.”</p>

The decision directed a trial court judge to order Secretary of State Scott Schwab to reverse the software change in the state’s voter registration system so that it can again produce a statewide report on provisional ballots. Voters receive provisional ballots if they don’t appear to be registered, fail to present required identification or try to vote at the wrong polling place. Their ballots are set aside to be reviewed later by local officials, who determine whether they will be counted.  Davis Hammet is founder of the voting-rights group Loud Light, which helps voters fix issues that led them to cast provisional ballots so that their votes are counted. It also researches voting-rights issues and lobbies the Legislature.  Hammet first sought the information after the 2018 general election, then again repeatedly in 2020. Schwab’s office provided it free of charge until the fall of 2020, when Schwab had the vendor maintaining the voter registration system turn off the feature that produces the reports. “The report feature may have been of no use to the Secretary but it was useful to Hammet and the public,” Judge Stephen Hill wrote for the three-member appeals panel. “And that is the point of open public records.”</p>

Moses<a href="https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/judge-strikes-down-election-law-targeting-18-year-old-voters/article_531dea41-a884-5b1c-950a-5502e69d50d2.html"> struck down a Republican-backed law preventing anyone who turns 18 before Election Day</a> from getting a ballot before their birthday, finding that it infringes on young Montanans&#8217; right to vote. Moses partially ruled in favor of a coalition of youth groups that challenged the law, along with other election-related legislation, last year. The group includes Montana Youth Action, the Forward Montana Foundation and the Montana Public Interest Research Group. House Bill 506 was passed near the end of the 2021 legislative session, where it got far more attention for a last-minute provision grafted onto the bill, which sought to change the way the state’s congressional redistricting process works. But it also prohibited voters from receiving or turning in a ballot until they reach voting age, even if they will be 18 by Election Day. In defending the new law, Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen had argued HB 506 was necessary &#8220;to ensure that only qualified electors were receiving ballots and mailing them in.&#8221; Moses noted an earlier form of the legislation would have allowed those voters to submit ballots in advance of their birthdays, but required that election officials wait until they had turned 18 before processing and counting their vote. &#8220;The version of HB 506 that the Legislature ultimately passed arbitrarily subjects a subgroup of the electorate to different requirements and irrationally forecloses an avenue of voting available to all others in the electorate,&#8221; Moses wrote. He found that the law failed to meet the requirement that it be &#8220;narrowly tailored&#8221; to its rationale, in order to avoid unnecessarily infringing on a fundamental right.</p>

The VoteRef.com website provides searchable access to voter registration records by name and street addresses, often indicating when people voted in past elections. The<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-new-mexico-albuquerque-voter-registration-452eb307179b39ea730c97132c9e87b4"> online records</a> do not say for which candidates the people voted or how they voted on initiatives. Party affiliation is listed for voters in some states but not all. New Mexico election regulators contend that the effort violates state restrictions on the purchase and dissemination of voter registration records — and is likely to discourage voter participation because people may opt out if they know that some of their voting information is being made public. New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat, in March referred the matter the attorney general’s office for possible prosecution of the Voter Reference Foundation, which published New Mexico registration records online at the time after obtaining them through an out-of-state business. State law restricts the use of voter registration information to political campaigning and election- or government-related activities. The judge’s order blocks prosecution while the case advances toward trial and said that the Voter Reference Foundation is likely to prevail in its claim as the victim of viewpoint discrimination by election regulators. Browning said New Mexico state law “does not prohibit Voter Reference — or any organization — from posting voter data online.” Following the ruling, the foundation said it would post New Mexico voter rolls online starting this week.</p>

It is the latest fight over voting laws in a political battleground state. The lawsuit comes barely two months before voters can send in mail-in ballots in the fall election featuring high-profile contests for governor and the U.S. Senate. The suit, filed in the Commonwealth Court by 14 state Republican lawmakers, contends that the court must invalidate the law because of a provision written into it that says it is “void” if any of its requirements are struck down in court. The lawsuit says the “non-severability” provision was triggered in a May 20 decision by a panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concerning mail-in ballots in a Lehigh County judicial race in November. The ballots in question lacked handwritten dates on the return envelopes, as required in the law. In the decision, the panel found that a handwritten date has no bearing on a voter&#8217;s eligibility and said it would violate voters&#8217; civil rights to throw out their ballots in that election simply because they lacked a handwritten date. The panel pointed out that ballots with incorrect dates had been counted. An appeal by the Republican candidate in the race is pending in the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

Brett Simpson announced he filed the suit in Clark County Superior Court against Kimsey, Clark County Elections Supervisor Cathie Garber, and the county as a whole. The suit intends to prevent the county from counting votes in the primary election for the auditor’s race, which features both Simpson and Kimsey. Simpson argues that because there are only two candidates for the election and the position is nonpartisan, it should not be on the ballot per state law. The auditor’s office went from a partisan to nonpartisan position earlier this year after county voters approved an amendment to the Clark County Charter. The change also affects other elected officials in county government, like the assessor and treasurer. The lawsuit cites communication between Kimsey and a registered voter who asked about the inclusion of several races for county-level elected positions featuring two or fewer candidates on the primary ballot. Those included the county assessor, auditor, clerk, prosecuting attorney and treasurer. The suit cites state law which states “(n)o primary may be held for any single position in any nonpartisan office if, after the last day allowed for candidates to withdraw, there are no more than two candidates filed for the position.” The lawsuit requests that votes cast in the primary election for the auditor’s race be disregarded. The suit does not pertain to other county-level races with two or fewer candidates.</p>

The voters, who are each unable to move their arms or legs or have severely limited mobility, argue the court ruling violates the U.S. Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act. &#8220;Without ballot-return assistance, many voters with disabilities, including Plaintiffs, would be unable to access Wisconsin’s absentee-voting program, rendering this statutorily provided method of voting unavailable to qualified voters with disabilities, even while it would remain available to other Wisconsin voters,&#8221; the lawsuit alleges.  The lawsuit is brought by Law Forward, a voting rights-focused legal firm. The plaintiffs are asking a judge to allow them to have caretakers return ballots to clerks&#8217; offices, citing a statement Wisconsin Elections Commission administrator Meagan Wolfe made earlier this month, when she interpreted the state Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling to mean voters must return their own ballots.</p>

The motion requesting dismissal argues that plaintiff Tim Newcomb, an attorney who has expertise in the Wyoming Constitution, has not been harmed by the law and therefore lacks standing to bring the challenge. “Put simply, Newcomb fails to allege any fact that indicate a genuine interest in this case,” the state’s memorandum says. “Newcomb has not alleged that he has or will suffer any harm.” The law, which requires voters to show ID at the polls, was passed in the 2021 legislative session and has been in effect for roughly a year. The upcoming midterm elections will be the first major elections in Wyoming where voters will have to bring identification. The state’s voters have long had to show a photo ID when registering, a provision the lawsuit does not challenge. The lawsuit, brought by Newcomb and his attorney Charles Pelkey, a former Democratic state lawmaker, alleges the statute is inconvenient and unnecessary. “(The voter ID law) trammels the constitutional right essential to suffrage both in passage and operation,” the suit states. This suit represents one of the first attempts to legally challenge the voter ID law on the basis of the state’s constitution.</p>
