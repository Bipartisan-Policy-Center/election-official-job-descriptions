<em>How Qualitative Approaches Helps Research Understand Local Election Administration </em></p>
<p>By <a href="https://blogs.reed.edu/paul-gronke/">Paul Gronke</a><br />
Professor of Political Science, Reed College<br />
Director, Elections &amp; Voting Information Center</p>
<p>Welcome to this second article in this three-part series from the <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/">Elections &amp; Voting Information Center (EVIC) at Reed College</a> highlighting developments in election science and the individuals conducting this critical work helps us to understand, improve, and advance the work of local election officials (LEOs).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7615" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04-768x511.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WAED.11.04.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Researchers <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/person/grace-gordon/">Grace Gordon</a>, policy analyst with the <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/policy-area/elections/">Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC)</a>, and <a href="https://www.reed.edu/faculty-profiles/profiles/manson-paul.html">Paul Manson</a>, visiting assistant professor of political science at Reed College and research director at EVIC, are the subjects of this week’s article which recaps our recent chat about how they got involved in elections work, policy lessons from their recent research, and the value of “qualitative data” (non-numerical information drawn from first-hand observation, personal interviews, focus groups, and text responses from surveys) for helping us learn more about the people who conduct elections in the United States.</p>
<p>Paul Gronke (PG): Let’s start by discussing how you both got involved in elections work.</p>
<p>Grace Gordon (GG): My path to elections work was somewhat accidental. While getting my <a href="https://mdp.berkeley.edu">Master of Development Practice</a> degree at Berkeley, I took a class that included a unit on cybersecurity and elections. I found it to be quite interesting and decided to do my capstone thesis on the online harassment of election officials. I quickly expanded that to include all types of harassment and threats that election officials experienced during the 2020 election. Guidance on this work from Kim Alexander, president and founder of the <a href="https://www.calvoter.org/">California Voter Foundation</a> (CVF) and <a href="https://www.co.shasta.ca.us/index/clerk/about-clerk">Cathy Darling Allen</a>, Shasta County (California) Clerk and Registrar of Voters and CVF Board Chair was invaluable. And as I was doing my interviews with election officials, I realized how incredible the people are who work in elections &#8211; and how much I enjoy this work &#8211; so I decided to stick around. The final product of my capstone, <a href="http://calvoter.org/harassment">Documenting and Addressing Harassment of Election Officials,</a> is published on CVF’s website. That’s what led me to working with CVF, EVIC, and now BPC.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6960" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AAUM4-300x194.png" alt="" width="300" height="194" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AAUM4-300x194.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AAUM4.png 578w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Paul Manson (PM): My path to elections was not quite as accidental as Grace’s. I was drawn into elections research as part of my PhD program in political science at Portland State University (PSU) where I served as Research Director for PSU’s <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/center-for-public-service/">Center for Public Service</a>. Our center director was former Oregon Secretary of State Phil Keisling, who kicked off a lot of the vote-by-mail conversations we&#8217;ve had in the elections community over the past couple of decades. Phil and I would get together and chat about how to assess the impact of voting by mail. (Incidentally, Phil went on to found the <a href="https://voteathome.org/about-us/">National Vote at Home Institute where he currently serves on its board of directors</a>.) That was my entry point, and then it became more formalized when I joined EVIC as a survey specialist to help administer our first <a href="https://democracyfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2019_DemocracyFund_StewardsOfDemocracy.pdf">Democracy Fund / EVIC at Reed College Local Election Official (LEO) Survey for the 2018 election</a>. You’ve been stuck with me ever since, Paul!</p>
<p>PG: Grace, I know your interviews with LEOs touched on sensitive topics. How did you manage this difficult process?</p>
<p>GG: Like you said, Paul, the interviews were difficult. I was asking questions about threats and harassment and the impacts that they had on election officials in 2020. Looking back, I think that it&#8217;s hard to ask questions to strangers which are personal and can expose their vulnerability. Just look at some of the responses [shown below] that I highlighted in my report. Building trust and rapport was important, as was approaching these conversations from a place of care, empathy, and kindness. I’m thankful that the election officials with whom I spoke were willing to talk to me even though I was a graduate student and new to this space. It was a challenging experience for all of us and demonstrated that election officials have a wonderful ability to build connections, in spite of incredible stress and challenges that come with their jobs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard and been told that I&#8217;m going to be picked up at any time and thrown in jail.&#8221;</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&#8220;[I received] voicemails that said, &#8216;You&#8217;re going to rot in hell,&#8217; &#8216;Don&#8217;t ever send me one of those damn things [vote by mail ballots] again,&#8217; and &#8216;You&#8217;re going to get yours.'&#8221;</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&#8220;A very few people left voicemails that concluded with some kind of threat like, &#8216;You&#8217;ll be sorry if you don&#8217;t,&#8217; or &#8216;We&#8217;re coming for you if you don&#8217;t.'&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>PG: Paul, tell us about some of the other work you do outside of the election space.</p>
<p>PM: I conduct public opinion research on environmental policy issues and <a href="https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/npi_research/2/">disaster planning</a>–essentially, questions about how the Pacific Northwest can prepare for a massive earthquake. I really see a lot of similarities between this work and my work in the elections space. Election administration and disaster preparedness are both administered locally, but with national impacts. They come down to local choices, personal perspectives, and whether we take science and expertise seriously.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-6291" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GA-Recount-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="175" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GA-Recount-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GA-Recount-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GA-Recount.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px" />PG: Let’s discuss the policy implications of your research. Grace, what would you say are the primary takeaways from your report?</p>
<p>GG: I think that the main takeaway is the desperate need for consistent funding in election administration. There is also a need for protections for election officials, including law enforcement protections. While there is a lot of work being done at the state and local levels on this issue, in addition to discussions at the federal level, much more focus is needed. Community- and network-building are also extremely important. The importance of state associations and continuing to bolster and support those networks cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Lastly, the massive, thorny problem of combating mis-, dis-, and mal-information, which is going to continue to present a major problem going forward as our whole democracy works to grapple with this overarching issue.</p>
<p>PG: Paul, the paper that you presented at the recent <a href="https://spsa.net">Southern Political Science Association</a> conference, <a href="https://evic.reed.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SPSA-January-2022-One-Change-Paper.pdf">The Stewards Speak: “One Change” to Improve Election Administration</a>, and on which Grace also serves as co-author, is more traditional political science work. Are there policy lessons from this work?</p>
<p>PM: Absolutely! Echoing Grace, funding and resources were at the top of the list of things that LEOs mentioned when asked what “one change” could be made to improve elections. Resources can mean many things, however. We saw this with the shift to voting by mail as some LEOs told us that the resource needed in 2020 was physical space to store the paper. Broadly speaking, however, funding, resources, and capacity were the number one concern, voiced in different ways by different LEOs [shown below].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8194" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-23-at-10.45.12-AM-1024x608.png" alt="" width="640" height="380" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-23-at-10.45.12-AM-1024x608.png 1024w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-23-at-10.45.12-AM-300x178.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-23-at-10.45.12-AM-768x456.png 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-23-at-10.45.12-AM.png 1318w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The second concern that jumps out in the LEO comments is what the public administration field calls “vertical relations.” Simply put, this is a desire among LEOs for more engagement with the rulemaking and legislative processes. Grounded knowledge about the nuts and bolts of elections can help inform choices being made at all levels. Finding ways to have early and regular engagement with LEOs in the policy making process is key.</p>
<p>The third takeaway is one we have referenced before in our <a href="https://democracyfund.org/idea/how-local-election-officials-prepared-to-serve-voters-during-the-pandemic/">LEO Survey reports</a>: there is an enormous level of diversity among LEOs in terms of jurisdiction size, legal environments, and consequently, the problems they face. LEOs work in jurisdictions with over a quarter million voters and less than 5,000 voters. These are different worlds with different concerns, but they are united in wanting to do their jobs well and support democracy.</p>
<p>PG: I want to turn to qualitative research, which both of you did in your papers. <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/electionline-weekly/2022/03-03/">In our first article of this electionline series</a>, we profiled scholars doing complex quantitative analysis. Paul, why does it matter that we also have a qualitative perspective?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6024" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ballotcounting-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ballotcounting-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ballotcounting-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ballotcounting.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />PM: I don’t think it’s useful to create false divides between quantitative and qualitative research. Sometimes we treat the first as rigorous and objective and the other as casual and subjective. In reality, qualitative research can be highly rigorous, and both Grace and I were very rigorous in our approach. Qualitative research is also very important when conducting research in areas which are experiencing rapid change. We know that in elections, for example, it’s sometimes hard to predict what will arise. That makes it difficult for a quantitative researcher to construct the right survey question or build the right analysis tool when they aren’t even sure of the specific issue. A qualitative, hands-on approach to research can help to identify emerging problems and surface issues that may be initially hard to measure. Qualitative research allows for local election officials to lead the research.</p>
<p>PG: Grace, what are you working on at BPC currently, and what do you see coming up in 2022?</p>
<p>GG: My role at BPC focuses on federal election reforms. The most recent paper that we issued is a collaboration with four other nonprofit think tanks across the political spectrum. In <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/achievable-election-reform/">Prioritizing Achievable Federal Election Reform</a>, we showed what it can look like when people come together and work to bridge divides. This paper shows that there is room for bipartisan consensus on election reforms and best practices in election administration. I&#8217;m also working on a paper with the <a href="https://electionreformers.org/">Election Reformers Network</a> called The Dangers of Partisan Incentives for Election Officials, an issue that I’m continuing to follow. Finally, BPC is spending a lot of time on the funding issue, and I hope action will occur at the federal level.</p>
<p>PG: Paul, what&#8217;s coming up next for you aside from midterm exams at Reed?</p>
<p>PM: EVIC is gearing up for the 2022 LEO Survey. Additionally, we hope to do some retrospective work on what will be four years of LEO Survey data, looking at trends over time. It&#8217;s been a busy four years and it’s not slowing down! Outside of the election research field, I am also working with <a href="https://www.reed.edu/poli_sci/faculty/koski.html">Chris Koski at Reed College</a> to wrap up a national survey that assesses perspectives on various policy tools to address climate change.</p>
<p>In closing, I offer many thanks to Paul and Grace for the wonderful conversation, and to Mindy and electionline for this opportunity to highlight them. In our final article in this three-part series, we’ll talk with another group of election science researchers about their work. Thanks for reading!</p>

							<h2>NIST Voting Accessiblity Publication</h2>
														<p><strong>NIST finalizes recommendations on removing barriers for voters with disabilities<br />
</strong><em>Response to White House EO, provides insights to improve accessibility for voters.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6795" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NIST-300x138.png" alt="" width="300" height="138" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NIST-300x138.png 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NIST.png 334w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />To help improve access to voting, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has finalized its publication outlining barriers that limit the ability of people with disabilities to vote privately and independently — as well as recommending approaches for addressing them.</p>
<p>The publication, titled Promoting Access to Voting: Recommendations for Addressing Barriers to Private and Independent Voting for People with Disabilities (<a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1273">NIST Special Publication 1273</a>), constitutes NIST’s response to the March 7, 2021, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/03/10/2021-05087/promoting-access-to-voting">Executive Order (EO) 14019 on Promoting Access to Voting</a>. NIST developed the report following an initial<a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/06/nist-seeks-public-input-removing-barriers-voting-people-disabilities"> request for information</a> and a subsequent request for comments on the<a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2021/10/nist-draft-publication-addresses-removing-barriers-voters-disabilities"> draft version</a>, both of which drew many responses from the public.</p>
<p>“We received 387 relevant comments from 64 different respondents to the draft,” said Kerrianne Buchanan, a NIST social scientist and one of the report’s authors. “It was a diverse group ranging from disability advocacy groups to voting technology vendors. We also heard from about 20 individuals who shared their experiences with the voting process.”</p>
<p>Buchanan said that the comments served primarily to clarify and expand on points the draft version had included.</p>
<p>“We made no major changes to the overall structure of the document as a result of the comments,” Buchanan said. “No one indicated we had overlooked any key barriers. The public input was very thoughtful and helpful to us in creating a final report that refined our terminology and emphasized how certain barriers might apply to specific groups of voters. It affirmed our development process.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5810" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ADA30-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ADA30-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ADA30-768x513.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ADA30.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />One of the core assertions the NIST authors encountered during the publication’s development was that many barriers exist for voters across a wide range of disabilities. The publication identifies about two dozen specific barriers, ranging from limitations of current voting technology in prioritizing accessibility to lack of effective training for poll workers regarding the needs of voters with disabilities.</p>
<p>As with the draft, the final version is organized into sections that present different classes of barriers followed by potential means of addressing them. Section 2 concerns several systemic barriers that people with disabilities may encounter across the voting process. Sections 3 to 7 each focus on a specific part of the voting process mentioned by name in <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2021-05087/p-29">Section 7 of the EO</a>. These include voter registration and the National Mail Voter Registration Form; vote-by-mail; use of voting technology for in-person voting; voting at polling locations; and training and documentation for poll workers.</p>
<p>Readers may be interested in the newly added introductory Executive Summary as well as Appendix IV, which condenses all the barriers and recommendations into three pages, making it easier to find more details on a given topic in the main text.</p>
<p>The publication also makes recommendations for how to address the issues it raises. Section 2 offers specific actions that state/local election officials can take, including establishing formal partnerships with the disability community and providing information through a variety of channels and accessible formats.</p>
<p>“We also acknowledge that to really promote access to voting, all stakeholders should be at the table together to enact many of the recommendations,” Buchanan said. “We make recommendations where multidisciplinary research teams can improve voting technology to prioritize accessibility.”</p>
<p>The finalized document is<a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1273"> available here</a>.</p>

The committee issued a letter to the head of EchoMail, one of the contractors involved in Arizona’s partisan ballot review, requesting the private company produce documents and information regarding its forensic “audit” of by the end of March. The committee said it is looking into potential intimidation by volunteers from a conspiracist group who are going door to door canvassing voters in Otero County and asking intrusive questions. The canvass is already underway, according to lawmakers, and more than 60 county residents have contacted state and local officials expressing concerns about interactions with the canvassers. The committee’s letter was penned to EchoMail founder V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai, who has previously participated in advancing conspiracy theories about the 2020 election as well as his own loss in a Massachusetts state Senate race. The House Oversight Committee said EchoMail has until March 31 to respond to its letter and hand over the documents requested in the New Mexico probe.  “The Committee is investigating whether your company’s audit and canvass in New Mexico illegally interferes with Americans’ right to vote by spreading disinformation about elections and intimidating voters,” the letter said.</p>

It’s also known for recounts. In 2020 the Legislature  gave counties the option of using a feature of voting systems to conduct more streamlined recounts. Instead of scanning every paper ballot and manually recounting a fraction of those ballots, counties could use<a href="https://thefulcrum.us/Elections/Voting/florida-ballot"> digital images of every paper ballot</a> to recount votes. These images are created when ballots are scanned and are the first step in counting votes. The Florida Division of Elections has begun drafting rules for ballot-image recounts.  According to Stephen Rosenfeld, writing for The Fulcurm, it’s unclear yet when these new rules will be in place but he recently spoke with Rep. Joseph Geller (D-Aventura) about the intent of the law and what it could mean for future recounts in Florida.</p>

The report suggests that nonpartisan observation can: provide an opportunity for the public to learn directly about the election process and give them greater faith that elections are free and fair; check bad-faith actors actively seeking to undermine confidence in U.S. elections through improper actions or baseless assertions about election rigging and malfeasance; and provide important information to those on the front lines of elections as they strive to continuously improve their election processes.</p>

Here&#8217;s an excerpt: <em>The corporate world &#8211; and tech in general &#8211; can move a lot faster than governments or civil society can in building, implementing, scaling and iterating on many of these solutions. We need to be encouraging more companies, not less, to work on building potential solutions as well as working with researchers to study the effects of them. This will require finding ways to share data that is privacy safe. Some efforts &#8211; such as differential privacy &#8211; are being developed, but there is still work to be done. Moreover, companies need to be doing more to help where they can in getting people the right information they need in order to be a part of the political process from registering to vote to knowing where their polling place is, what documentation they need to bring and what their rights are. I’m proud of the work Facebook and other tech companies have done in this space and just like government, the private sector and civil society came together after 2016 to combat foreign interference and frankly like we are seeing today regarding what is happening in Ukraine, we need to do the same to determine how to handle domestic actors who want to disrupt democracy.</em> You can read Katie&#8217;s full speech and view the slides from her presentation<a href="https://elink.clickdimensions.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"> here</a>.</p>

Debby Wood, R-Valley, passed 73 to 28 along party lines.  However, Democrats were able to impact the bill, as Rep. Jeremy Gray, D-Opelika, brought forward an amendment downgrading the criminal charges from a Class C felony to a Class A misdemeanor.  Wood said the bill is designed to prevent voter fraud and keep elections secure. The bill specifically allows applications and registrations to be pre-filled with the voter’s consent. Wood said this bill is only to stop people and groups from filling out forms unsolicited and sending them out.  Democrats have expressed concerns that the bill could result in the criminalization of individuals who are just helping a family member or friend in the voting process. The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3748" src="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-300x200.jpg 300w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap-768x512.jpg 768w, https://electionline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/AZCap.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Arizona:</strong>  The Senate Government Committee has approved<a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2R/proposed/S.2289TOWNSEND.pdf"> House Bill 2289</a>. Under House Bill 2289, voters could<a href="https://www.azpm.org/p/headlines/2022/3/21/208128-arizona-senate-committee-approves-bill-to-scrap-early-voting/"> only cast a ballot in person on Election Day at the polling place in their precinct</a>. Absentee voting would be limited to voters who are going to be outside the state on Election Day, are in a hospital or nursing home, have blindness or are in the armed forces. Currently about 88 percent of Arizona voters cast their ballots early or by mail. &#8220;Just because it is convenient to vote by mail doesn&#8217;t mean that is our right,&#8221; Sen. Wend Rogers (R) told the committee. Opponents, like Democratic Senator Martín Quezada, argued the bill would disenfranchise many voters across the political spectrum. &#8220;Requiring people to show up to vote harms the working class, it harms folks who can&#8217;t afford to take time off from work and not get paid, it harms people who have no reliable transportation, it harms people who have no reliable day care,&#8221; he said. The committee advanced the bill by 4-3 vote along party lines.</p>
<p>The Government Elections Committee passed a bill that would<a href="https://fronterasdesk.org/content/1765841/senate-committee-passes-bill-requiring-ballot-drop-boxes-be-monitored"> require voting drop boxes to be monitored</a>. Ballots cast at drop boxes that are not watched could not be counted by county recorders.  In the absence of a person to monitor the box, the bill would require 24-hour video surveillance. The measure has already passed the House and now goes to the Senate Rules Committee.</p>
<p>Under<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/77849?=Session525"> House Bill 2780</a> every voter who casts a ballot would have their<a href="https://www.azmirror.com/blog/every-voters-name-address-and-ballot-would-be-published-online-after-every-election-under-gop-proposal/"> name and address published online by election officials</a>. The secretary of state would also have to say whether each voter cast their ballot early or in person on Election Day. Under the legislation, county recorders would be required to post a list of the names and addresses of all eligible voters on the county’s website 10 days before primary and general elections. That list would include both active and inactive voters.  When the bill was approved last month by the House of Representatives, county election officials would have also been required to publish the names, addresses and method of voting for every voter who cast a ballot after every election. But Republicans on the Government Committee amended the bill to shift that responsibility to the secretary of state, who would publish that information for all Arizona voters after each election. The bill would also require all ballot images to be published, along with a way to link those ballot images to the post-election publication of voters names. The committee approved the bill on a 4-2 party-line vote. Its next stop is the Senate floor, where it will be considered by the full chamber.</p>

The bill, which would prohibit people from &#8220;openly&#8221; carrying a firearm within 100 feet of a voting center, drop box or counting facility during any election, is meant to further protect Coloradans&#8217; right to vote. &#8220;When we protect Colorado voters from intimidation at the ballot box, we protect democracy,&#8221; said Jena Griswold, Colorado&#8217;s Secretary of State. &#8220;I am proud of this important legislation which will safeguard Colorado voters&#8217; right to cast a ballot without intimidation or interference regardless of their zip code, political affiliation, or race.&#8221; If it is passed into law, infringement upon this firearm prohibition near voting centers could result in a fine of up to $1,000 and up to 364 days in the county jail, or both, according to the bill&#8217;s summary. There are exceptions for first-time offenses.</p>

The bill was approved 30-4 after a 41/2-hour debate. Any amendment accepted by the Senate would have sent the legislation back to the House, which passed the bill in a bipartisan 126-16 vote last week. Sen. Rob Sampson (R-Wolcott) made eight attempts to rewrite the bill but all attempts at an amendment failed. The new law would allow voters to apply for absentee ballots even if they were worried about possible sickness or physical disability of others, rather than their individual sickness. Under the bill, qualified voters could also cast mail-in ballots because of their absence from their city or town during part of election days.</p>

The committee moved the bill&#8217;s effective date to Jan. 1, 2023, in time for the 2024 elections. The guide would consist of 150-word statements from candidates running for statewide or federal offices. The candidate statements would be translated into languages covered by the Voting Rights Act, according to written testimony from Scott Nago, the state&#8217;s chief election officer. The committee agreed to add a Hawaiian translation.  The legislation allows the state elections office to distribute the guide by &#8220;whatever means is practical.&#8221; Publishing the guide, translating it and mailing it to voters would cost more than $2.5 million for both the primary and general election, according to Nago&#8217;s testimony. The cost for publishing the guide online would be more than $119,000 for both elections.  The committee removed the references to appropriations from the bill since its effective date would not be until 2023.</p>

Lodge said she received thousands of emails opposed to the legislation, “especially from people with disabilities, elderly people, and people with children who couldn’t wait in line.” Lodge, who is retiring this year after serving 11 terms, declined to specifically say the bill won&#8217;t get a hearing, but twice said, “I think it’s obvious what’s going to happen with the bill,” when pressed for a definitive answer. Backers of the bill said drop boxes are susceptible to theft and arson. Opponents said drop boxes are especially useful in rural areas, and the measure could eliminate the U.S. Post Office as a place to drop off ballots.</p>

The affidavit mandate would supplement existing law guiding transporting, preserving and destroying ballots and election records. A person allegedly providing false information to hinder, prevent or defeat a fair election could be subject to arrest and a sentence ranging from probation to months in jail. Sen. Richard Hilderbrand, who sponsored the bill, said, “There is still the human-error element in everything we do. Any time we can secure and insure fair elections, that every vote legally cast is counted, we owe it to our constituents.” Sen. Ethan Corson (D-Fairway) noted that the bill was not championed by any state or local elections officials. “We are, I think, improperly inserting ourselves into a really complicated system,” Corson said. “We have secure elections. There is not a problem.”</p>
<p>Following several hours of debate, the Senate has voted to <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article259713555.html">limit the use of early voting ballot drop boxes</a> and shorten the amount of time mail-in ballots have to arrive after Election Day. The chamber voted 22 to 17 to approve a bill limiting counties to one ballot drop box per 30,000 people, requiring monitoring of boxes when open and eliminating a 3-day post-election grace period for mail-in ballots to arrive. The measure, which fell five votes short of a veto-proof majority, now heads to the House where lawmakers voted down a similar bill eliminating the grace period in committee. Johnson and Wyandotte Counties would retain their current number of drop boxes under the bill, but they would need to operate only during business hours rather than be open for drop offs around the clock. Furthermore, those boxes, which are placed around the county, would need an election worker manning them at all times.</p>

Rep. Seth Berry, D-Bowdoinham, said that currently, only a relatively small number of cities and larger towns have charters that govern election rules, which would allow them to adopt ranked-choice voting. His bill would expand that right to the 413 Maine municipalities that do not have official charters and are instead governed by state law, which requires them to decide elections through a plurality vote. Berry, the bill&#8217;s sponsor, said passage of the bill would not force any of the state&#8217;s 488 municipalities to adopt ranked-choice voting. He framed the issue as a matter of local control for the vast majority of towns that do not have formal charters. The bill passed in the House on Tuesday by a vote of 75 to 61, with Republicans opposed. It now heads to the Senate.</p>

Ten Republican lawmakers sent a letter to Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen, requesting that she ask legislators whether they support or oppose a special session on May 2. The lawmakers want to propose a “Select Special Interim Joint House and Senate Committee of Election Security,” to investigate the state’s election procedures. In their letter, they pointed to “the continuing and widespread belief, among a significant majority of Montana voters, that sufficient irregularities in election security in Montana create serious doubt as to the integrity of elections in our State.” The lawmakers said the committee should have subpoena powers and come with funding for legal staff and frequent meetings. They said a special session should be held in May because the Legislature needs “as much time as possible to determine the integrity of the election system” before the June 7 primary.</p>

Legal analyses of Herman’s resolution conducted by Washoe County district attorney’s office staff and Legislative Counsel Bureau staff found several proposed changes — such as ensuring voter registrations expire every five years and ensuring there are “bipartisan teams” approved by the central committees of primary political parties that would oversee various portions of the electoral process, including manning ballot boxes and verifying signatures — would require changes to state law enacted by the Legislature. According to The Nevada Independent, the decision came after about six hours of heated public comment on the election resolution, featuring supporters who claimed the 2020 election was fraudulent and said the changes would improve election security, and opponents who argued the resolution represented a form of voter suppression that would make it more difficult to engage in the county’s elections and who pointed to the high costs of the proposal.</p>

The jail would be required to provide a voter registration application to a person in custody who requests an application and who is determined to be eligible to vote. The jail would be required to make available current resource materials, maintained by the county election commission and secretary of state, containing detailed information regarding the voting rights of a person with a criminal conviction in print. This would require money from the county to pay poll workers and for equipment. Costs estimates according to the bill&#8217;s fiscal note is about $110,000 over the two years.

Griffen issued a permanent injunction against the new voting laws at the end of a four-day trial in a challenge brought by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas, Arkansas United and five voters over the restrictions. The measures struck down include a change to the state’s voter ID law that removes the option for someone to sign an affidavit affirming their identity if they don’t present a photo identification at the polls. The other measures would prevent anyone other than voters from being within 100 feet of a polling place, require an absentee voter’s signature on a ballot to match the signature on their voter registration application, and move up the deadline for voters to return absentee ballots in person. Griffen, who ruled from the bench, said he planned to issue a more detailed order later.

After months of recounts and court hearings, Belford ruled against most of incumbent Bob Grogan’s requests and declared the final margin of victory in White’s favor was 66 votes, up by eight votes over the full recount tally. White, a Democrat, originally led by 75 votes in fall 2020. The court-ordered full recount of the race in October — a first in DuPage County history — that reduced his margin of victory to 58 votes, 232,710 votes for White and 232,652 for Grogan, a Republican seeking reelection. Belford ordered 10 ballot envelopes that had Xs as initials to be struck from the final vote total, nine from Grogan’s count and one from White. Belford said while an X can be counted as a signature, an X cannot count as an initial. Grogan’s request that 40 disputed ballots be removed from the count was rejected by Belford, arguing Grogan was attempting to shift the burden of finding evidence back to the county. Grogan had not demonstrated “clear and convincing” evidence.</p>

The motion, filed by State Senator Vernon Sykes and Ohio House Minority Leader Allison Russo, seeks to move the primary election to June 28, nearly two months from its currently scheduled May 3 date. The motion looks to “ensure that this Court can continue working with the<a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/ohio-redistricting-commission-hires-outside-mapmakers/"> Commission</a> to make progress on adopting and implementing a plan that satisfies both state and federal constitutional requirements.” While June 28 is highlighted as the date to move the primary, the motion states that any other date works as well that would “allow sufficient time for the Commission to adopt and implement a new, constitutional set of maps.” In addition, the motion states that moving the date would allow the commission to complete its duty without the interruption of federal litigation, particularly a lawsuit filed by Ohio republicans asking the court to institute the second set of maps the commission approved. That suit is set for a conference this Friday.</p>

The Democratic-majority state Supreme Court ruled 5-2, along party lines, to overturn a January decision by a Republican judge on the lower Commonwealth Court. That judge ruled that Dominion could not intervene in a wider case involving an inspection of its equipment used by heavily Republican Fulton County in 2020’s election. The decision revives Dominion’s request that any inspection of its equipment be conducted by a federally accredited voting system test lab or a national laboratory used by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.</p>

Spencer Cox, a Republican, declined to comment directly on the lawsuit but said he supports the maps he signed. Asked during his monthly news conference on PBS Utah, he said he clarified that he believes the maps were not “illegal gerrymandering.” The case filed in state court also was backed by Better Boundaries, the group that sponsored the ballot initiative that created the commission. The commission members worked or three years to draw nonpartisan maps for congressional districts as well as state Legislature and school board.</p>

That ends a<a href="https://www.wcax.com/2022/03/21/judge-affirms-winner-close-burlington-city-council-race/"> legal fight over the narrow victory</a>. The balance of power on the City Council will remain the same after a challenge from Democrat Aleczander Stith against independent incumbent Ali Dieng for the Ward 7 seat. Stith lost on Election Day by just two votes. A recount affirmed that margin. But Stith took the case to court over four mail-in ballots which were never counted because they were either not signed properly or mailed incorrectly. Stith questioned whether election officials had taken all of the proper steps to notify the owners of the ballots so that they might have been counted. The judge ruled election officials did all that was necessary by law to contact the ballot owners via voter registration records which mostly just have an address and phone number.</p>

Novak of the U.S. Eastern District Court of Virginia accused former Attorney General Mark Herring’s office of mishandling a closely watched lawsuit seeking to force<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/21/setting-new-timetable-in-virginia-election-lawsuit-judge-rips-state-for-legal-mess/"> new House of Delegates elections</a> this year, saying the state didn’t take Democratic activist Paul Goldman’s claims seriously enough last year and has forced arcane legal wrangling to go on for “way too long.” “This case has been a mess from your predecessors,” Judge David J. Novak of the U.S. Eastern District Court of Virginia told attorneys working on behalf of new Attorney General Jason Miyares. “It was totally handled wrong.” Herring’s office sought to have the lawsuit dismissed on largely technical grounds. But Novak said Monday the state failed to adequately respond to Goldman’s legal arguments and threw the case into procedural confusion. Acknowledging he was “venting” from the bench, the judge said Goldman, while at times taking “artful” detours into unrelated matters, is making a substantive argument. Novak gave the two sides until mid-April to file new briefs addressing the standing issue, including whether it should be heard by Novak alone or a three-judge panel also involved in the case.</p>
<p>In June 2021, radio talk show host Rob Schilling filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia that his<a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/schilling-voting-rights-lawsuits-survives-dismissal-attempt/article_788e4754-aa10-11ec-bc18-df638f22e8cd.html"> rights were violated when he was briefly prevented from voting</a> during the June 8 primary in Albemarle County due to a face mask dispute. Albemarle County Registrar Jake Washburne was initially named as a defendant alongside Election Officer Leo Mallek and two then-unnamed poll workers, but Washburne was later dropped. According to the lawsuit, Schilling was able to cast his ballot after a poll worker not named in the lawsuit placed a call to Washburne. The whole altercation is alleged to have lasted six minutes. Schilling claims his right to vote was violated, that he was the subject of voter intimidation and that he was the victim of assault, battery and false imprisonment at the hands of the two unnamed poll workers. In July 2021 lawyers for Mallek filed a motion to dismiss. Last week, U.S. District Judge Norman K. Moon issued a memorandum opinion, largely denying Mallek’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit. Mallek argued that even should Schilling’s allegations prove true, Mallek did not commit a federal rights violation or a tort. Moon did grant a dismissal of Schilling’s putative Voting Rights Act claim because the provision Schilling invokes does not create a private cause of action, meaning Schilling as an individual is without the legal right to raise the issue on his own behalf.</p>

The attorneys pushing to strengthen Latinos’ voices in commissioner elections were hoping for a trial before April 22 — the one-year anniversary of when the case was filed. Judge Jackie Shea Brown sided with Franklin County’s attorneys and pushed the hearing into the middle of May. Three local members of the League of United Latin American Citizens are suing Franklin County under the Washington State Voting Rights Act. The suit claims the commissioner’s district boundaries and at-large elections dilute Latino votes. The Washington State Voting Rights Act requires any trial on an alleged violation must be held a year after “a complaint” is filed.</p>

The result has been further polar­iz­a­tion of our already divided coun­try. There has been a bois­ter­ous debate about the de-plat­form­ing of former pres­id­ent Donald Trump, but how else are social media compan­ies able to combat those delib­er­ately spread­ing false inform­a­tion? How do we control this false speech while protect­ing the First Amend­ment — and our demo­cracy? Join us for a live discus­sion with one of the coun­try’s lead­ing experts on elec­tion law, Richard L. Hasen, author of the upcom­ing book <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300259377/cheap-speech">Cheap Speech: How Disin­form­a­tion Pois­ons Our Polit­ics — and How to Cure It</a>, for a look into how social media compan­ies can solve this prob­lem without shut­ting down the essen­tial free flow of ideas and opin­ions.

Most election systems are designed to be led by nonpartisan experts with the best interests of all voters in mind. But today, these systems and experts must contend with growing partisan polarization, political vitriol, and misinformation. Join the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) and the Election Reformer&#8217;s Network (ERN) for a conversation with former swing state election officials about ways to protect election administration from harmful partisan influence. This event accompanies a forthcoming joint report from BPC and ERN documenting how partisan incentives for election officials have changed over time and what the risks are for electoral integrity and trust in elections should political pressure continue to increase. When: April 6, 12pm Eastern. Where: Online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hhh.umn.edu/election-administration/election-accuracy-going-offensive">Election Accuracy: Going on the Offensive</a>: Local and state election officials in the United States — who run the most accurate and secure voting process in the world — are finding that facts are not a sufficient defense of their election outcomes. Despite the rigorous steps that protect voter registration, ballot distribution, election systems and vote counting, conspiracy theories are undermining the public&#8217;s trust in this most basic act of a democracy. To combat this problem, experts from around the nation analyze the problem to provide actionable steps so election administrators can go on the offense to manage communications before, during and after an election.
