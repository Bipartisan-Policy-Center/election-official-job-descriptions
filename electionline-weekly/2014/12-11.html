							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>First Person Singular: Nevada Secretary of State Ross Miller<br /></strong><em>Nevada’s youngest secretary of state looks to the future</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p>In 2012, outgoing Nevada Secretary of State Ross Miller made headlines nationwide, but it wasn’t because of a botched election or some sort of political scandal.</p>
<p>It was something way cooler…</p>
<p>In his first sanctioned mixed martial arts fight at the World Championship of Fighting he won his bout in a second round knockout.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" style="border: 1px solid #000000; float: left;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/RossMiller2_copy.jpg" alt="RossMiller2 copy" width="250" height="243" />Now that he&#8217;s knocked out his two terms of service as secretary of state, Miller, who when sworn-in in January 2007, became the youngest secretary of state in Nevada’s history, is on to his next adventure.</p>
<p>Before he was secretary of state, Miller served as a deputy district attorney in Clark County. He has a law degree and MBA from Loyola Marymount University and a Bachelor’s from Stanford.</p>
<p>As Nevada’s secretary of state, Miller created the multi-jurisdictional Elections Integrity Task Force that has been identified as a national model by the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI.</p>
<p>Miller served as the president of the National Association of Secretaries of State and in 2013 <em>Governing</em> magazine named him as one of the top state officials to watch.</p>
<p>And in addition to that whole MMA thing, Miller is apparently also a baller. While attending the Monterrey Technical Institute in Monterrey, Mexico, he played on a basketball team that won the Collegiate Mexican National Basketball championship.</p>
<p><strong><em>Obviously you are term-limited and could not seek re-election as secretary of state, how do you feel about your time in office coming to an end? <br /></em></strong>It’s never easy to leave a job that you find rewarding.&nbsp;My two terms as Nevada secretary of state have resulted in accomplishments that could have come only with public help and supports, so I finish those two terms knowing that together Nevadans and I have made the Silver State a better place. I take great pride in performing my duties in a bipartisan manner and expanding the scope of services available. I first campaigned for secretary of state with the promises of greater transparency and accessibility, and for nearly eight years I have led my staff with those promises in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>What would you say has been the biggest change you have seen in elections during your tenure?<br /></em></strong>Without a doubt, the biggest change during my eight years as secretary of state is the advances in technology that my office has implemented across various platforms to make information and voter registration more accessible to Nevadans. My office became the sole filing officer for contribution &amp; expense reports and financial disclosure statements in 2012, so we created a new database to make it easier to both file and view information. We implemented online voter registration in Nevada’s largest county in 2010 and expanded it statewide within two years. And Nevada became the first state in the nation to provide an electronic balloting system for its military and overseas citizens.</p>
<p><strong><em>What was the most difficult time/issue you have faced (elections wise of course) as secretary?<br /></em></strong>When I first took office in 2008, I not only faced a steep learning curve as secretary of state, but Nevada had also instituted term limits the same year, making my role even more challenging. Multiple lawsuits had been filed in different counties, and it was my job to sort through it all and make clear, firm rulings.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do feel was your greatest accomplishment and why?<br /></em></strong>I am proud of so many things that this office has accomplished that it’s tough to narrow it down to one. I’m proud of expanding early voting; creating the multi-jurisidictional Election Integrity Task Force, which the U.S. Department of Justice named a best-practices model for maintaining the integrity and security of the elections process; building an election night results reporting website that is efficient and easy to use; implementing electronic balloting for Nevada’s military and overseas voters; and having the biggest increase in voter turnout in the nation from the 2008 to 2012 elections. The PEW Charitable Trusts even ranked Nevada fifth nationally for our 2012 election performance, jumping from 22<sup>nd</sup> in 2008.</p>
<p>However, I would have to say that my greatest accomplishment is implementing online voter registration statewide. It makes it so easy, fast, and accessible for all Nevadans to register to vote or update their registration information. They no longer have to make a special trip to their county clerk’s office or mail in an application. With the increasing accessibility of the internet, they can simply use a computer or any smart device to get the job done in a mere five minutes. When online voter registration expanded statewide in 2012, more than 41,000 Nevadans registered to vote online between the primary election and general election deadlines. At the close of registration for the 2012 general election, Nevada had a record number of active registered voters at more than 1.25 million.</p>
<p><strong><em>Is there anything you still hope to accomplish as secretary before leaving office?<br /></em></strong>With the little time I have left in office, I want to ensure that ongoing projects and issues are being handled in a way where I can be proud to leave a good legacy for my successor and ease her transition into this office.</p>
<p><strong><em>What will you miss most about being secretary of state?<br /></em></strong>I will miss the ability to exact change on a wide, sweeping scale and be in charge of delivering public services so important to Nevadans.</p>
<p><strong><em>As an expert in the field of elections, where do you see the administration of elections headed?<br /></em></strong>I see many states that are embracing advances in technology and incorporating changes in their elections administration. Seeing what a difference technology has made in Nevada’s elections leads me to believe that elections will become more accessible and inclusive to eligible voters.</p>
<p><strong><em>What’s next for you, besides being able to sleep in on election days? Any more MMA fights?! <br /></em></strong>In considering what I leave behind as my two terms come to a close, I can’t overlook the fact that any legacy is a shared one.&nbsp;My legacy has been made possible by the voters of Nevada, and by the relationship we forged while I’ve been in office. I will always value that shared experienced. While I do not, at this point, know specifically what the future holds, I am fairly certain that there will always be a component of public service in my life. It is a commitment that runs deeply in my family.</p>
<p>As for MMA, I said I was one and done, but since it is still a great passion of mine, I can’t make any promises that you won’t see me in a bout or two in the future.</p>
<p><strong><em>Any parting words of advice for your successor?<br /></em></strong>Never forget who you’re here to serve. You’ll always come under fire from detractors, but follow your instincts and make choices that will benefit all Nevadans.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Editor’s Note:</span></strong> Electionline reached out to all outgoing secretaries of state for an exit interview. Some declined our offer and we never heard from a few others (there’s still time so fingers crossed). Read our other exit interviews with Colorado Secretary of State <strong><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2014/1386-electionlineweekly-september-18-2014">Scott Gessler</a></strong>, Idaho Secretary of State <strong><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2014/1340-electionlineweekly-july-24-2014">Ben Ysursa</a></strong>, Minnesota Secretary of State <strong><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2014/1357-electionlineweekly-august-14-2014">Mark Ritchie</a></strong> and Wyoming Secretary of State <strong><a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2014/1363-electionlineweekly-august-21-2014">Max Maxfield</a></strong>.</p>

<li>The <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2014/12/09/official-some-ballots-likely-counted-twice-in-maine-senate-district-25/">mystery of the 21 ballots in a Maine Senate race has been solved</a> and it turns out that they weren’t so mysterious after all, they were simply counted twice, by mistake. Deputy Secretary of State Julie Flynn said it was likely that the 21 ballots mistakenly had been put into another bundle of ballot after having already been counted in the first bundle. “I believe (the error) happened in the recount, and I’m chagrined to say so,” Flynn said during five hours of testimony before a specially appointed task force reviewing the recount. “I’d eat my hat if I had one.”
</li>
<li>Residents of the town of Hobbs, New Mexico went to the polls this week and voted to require residents to <a href="http://krqe.com/2014/12/09/hobbs-residents-set-to-decide-on-voter-id/">show photo ID in order to vote in future elections</a>. According to <em>The Associated Press</em>, about 78 percent of those casting ballots in the special election voted to amend the city’s charter. Several other cities and towns in New Mexico — including Albuquerque — already require voters to show photo ID in local elections.
</li>
<li>The Montana political practices commissioner <a href="http://ravallirepublic.com/missoula/news/state-and-regional/article_630fb6bf-a580-5cdd-9d97-4b9e2906736d.html">dismissed a complaint that Secretary of State Linda McCulloch improperly used public resources</a> to solicit opposition to a ballot issue. According to the <em>Ravalli Republic</em>, Commissioner Jonathan Motl found insufficient evidence to justify a civil or criminal prosecution. The complaint was brought by Senate President Jeff Essman (R-Billings) argued that McCulloch used her summer newsletter to improperly advocate against Referendum 126 that would have repealed the state’s election-day registration law. Voters rejected the referendum 57 percent to 43 percent.
</li>
<li>With people demonstrating against police brutality nationwide, returning citizens and faith leaders staged a silent sit-in this week at the Florida State Capitol in support of voting rights for ex-offenders. The protestors want a constitutional amendment on the 2016 ballot that would automatically <a href="http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Protesters-Hold-Silent-Sit-In-for-Felon-Voting-Rights-Restoration-285424641.html">restore the voting rights of ex-offenders</a> once their sentences are complete.
</li>
<li>Elections that <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-2014-elections-that-ended-in-a-tie/">end in ties</a> are more common than what most people think. However, what’s probably not as common are <a href="http://wamu.org/news/14/12/09/dc_race_ends_in_tie_setting_up_high_noon_casting_of_lots">two races ending in ties with the exact same vote count</a>! That’s what happened this week following recounts of two Advisory Neighborhood Commission races in Washington, D.C. Following manual recounts of each race, both were tied with 204 votes for each candidate. The D.C. Board of Elections will conduct a tiebreaker (names out of a hat) for both races next week.

<li>One hundred and forty five years ago this week Wyoming became the <a href="http://www.kotatv.com/news/nebraska-news/Wyoming-celebrates-145-years-of-women-voting/30165402">first state to give women the right to vote</a>. According to KOTA when the law took effect there were only about 6,000 men and 1,000 women in Wyoming. Today, a little over half of the registered voters in Wyoming are women.

<li>A lot goes into the <a href="http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/timing-could-put-fargo-mayoral-election-during-flood-season/article_f7c1547a-7bf2-11e4-b552-e31bbf996b4f.html">planning and timing of special elections</a> and that is no different for Fargo, North Dakota which is facing a springtime special election to replace it’s long term mayor who died unexpectedly last week. The earliest the city can legally hold the election is mid-March, but logistically they may need to move it to April that would put the election right in the middle of flood season in the city nestled on the banks of the flood-prone Red River.

<p><strong>Alaska: </strong>U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason is urging the state and a groups of Alaska Native plaintiffs to see if they can <a href="http://www.adn.com/article/20141210/judge-asks-plaintiffs-state-consider-settlement-alaska-native-voting-rights-case">reach a settlement</a> over the plaintiffs voting rights lawsuit.According to <em>The Associated Press</em>, Gleason is reviewing a plan the state submitted—per her ruling—and is asking the parties to come to terms. New Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott told the news service that his desire is to settle the case.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia: </strong>A voter in Douglas County as filed suit against the county and county elections officials <a href="http://jacksonville.com/breaking-news/2014-12-09/story/douglas-county-man-sues-county-elections-officials-over-being-asked">claiming his civil rights were violated when he was asked to remove his NRA</a> hat before entering a polling place to vote. According to The Associated Press, the lawsuit challenges what it calls a per se ban on clothing referencing the NRA at county polling places.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana</strong>: Attorneys for former Secretary of State <a href="http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20141210/LOCAL06/312099912">Charlie White argued their appeal</a> before three judges of the Indiana Court of Appeals. The attorneys presented three arguments: ineffective assistance of counsel; insufficient evidence; and the jury and judge not properly applying the law. According to the Journal Gazette, a decision is expected in the next few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky: </strong>A <a href="http://www.wkyt.com/wymt/home/headlines/Lawsuit-filed-in-connection-with-election-for-Magoffin-County-Judge-Executive--284951851.html">civil suit</a> has been filed in the recent judge executive race in Magoffin County. The suit claims that absentee ballots may have been improperly cast and that ineligible voters may have also cast ballots.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: A judge in Hackensack ordered that the voting machines and all other materials related to the November 4 mayoral election in Bogota be preserved and presented to the state’s attorney general who is investigating reports that <a href="http://cliffviewpilot.com/bogota-poll-workers-accused-of-casting-residents-votes-investigation-under-way/">poll workers cast ballots</a> on behalf of some elderly and Spanish-speaking voters.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: On Wednesday, the New Mexico Supreme Court <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/508322/news/new-mexico-court-clears-way-for-recount.html">lifted a stay it had imposed on the recount</a> in the race for land commissioner.

<p><strong>Oregon</strong>: Sponsors of Measure 92 — currently undergoing a statewide recount — filed an emergency lawsuit this week challenging the method used by elections officials to make sure signatures on <a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Oregon-GMO-label-backers-sue-over-rejected-votes--285167091.html">ballot measure envelopes are not forged</a>. According to <em>The Associated Press</em>, the suit seeks to force officials to count 4,600 ballots disqualified because signatures on the vote-by-mail envelopes didn’t match those on registration cards. Multnomah County Judge Henry Kantor <a href="http://www.kgw.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/09/gmo-labeling-loses-court-fight-to-count-rejected-ballots/20169377/">denied the reques</a>t saying that he did not find the state’s rules on matching ballot signatures to unreasonable or illegal.</p>

<p><strong>California: </strong>The Sacramento City Council is considering a proposal to allow the city to use only <a href="http://www.capradio.org/articles/2014/12/08/sacramento-hopes-to-try-vote-by-mail-only-election/">vote-by-mail</a> in an upcoming special election for a member of the council. Currently about 56 percent of the voters registered in the affected district are signed up as permanent vote-by-mail voters.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri: </strong>State Sen. Will Kraus (an announced candidate for secretary of state in 2016) has filed legislation that would set an <a href="http://www.kmbc.com/news/mo-bill-would-set-deadline-for-ballot-proposals/30104624">eight-week deadline to make changes to ballot initiatives or referendum</a>. Current law allows changes to be made at any point within 180 days of an election. Proponents of the legislation — which includes many county clerks — argue that the move would save money.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio: </strong>The Ohio House has approved a <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/12/redistricting_reform_passes_oh.html">bipartisan plan to change how the state draws legislative districts</a>. Under the current system, a five-member board draws the new boundaries every 10 years. Under the new plan, two members would be added and four votes, including at least two from minority party members of the board would be required to approve a new map. The vote was 80-4.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: Legislation that was pre-filed last week would include concealed weapon permits to count as one of the <a href="http://www.thestate.com/2014/12/06/3857675_the-buzz-concealed-weapon-permits.html?rh=1">approved forms of ID</a> for South Carolina voters to cast a ballot.</p>
