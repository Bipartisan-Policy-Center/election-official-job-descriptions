														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Law &amp; Order: Elections division<br /></strong><em>A snapshot of the plethora of elections-related litigation</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti</p>
<p>These days, how, when and where people cast a ballot is determined as much by the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/08/25/342525138/on-the-fall-docket-who-gets-to-vote-and-who-gets-to-decide">legal system</a> as it by legislators.</p>
<p><em>Electionline</em> doesn’t purport to be Rick Hasen’s <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/">Election Law Blog</a> or an elections law expert like the folks at the <a href="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/">Moritz College of Law</a> at The Ohio State University, shoot, <em>electionline</em> doesn’t even have a law degree (although we wonder whether maybe we should), but one thing we can do is read and summarize the news.</p>
<p>And so here is a snapshot of some of the litigation that is currently pending — or has recently been decided — throughout the country.</p>
<p>Obviously in these litigious times there is a lot more out there that we didn’t include, but this should give you an idea of the current legal landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Alaska</strong>: A decision is still pending on voting rights trial in Alaska that pitted Alaska Native organizations against the state over the <a href="http://www.adn.com/article/20140702/voting-rights-trial-alaska-elections-chief-contends-village-voter-turnout-above">translation of ballots</a>. According to the Alaska News Dispatch, plaintiffs claim the states failure to provide language help, as required by the U.S. Voting Rights Act, suppresses turnout. They want the judge to force the state to translate a <a href="http://www.ktoo.org/2014/08/21/yupik-voters-give-alaska-ballot-translation-mixed-reviews/">variety of elections materials</a> including ballots into Gwich’in and all the Yup’ik dialects.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: U.S. District Judge David Campbell halted this week’s election for a seat on the Peoria city council. Ballots for the election were <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/peoria/2014/08/22/federal-judge-peoria-ballot-issue-abrk/14463409/">misprinted two times</a>. While the third printing included the missing candidate’s name, the city council voted to only count the first two misprinted ballots. Campbell ruled that instead of an election this week that a special election should be held.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas</strong>: Litigation is still pending in The Natural State over the state’s proposed voter ID law. In May a circuit judge granted a preliminary injunction against the state’s <a href="http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/aclu-others-argue-voter-id-law-unconstitutional">voter ID law</a>, but the judge stayed his order pending an expected appeal so the law was in place for the May primary and June runoff. This month college professors, activist groups and one county clerk sought permission to file friend-of-the-court briefs in support of the plaintiffs who sued to stop the law.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong>: A former candidate is suing the Fullerton City council who claims that the city’s <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/city-631636-fullerton-council.html">at-large voting system</a> violates the California Voting Rights Act of 2001. According to the O.C. Register, the suit alleges that Fullerton’s system “impairs the ability of certain races to election candidates of their choice or influence the outcome of elections…”</p>
<p><strong>Colorado</strong>: The small town of Castle Rock recently held a special election on whether or not residents will be allowed to open-carry guns, but the results are still not known due to pending litigation. The latest lawsuit—there have been several—contends that there are <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26403062/castle-rock-open-carry-special-election-draws-another">problems with the way the mail-in ballots are being processed</a> and that the election should be rendered void.</p>
<p>Also in Colorado, the Town of Montezuma <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26325550/town-montezuma-sues-all-its-voters-over-flawed">filed suit against every registered voter</a> in the town arguing that the 2013 spring election had numerous errors due to the voters themselves. According to <em>The Denver Post</em>, the suit lists errors that include numbers that don’t add up and mismatched ballots that had to be patched together on the clerk’s sewing machine.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: Late last week Leon County Circuit Judge Terry Lewis <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/judge-approves-new-fla-house-map-110275.html">approved new congressional voting maps</a>. In July Lewis had ruled the maps unconstitutional and the Florida legislature had to call a special session to redraw the maps. An attorney for a coalition of groups that had originally sued over the district lines told <em>Politico</em> that the groups plan to appeal the ruling.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii</strong>: In addition to a legislative investigation into the August 9 primary in the Aloha State, the American Civil Liberties Union has filed a <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20140821_Hawaii_ACLU_files_legal_challenge_to_primary_election.html?id=272246391">legal challenge to the election</a>. According to the <em>Honolulu Star-Advertiser</em> the lawsuit asks the court to give any voter affected by Tropical Storm Iselle a chance to vote in person or by absentee before September 20. The 20th is the deadline for tabulating primary results. This week the state asked the Hawaii Supreme Court to <a href="http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/20140825_State_asks_Supreme_Court_to_dismiss_election_challenge.html?id=272675121">dismiss the legal challenge</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa</strong>: An attorney representing five people who <a href="http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/defense-challenges-statute-in-voter-fraud-case/article_fe32a069-0c99-560a-95b6-6407e0dbe230.html">allegedly voted despite having felony convictions</a> is asking the court to throw out the cases. Public Defender Aaron Hawbaker argued that the state statute banning felons from voting is improper because it oversteps the state constitutions that only bars people convicted of an “infamous crime” from voting. The judge in the case gave Hawbaker two weeks to submit briefs.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas (and Arizona)</strong>: This week the U.S. Department of Justice argued against Kansas’ <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article1288309.html">proof-of-citizenship law</a>. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver heard the arguments. The three-judge panel failed to make a decision instead <a href="http://ksn.com/2014/08/25/denver-court-considers-kansas-arizona-voter-rules/">suggesting that the U.S. Election Assistance Commission did not have the power</a> or authority to reject the states’ request because staff members and not commissioners made the decision. The court indicated that they would not have a decision before the November election.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong>: The National Federation of the Blind filed suit against the state of Maryland demanding that the state certify <a href="http://www.wbaltv.com/news/judge-rules-case-on-blind-ballot-tool-will-go-forward/27506330#!bKxT9A">online ballot-marking devices</a> to help facilitate voting for those with disabilities. The plaintiffs, that contend that blind voters are denied their voting rights by relying on someone to help them fill out their ballot rested their case on Aug. 15. This week the state presented three days of testimony arguing why officials should not be forced to certify the equipment. At the <a href="http://www.greenfieldreporter.com/view/story/b2822f633a914977ba8259b4368c0584/MD--Ballots-for-the-Blind">conclusion of testimony</a>, U.S. District Judge Richard Bennett said that he should have a ruling by the end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan</strong>: Dearborn Heights resident Robert Hadous has filed suit seeking to compel the city council to explain why it is not in <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140814/METRO01/308140041/Judge-asked-compel-Dearborn-Heights-council-defend-failure-replace-city-clerk">contempt of court for failing to replace the town’s clerk</a> who resigned, but then rescinded that resignation.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi</strong>: A date of Sept. 16 has been set to hear arguments in the lawsuit filed by state Sen. Chris McDaniel who is <a href="http://www.cdispatch.com/news/article.asp?aid=35767">challenging the June 24 Republican primary runoff</a> that he lost to U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran. In the most recent action in the case, Cochran’s attorney argued in filings that the date of the hearing is too late and that therefore the suit should be dismissed. The judge will hear pretrial motions, including the motion to dismiss, on August 28. All of this could be for naught though because Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann has <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/politicalledger/2014/08/26/cochran-ballot-mcdaniel-election/14628563/">set the November ballot</a> — including Cochran — and said that early voting will begin in September.</p>
<p>At press time, in the latest twist to this case McDaniel <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/dailyledes/2014/08/27/mcdaniel-subpoena-voting-records/14693103/">subpoenaed all the voting records from 46 counties</a>. According to The Clarion-Ledger, clerks have two days to deliver “original election documentation.” Needless to say, the clerks are none-too-pleased about this. At least one county — Oktibbeha — has filed a motion to quash.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada</strong>: According to the <em>Las Vegas Review-Journal</em>, an immigrant living in the country illegally who registered to vote in Washoe County under a false name and cast ballots in the 2008 and 2010 Nevada elections has been sentenced to 103 days in jail after pleading guilty to one gross misdemeanor count of <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/illegal-voter-sentenced-reno">“conspiracy to commit violations concerning registration of voters.”</a></p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: A lawsuit filed by <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/450991/news/rr-voting-lawsuit-gets-green-light.html">disgruntled voters in Rio Rancho</a> will proceed after U.S. District Court Judge William Johnson denied the <a href="http://www.kob.com/article/stories/S3543532.shtml?cat=500#.U_38JUjUUT8">plaintiffs request</a> for a summary judgment. The suit, filed against Sandoval County Bureau of Election Director and Eddie Gutierrez and County Clerk Sally Padilla claims that the by offering only five voting locations in Rio Rancho voters were forced to wait in long lines on election day and some failed to cast ballots.</p>
<p>In other litigation news from The Land of Enchantment, a judge recently denied Rep. Mary Helen Garcia’s (D-Las Cruces) <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/450827/news/judge-denies-state-reps-voter-fraud-petition.html">petition to overturn the June primary</a> that she lost by 16 votes. In her petition, Garcia alleged that her los was the result of fraudulent absentee ballots cast in Sunland Park.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The state’s division of the NAACP has <a href="http://www.wfmynews2.com/story/news/local/2014/08/21/appeal-voter-suppression-law/14405349/">appealed</a> U.S. District Judge Thomas D. Schroeder’s <a href="http://www.wfmynews2.com/story/news/local/2014/08/08/new-voting-rules-nc-november-election-proceed-judge-rules/13812291/">ruling</a> that puts new <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/us/judge-in-north-carolina-upholds-2013-voting-law.html?_r=1">voting restrictions</a> into place. The motion comes two weeks after Schroeder denied a preliminary junction against his initial ruling. The <a href="http://www.journalnow.com/news/local/attorneys-for-state-naacp-file-appeal-of-federal-judge-s/article_080e1802-2d44-11e4-9531-0017a43b2370.html">preliminary injunction</a> would have barred the state from limiting early voting days and eliminating same-day voter registration.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio</strong>: U.S. District Judge Peter Economus is weighing arguments over the state’s <a href="http://www.circlevilletoday.com/news_advisories/attorneys-dispute-impact-of-ohio-voting-changes/article_aef9cc27-fd2b-57e5-a3cc-2e56a311d56d.html">early voting law</a>. In the lawsuit, filed by civil rights groups and voting rights organizations, plaintiffs argue that changes to the state’s “golden week” limits voting for black residents. The plaintiffs are seeking a preliminary injunction to keep the law from being enforced in November. According to the <em>Associated Press</em>, the judge’s decision is expected by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Also in Ohio, a second Supreme Court justice has announced that she will not hear the Lucas County GOP’s challenge to Secretary of State Jon Husted’s <a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2014/08/27/2nd-justice-declines-to-hear-complaint.html">refusal to appoint the party’s recommendations</a> to the county BOE.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: The Libertarian party has asked a federal judge to <a href="http://www.mercedsunstar.com/2014/08/27/3815054_sd-libertarians-seek-to-stop-ballot.html?rh=1">halt the printing of ballots</a> for the November general election because their candidate for state public utilities commission does not appear on the ballot. Ryan Gaddy was denied access to the ballot because he changed filed his party affiliation change paperwork too late. Secretary of State Jason Gant told <em>The Associated Press</em> that he has no intention of printing the ballots until the legal issues are resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee</strong>: Former candidate Jessica L. Fallin has filed a complaint in the Chancery Court of Johnson County to <a href="http://www.thetomahawk.com/Detail.php?Cat=HOMEPAGE&amp;ID=60838">overturn the recent election</a> claiming that state election laws were not properly followed with regard to certification and early voting.</p>
<p><strong>Utah</strong>: This week state elections officials argued before the Utah Supreme Court to <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/58335410-90/ballots-clerk-county-court.html.csp">reverse a lower court’s ruling that Millard County hold a new primary runoff</a> election. In the GOP primary, one candidate appeared to win by five votes, but several ballots were challenged and Judge Claudia Laycock ruled that seven ballots were improperly counted and one voter was wrongly denied a vote. Laycock called for a new election, but the state had questions about the order. “It’s become pretty clear to us that we need further direction from the court,&#8221; Mark Thomas, state elections director told <em>The Salt Lake Tribune</em>. &#8220;So essentially the lieutenant governor’s office is going to the Supreme Court on an emergency appeal to get clarification on this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the same election, one of the election challengers has asked a judge to <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/58344652-90/authority-clerk-county-court.html.csp">hold the county clerk in contempt of court</a> for not abiding by the judge’s early order to hold a new primary.</p>
<p><strong>Washington</strong>: A federal judge ordered the city of Yakima to <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024371058_yakimaelectionsxml.html">change its elections system</a> in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act. The court found that Latino voters have not been able to fully participate in city council races.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin</strong>: On Aug. 21 the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals said that it would not rule on Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen’s request to <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/appeals-court-puts-off-request-to-reinstate-voter-id-law-b99335840z1-272221831.html">reinstate the state’s voter ID law</a> while the court is considering the laws overall constitutionality. In a <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walker-jb-van-hollen-again-ask-court-to-reinstate-voter-id-b99335571z1-272501721.html">new court filing</a> Van Hollen and Gov. Scott Walker are once again urging the federal court to reinstate the voter ID law.</p>
<p>And because this section is also about order, a Wisconsin man charged with casting multiple votes in multiple elections including five in the 2012 recall election entered an insanity plea. Robert L. Monroe was charged with <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/shorewood-man-charged-with-illegal-voting-enters-insanity-plea-b99337509z1-272588861.html">13 counts of illegal voting</a>.</p>

							<h2>Primary Roundup</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Primary Roundup</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>: Canceled elections in Peoria aside, primary day in The Copper State was relatively quiet. There were a handful of reports about <a href="http://www.svherald.com/content/sierra-vista-news/2014/08/26/387940">minor problems</a>, but nothing major during the voting process anyway.</p>
<p>The problems in <a href="http://www.willcoxrangenews.com/news/article_3db3308e-2e46-11e4-83a2-0019bb2963f4.html">Cochise County</a> began after the polls closed. Due to a <a href="http://www.svherald.com/content/derek-jordan/2014/08/27/388054">software glitch of some kind</a> — they are still working on it — ballots from Cochise County had to be transported to <a href="http://www.kvoa.com/news/southern-arizona-elections-department-having-problems/">Graham County</a>, which uses the same system, for the ballots to be counted on election night.</p>
<p>Although there are still ballots to count, <a href="http://kjzz.org/content/42847/hundreds-thousands-maricopa-county-residents-vote-early-primary">Maricopa County</a> is guaranteed an almost 20 percent voter turnout because the county received more than 369,000 vote-by-mail ballots in advance of the deadline.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/26367409/tablets-debut-in-county-elections">Pima County</a>, elections officials used tablets for the first time countywide as a way to cut down on provisional ballots, particularly ballots for those who requested an early ballot but then decided to cast their vote on primary day instead.</p>
<p>There are still 1,700 ballots that remain to be counted in <a href="http://www.paysonroundup.com/news/2014/aug/27/1700-uncounted-ballots-could-change-election-outco/">Payson</a> and some of the races are within a 1700 vote margin. It is expected that the votes will be counted by Friday.</p>
<p>Flooding from monsoon rains limited access to one polling place in <a href="http://www.kvoa.com/news/flooding-in-douglas-near-a-polling-location/">Douglas</a>. Voters were directed to approach the polling place from a different direction to avoid flooded streets.</p>
<p>Results from <a href="http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/082714_cochise_vote/flawed-cochise-county-returns-need-recounting-yavapai-delayed/">Yavapai County</a> were not reported until early morning because there were problems with the new vote-tallying system.</p>
<p>Several races in <a href="http://www.svherald.com/content/dana-cole/2014/08/26/387986">Tombstone</a> were close enough that candidates were waiting for provisional ballots to be counted.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2014/08/27/secretary-of-state-arizona-primary-elections/14587377/">secretary of state race</a> State Sen. Michele Reagan won the GOP nod and will take on Democrat Terry Goddard in November. Reagan spent 12 years in the state legislature and most recently served as the chairman of the Senate Elections Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Florida: </strong>Although <a href="http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/22/early-voting-numbers-primaries/14476393/">early voting numbers</a> were down overall in 2014 compared to 2012, they were <a href="http://www.naplesnews.com/news/elections/election-2014-votes-cast-before-election-day-up-more-than-20-percent">up compared to 2010</a>. <a href="http://politics.heraldtribune.com/2014/08/26/record-25k-vote-mail-sarasota-county/">Vote-by-mail</a> seemed to prove increasingly popular in the Sunshine State in the lead-up to the primary election this week. On primary day itself, turnout proved <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/article/20140826/ARTICLES/140829666">lackluster</a>.</p>
<p>A group of registered voters admitted to the Miami-Herald that they would rather <a href="http://miami.cbslocal.com/2014/08/26/fans-camp-out-for-miami-ikeas-grand-opening/">wait in line over night</a> (which they did) for a new IKEA to open up than make their way to the voting booth on Tuesday.</p>
<p>When <a href="http://www.baynews9.com/content/news/baynews9/news/article.html/content/news/articles/bn9/2014/8/27/soe_turns_to_social_.html">Hernando County</a> had issues getting elections results posted to the county website, elections officials did the only thing they could…they turned to social media, Facebook specifically, to post the results while they worked to get the issues with the website resolved.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.wtsp.com/story/news/local/2014/08/24/fire-destroys-pinellas-voting-location-church/14536303/">Pinellas County</a> a fire at the Vietnamese Alliance Church forced the county to find a new polling place just two days before the election. The new polling place, a recreation center, is located about a mile away.</p>
<p>A power outage in <a href="http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2014/08/poll-workers-had-to-verify-voters-id-over-the-phone-during-power-outage-at-plantation-precinct.html">Broward County</a> forced poll workers at one polling place to call the supervisor of elections office to verify voter’s ID when the power was cut to the machines used to swipe driver’s licenses. The machines don’t have battery back-ups. One of the precincts at the polling place saw no voters during the outage and the other saw 10.</p>
<p>Early primary day voters ran into problems in <a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/palm-beach-county-elections-office-chases-dow-ipad/ng9BD/">Palm Beach County</a> with the mini-iPads the county purchased — for $1.3 million — this year to help check-in voters. About 50 voters’ licenses were rejected due to technical problems and those voters were given provisional ballots. Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher said the problem was quickly resolved.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://politics.heraldtribune.com/2014/08/26/cool-solution-voting-problem-manatee/">Manatee County</a>, five temporary air conditioners kept voters and poll workers cool at the Kirby Stewart American Legion polling place. The temporary units were brought in after the supervisor of elections office was informed that the building’s HVAC system was being renovated…during the election.</p>
<p>And it was business as usual at one <a href="http://wlrn.org/post/why-north-miami-voting-precinct-draws-many-volunteers-and-fights">Miami-Dade County</a> polling place on Tuesday. Unfortunately business as usual meant campaign workers lining the sidewalks and shouting at voters in English and Creole, shoving fliers in the windows of passing cars and loud arguments. &#8220;This is a large precinct. There&#8217;s a lot of voters, there&#8217;s approximately 4,000 some odd registered voters. That means this. You know, the little fighting, the bickering comes out,&#8221; Alix Desulme, former North Miami city clerk told WLRN.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma</strong>: There were <a href="http://www.ktul.com/story/26376901/no-major-problems-reported-during-oklahoma-runoff">no major problems</a> reported with Oklahoma’s primary runoff on Tuesday, other than perhaps the <a href="http://www.news9.com/story/26377512/cost-of-oklahoma-runoff-elections-debated">cost</a> of actually conducting a primary runoff.</p>
<p>Although turnout numbers weren’t available by press time, based on reports, it doesn’t seem that the voter shaming website wwww.badvoter.org did much to boost voter turnout. David Glover, a “self-described political junkie” created the website, that allows anyone to look up any registered voter in Oklahoma’s <a href="http://www.mooreamerican.com/news/article_d6455e14-1e0a-51f3-960b-9bad1b9aefc5.html">voting history</a>.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Moore American</em>, the site provides the voters name, city of residence and the number days that have elapsed since the voter last cast a ballot. Glover told the paper the site is meant to put some social pressure on people and hopefully increase Oklahoma’s notoriously low turnout.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont</strong>: The biggest news out of Vermont following this week’s election was how the state’s <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/25/vote-results-secretary-state-office/14585893/">new election reporting system</a> would work. Overall they system seems to have worked and worked fairly well, but there were <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/27/vermont-election-follow/14708299/">some issues</a> including that the city of <a href="http://www.wcax.com/story/26387754/burlington-violates-vermont-election-law">Burlington</a> could not get all of their results loaded and worked until 1:30 in the morning before officials gave up for the night.</p>

<ul>
<li>A group calling itself the Virginia Voters Alliance has <a href="http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/state-regional/k-voter-registrations-challenged-in-fairfax/article_aef34fa7-896c-566a-9bd0-f398b03414b0.html">challenged the registrations of 15,000 voters in Fairfax County</a> claiming that the voters are also registered in Maryland. A Republican member of the county’s electoral board told the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em> that the county will reach out to the voters in question. The state’s attorney general’s office is <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/attorney-general-investigating-alleged-voter-fraud/article_f32443c4-4193-5dcf-95de-15768324d98c.html">now investigating</a>.
</li>
<li>According to Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, only one voter in Kansas who registered using the federal voter forms <a href="http://www.kwch.com/news/local-news/1-federally-registered-voter-voted-in-dual-system/27738536?ver=132">without proof-of-citizenship actually cast a ballot</a> in the August primary. There are 180 residents who used the federal form. Kobach told The Associated Press that his office is will working to determine how many of the more than 18,000 people whose registrations are on hold cast a provisional ballot.
</li>
<li>It’s one thing to misplace your keys, but how do you <a href="http://elections.wispolitics.com/2014/08/more-than-100-ballots-missing-in-17th.html">misplace more than 100 ballots</a>? That’s the question for officials in Green County, Wisconsin who told the state that following the vote canvass there are 110 ballots missing in a race that was decided by just seven votes. After interviewing poll workers, County Clerk Michael Doyle said it could not be determined where the ballots are so the requested recount will <a href="http://www.channel3000.com/news/politics/110-ballots-missing-in-17th-senate-district-recount/27742828">proceed without them</a>.
</li>
<li>The North Carolina State Board of Elections has put employees and appointed members of the state’s 100 county boards of elections on notice that the <a href="http://www.salisburypost.com/article/20140826/SP05/140829768/1012/patrick-gannon-elections-workers-on-notice-about-social-media-posts">SBE will be watching what they do on social media</a> and “liking” a candidate on Facebook could result in the loss of their job. Josh Howard, chairman of the SBE recently sent a memo the county boards warning that Facebook “likes” or retweets could end their job. According to <em>The Salisbury Post</em>, the five-member state board has stressed that it will strictly enforce a state law that bars elections board members and staffers from making written or oral statements intended for the public at large that support or oppose candidates.
</li>
<li>Bah humbug. In other news out of North Carolina, local craftspeople are upset with the Forsyth County BOE because the BOE is insisting on using the South Fork Recreation Center <a href="http://www.journalnow.com/news/elections/local/elections-board-majority-sticks-to-south-fork-plan/article_f539dc54-2cc9-11e4-8e03-0017a43b2370.html">for early voting which will displace the annual Holly Jolly Craft Show</a>, which will now likely have to be canceled.
</li>
<li>And with football season upon us (finally!) three cheers to the Johnson County, Iowa auditor’s office that will be bringing it’s <a href="http://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/local/2014/08/27/high-school-football-johnson-county-votemobile-november-election-early-voting/14712769/">votemobile to six high school football games</a> this fall in order to give residents a chance to vote early. &#8220;It&#8217;s just another way for the Auditor&#8217;s Office to reach out and increase voter turnout,&#8221; Johnson County Auditor Travis Weipert told the Iowa City Press-Citizen. &#8220;For people with kids, they&#8217;re busy and it can be hard to vote on Election Day, so now we&#8217;re kind of bringing voting to them.&#8221;

<ul>
<li>Late-arriving ballots, which make up 61 percent of uncounted ballots;</li>
<li>Ballots with no signature make up 20 percent of uncounted ballots; and</li>
