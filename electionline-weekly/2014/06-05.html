							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Not so Super Tuesday<br /></strong><em>Voters in 8 states head to polls this week, turnout light everywhere</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p>With voters in eight states—Alabama, California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota —heading to the polls or mailboxes this week, June 3 was the closest thing we’ll have to a Super Tuesday this election cycle.</p>
<p>Mississippi and Alabama both became the latest states to debut their voter photo ID laws and even though there were scattered reports of problems, there was very little fanfare about the launch.</p>
<p>And while otherwise there were bumps, glitches, snafus, delays, and guns at polling places, by-and-large things went well this week. The biggest story, which we will address in a later edition, was turnout, or lack thereof.</p>
<p>But for now, let’s take a look at what happened around the country on “Super” Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Alabama<br /></strong>The Yellowhammer State put its <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Officials-Alabama-s-photo-ID-law-working-smoothly-5526504.php">new voter photo ID law</a> to the test this week and the reports were mixed. In Huntsville, a 92-year-old voter was turned away because her <a href="http://blog.al.com/breaking/2014/06/voter_fraud.html">license had expired</a>. In some counties very <a href="http://whnt.com/2014/06/03/voter-id-few-temporary-ids-printed-on-election-day/">few temporary voter IDs</a> were issued.</p>
<p>There was other news besides voter ID of course. In <a href="http://www.waff.com/story/25686562/voters-allege-station-closed-10-minutes-before-deadline">Madison County</a>, some voters alleged that polling places were closed about 10 minutes prior to the 7p.m. deadline.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://blog.al.com/live/2014/06/officials_investigating_a_shor.html">Mobile County</a>, there were reports of ballot problems at the Dotch Community Center polling place because it’s a split precinct. And there were also reports that some polling places ran out of ballots.</p>
<p>Elections officials in <a href="http://www.clantonadvertiser.com/2014/06/04/county-sees-smooth-transition-with-upgraded-technology-during-june-3-primary-election/">Chilton County</a> were pleased with how the election went especially since not only were they implementing voter ID for the first time, but also because they were using new voting machines.</p>
<p>Poll workers in <a href="http://whnt.com/2014/06/04/colbert-co-probate-judge-poll-workers-distribute-incorrect-ballots-could-impact-tie-vote/">Colbert County</a> distributed incorrect ballot styles in a board of education race and with the race currently tied, officials are trying to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20140603/NEWS/140609948/1009?Title=SECRETARY-OF-STATE-Merrill-to-face-McKinney-in-runoff">secretary of state’s race</a> on the Republican side of the ticket, State Rep. John Merrill will face off against Reese McKinney in the July 15 runoff. The winner will face Democrat Lula Albert-Kaigler.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest news out of Alabama on Tuesday happened in <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2014/06/03/6454799/ala-man-told-to-store-loaded-gun.html">Shelby County</a>, when elections officials told a voter that he would have to remove his holstered pistols before entering the polling place.</p>
<p><strong>California<br /></strong>While at press time there are still hundreds of thousands of ballots waiting to be counted, the big news out of The Golden State, like everywhere else, was low voter turnout. In some areas <a href="http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20140604/articles/140609798">voter turnout</a> was a low as 13 percent in some counties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140603/no-ballots-no-voting-machines-and-other-glitches-at-los-angeles-county-polling-places">Los Angeles County</a> seemed to face the post problems on Tuesday with some of the county’s 5,000 polling places facing shortages of volunteers, missing ink and other materials and a lack of staffing.</p>
<p>Further north, elections officials in <a href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/breaking-news/ci_25891276/east-bay-election-day-glitches-explained">Contra Costa County </a>were busy troubleshooting issues at polling places throughout the day. The problems ranged from confused voters due polling place changes and technical glitches with machines.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-polling-place-ran-out-of-ballots-in-long-beach-20140603-story.html">Long Beach</a>, were voters were facing a “two vote Tuesday” there were reports that some polling places were running out of ballots near closing time.</p>
<p>For officials in <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/ballot-617107-ballots-boxes.html">Orange County</a>, it was one of those, whatever could go wrong, did go wrong days. A van carrying electronic votes broke down, a poll worker accidentally locked ballot boxes into the polling place and another poll worker couldn’t find the central tabulation center so they just took the ballots home with them. That being said, by midnight 96 percent of the votes cast had been tabulated.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-secretary-of-state-voting-results-20140603-story.html">race for secretary of state</a> Republican Pete Peterson will face Democratic State Sen. Alex Padilla. And although he was no longer a candidate and is facing criminal charges, former <a href="http://news.kron4.com/news/270000-plus-votes-puts-indicted-state-senator-leland-yee-in-third-place/">State Sen. Leland Yee</a> came in third place with approximately one in 10 Californians voting for him.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa<br /></strong>Mother Nature played the biggest role in Tuesday’s elections in The Hawkeye State. Anticipating problems during the afternoon, state elections officials encouraged voters to <a href="http://www.kcci.com/news/officials-encourage-early-voting-due-to-storms/26313756#!U0FRr">come out early in the day</a> to cast their ballots. In <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/elections/2014/06/03/storm-halts-voting-western-iowa/9932173/">Pottawattamie, Montgomery and Ringgold</a> counties, voting was temporarily halted when elections officials and voters had to seek shelter when a strong line of storms moved through.</p>
<p>IAnd t wasn’t the weather that was causing problems in <a href="http://www.kwwl.com/story/25679123/2014/06/03/johnson-county-elections-officials-dealing-with-computer-issues">Johnson County</a>, but early morning computer problems at several polling spots slowed down the process.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi<br /></strong>Like voters in Alabama, Mississippians were required to show a <a href="http://blog.gulflive.com/mississippi-press-news/2014/06/primary_election_running_smoot.html">photo ID</a> in order to cast a ballot for the first time and based on reports, all the pre-election work put in by state and local elections officials seems to have paid off <a href="http://www.wapt.com/politics/race-between-mcdaniel-cochran-expected-to-be-close/26303000">with few reported problems</a>.</p>
<p>In Hattiesburg, elections workers told a report that the new law seemed to be <a href="http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/story/news/politics/elections/2014/06/03/voter-id-well-received-at-kamer-park-precinct/9931143/">well received</a> by voters. And there were few reports of problems in <a href="http://www.wlox.com/story/25684711/voter-id-law">Jackson Count</a>y.</p>
<p>Ballots coded for one precinct that were used by other precincts in <a href="http://www.wlox.com/story/25685063/ballots-cause-election-snafu-in-harrison-county">Harrison County</a> and caused an early morning mix-up that was quickly resolved. The mix-up was blamed on <a href="http://www.wlox.com/story/25697118/human-error-blamed-on-ballot-mix-up">human error</a>. Elections results were delayed in <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2014/06/04/technical-difficulties-caused-late-election-results-rankin/9956989/">Rankin County</a> due to some technical problems</p>
<p>Despite things going well, Mother Nature did try to put a damper on things with <a href="http://www.sunherald.com/2014/06/03/5622390/weather-dampens-morning-voter.html">downpours</a> causing for light voter turnout in the morning hours.</p>
<p>And a strange situation in <a href="http://www.wapt.com/politics/election-commissioner-home-in-bed-couldnt-release-senate-numbers/26322100#!U0zFy">Covington County</a> played out on social media when an AP reporter tried to get elections results but was told by a county election commissioner that she was home and in bed and could not provide results.</p>
<p><strong>Montana<br /></strong>While not everyone adapts well to change, voters in <a href="http://billingsgazette.com/news/local/new-voting-setup-is-easier-on-voters-and-volunteers/article_abe3bfaa-cde1-5b68-9fda-e8fe83953b51.html">Billings</a> found the process much easier this time around at the Metra Pavillion. In past years voters were faced with long lines, but a new system allowing voters to check in, regardless of their original precinct essentially sped up the system and eliminated any lines. In <a href="http://www.abcfoxmontana.com/story/25685634/missoula-counting-election-officials-make-changes-for-voters">Missoula</a>, elections officials were able to take advantage of the low-turnout primary and conduct a “dress rehearsal” on some changes at the voting center.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey<br /></strong>New Jersey has been <a href="http://thealternativepress.com/articles/relocation-of-polling-sites-issue-continues-in-we">proactively moving polling places out of schools</a> for safety reasons, but that has also caused some confusion for voters who were unaware that their long-time polling spot had move. In <a href="http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/warren-county/express-times/index.ssf/2014/06/voting_machines_replaced_in_al.html">Warren County</a>, two voting machines had to be replaced after they broke down. Voting was not delayed. A candidate in <a href="http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/06/voter_fraud_bayonne_runoff_election_june_10_peninsula_city_mark_smith_james_davis_jimmy_election_uns.html">Bayonne</a>, who will appear on a runoff ballot, is calling for stricter oversight after a video surfaced that may show attempted voter fraud. The race for <a href="http://www.centraljersey.com/articles/2014/06/04/the_princeton_packet/featured/doc538e9a8ef3c67177467038.txt">Princeton</a> council will come down to a handful of provisional ballots with the candidates currently separated by three votes. And in <a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/provisional-ballots-to-be-investigated-in-atlantic-county/article_ba706aa8-ec2c-11e3-9b20-0019bb2963f4.html">Atlantic County</a>, 93 provisional ballots have been challenged.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico<br /></strong>The biggest story out of The Land of Enchantment was a <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/410935/news/election-night-spat-kicks-off-nov-race.html">war of wards</a> between Secretary of State Dianna Duran (R) and Bernalillo County Clerk Maggie Toulouse Oliver (D). The two will face each other on the November ballot for the secretary of state seat.</p>
<p>According to the Albuquerque Journal, the election night tiff stemmed from a batch of early, unofficial returns posted on the secretary of state’s website shortly after the polls had closed. The early results were incorrect and ultimately replaced with the correct results and the secretary of state’s office blamed Toulouse Oliver for the error saying the county loaded a test document into the system. Toulouse Oliver disagreed.</p>
<p>“I’m left to conclude that either a huge mistake was made on their end and they were trying to cover their mistake by firing first, or that they took advantage of what they thought was my mistake to make me look bad,” Toulouse Oliver told the paper.</p>
<p>In other news, some voters were bothered by the heat, which almost hit triple digits in some areas on Tuesday. And <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/410280/riowest/heat-construction-irk-voters-at-sabana-grande.html">construction at a polling place</a> caused some headaches for voters and elections officials alike. State police responded to reports of voter fraud in <a href="http://www.kob.com/article/stories/S3462264.shtml">McKinley County</a>, but the county clerk said there were no irregularities on election night.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota<br /></strong>Overall, there were <a href="http://www.keloland.com/newsdetail.cfm/polling-locations-learn-from-primary-problems/?id=165362">few reports of problems</a> throughout South Dakota. And like in most other states casting ballots, <a href="http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/politics/2014/06/03/sf-voting-places-reporting-low-morning-turnout/9914611/">turnout was quite low</a>. Voters in <a href="http://www.drgnews.com/2014/06/04/hughes-county-finance-officer-says-vote-center-locations-worked-well/">Hughes County</a> used vote centers for the first time this week and voters and elections officials seemed generally pleased with the process. In <a href="http://www.kdlt.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=36335&amp;Itemid=57">Davison County</a>, a new up-to-date vote counting machine failed to fire properly and did not read about 700 ballots. Voters in <a href="http://www.kdlt.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=36311&amp;Itemid=57">Minnehaha County</a> voters went back to individual polling places as opposed to voter centers and there was some confusion over that. And unlike in 2012, there were no long lines or parking problems in <a href="http://www.keloland.com/newsdetail.cfm/no-waiting-in-brandon-this-time/?id=165310">Brandon</a>.</p>

<p>Comments on <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2014/1226-electionlineweekly-march-20-2014">“Turning Out or Turning Away? Ballot Accessibility for People with Disabilities”</a></p>
<p>Lisa Schur, Ph.D, J.D., Rutgers University<br />Diane Cordry Golden, Ph.D., Association of Assistive Technology Act Programs</p>
<p>This paper addresses an important issue — the experiences and preferences of people with disabilities regarding voting.</p>
<p>While the data can be used to provide some useful descriptive information on the barriers encountered by people with disabilities, there are a number of serious methodological problems that limit the comparisons that can be made.</p>
<p>Apart from these methodological problems, the data the authors present do not support their two main conclusions and those conclusions appear to be based on a perception that “voting with human assistance” is acceptable and individuals with disabilities should have a right to vote “privately and independently” as guaranteed by HAVA.</p>
<p>First, the methodological problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sample is drawn from two sources—membership lists of disability organizations and service providers, and a list of registered voters over the age of 80. While it’s understandable to use disability organization lists as a way to save money, many people with disabilities are not part of these organizations, so the results cannot be generalized to all people with disabilities. The non-disabled sample appears to come wholly from the over-80 group of registered voters, who are obviously not representative of all non-disabled citizens due to both the age restriction and the voter registration restriction. Also, many of these people over 80 who do not self-identify as having a disability nonetheless have significant impairments and would qualify as having a disability under standard measures.</li>
<li>The data collection is by mail survey and Internet, with a response rate of only 15%. The self-selected sample is likely to be highly unrepresentative, both because many people with disabilities do not have computer access, and because people who take the time and effort to respond to mail surveys are those who are most likely to be interested in the topic. This is strongly indicated by the finding that over 90% of respondents say they vote regularly, which is much higher than in the general population.</li>
<li>The study attempts to make a comparison of 2012 <a href="http://www.marincounty.org/depts/rv/election-info/past-elections/page-data/tabs-collection/2012/nov-2012/final-election-results">voter turnout levels</a> among voters with disabilities in Marin County, all of California, and the U.S. But apart from the select nature of the sample, the survey does not even ask respondents whether they voted in 2012. The paper does not use a standard turnout question but apparently bases it’s finding on responses to the question “If you have voted in the past, how often you vote? [sic]” The finding that 97 percent of people without disabilities, and 92 percent of people with disabilities, voted is way out of line with data from the Census Bureau and Marin County Registrar that only 66.5 percent of the voting-eligible population voted in 2012. This supports the idea that it’s a highly unrepresentative, select sample.</li>
<li>To be scientifically valid, measures have to be distinct from the outcomes they are trying to predict. The disability measure is problematic, asking “What is the functional limitation you have that interferes with your ability to vote?” This non-standard measure is tied up with the outcome being assessed, which makes it an invalid predictor. In addition, the measure conflates the effect of impairment and environment—for example, it may be that an inaccessible polling place causes an interference with the ability to vote, but an accessible polling place would not interfere with voting so that a respondent with a disability would answer “no” to the question and not be counted as having a disability.</li>
<li>One conclusion is that “The use of [accessible voting machines (AVS)] among the disabled population is not significant, however, this is not due to the lack of AVS availability.” But the paper reports that only 76.4 percent of respondents said they had never used an AVS, which indicates that 23.6 percent, or nearly one-fourth, have used one. This is a large number, particularly given that most people with disabilities do not need to use accessible voting machines. Rather than downplaying this result, the study should pay substantial attention to the high reported rate of accessible machine usage, especially since many accessible machines can still pose problems for people with disabilities. The cited <a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/gao-13-538sp">GAO study</a> said that while almost all visited polling places had an accessible voting system, “46 percent of polling places had an accessible voting system that could pose a challenge to certain voters with disabilities, such as voting stations that were not arranged to accommodate voters using wheelchairs.” (The finding that usage of AVS does not significantly differ by disability type is a side issue that has little bearing on the question of whether accessible machines are important in general.)</li>
<li>Another conclusion is that “voting by mail has a significant impact on the turnout of disabled voters—more so than the (un)availability of any machine.” There is no test made of this hypothesis. While a majority in this select sample said they would prefer to vote by mail, there is no test of how this preference influences the likelihood of voting. Similarly, there is no test of how the availability of an AVS influences the likelihood of voting, so there is no basis for the statement that “the mode of voting is a more significant explicator of turnout than disability.”</li>
<li>The finding that 8.3 percent of people with disabilities say they would prefer to vote on an accessible machine, as well as 17.5 percent of people without disabilities(!), indicates that there is a real need for accessible voting machines. (The high rate for people without disabilities probably reflects that they are drawn from the over-80 population, or else reflects bad question design.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from these methodological problems, the conclusions don’t follow from the data presented.</p>
<p>There are numerous statements in the study that indicate the authors do not make a value distinction between voting with human assistance and voting privately and independently. It appears either is seen as acceptable so long as the voter turnout is improved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The study states “There are two important revelations about voting methods based on our study results; one that accessible machines have limited consequence, and second that voting by mail has more impact. As relates to the first, for those who want to vote at the polls, polling place accessibility (i.e. location) and machine usability is more important than machines designed to be accessible for voters with disability.”</p>
<p>While polling place “accessibility” is indeed a critical issue, that term does not mean the “location” of a polling place to people with disabilities. Polling place “accessibility” means a person with a disability can get into the building and into the polling place without physical barriers (inaccessible entrance with steps, etc.) Machine “usability” is also important but is meaningless if your disability prevents you from accessing the voting system at all. A blind individual will not care much about usability if the voting system does not provide an audio-tactile ballot.</p>
<p>Usability will mean nothing to a quadriplegic who has no switch access to be able to mark, verify or cast a ballot (and if they cannot get into the building, nothing else will matter.) The goal for individuals with disabilities should be “voting privately and independently” not just “voting”.</p>
<p>The study also states “Public policy has required that specially designed accessible machines be at every polling place, but disabled voters are not using them. Based on the low usage of the target population, the policy is arguably a costly failure.” Using this logic, almost all accessibility requirements are a “cost failure” because the number of individuals using them is small.</p>
<p>Talking ATMs are used by a very small portion of individuals, but we do not consider that a “costly failure”. Visual fire alarms are required by a very small portion of the population, but we do not consider them to be a “costly failure”. With training, most individual with disabilities can use accessible voting systems to vote privately and independently.</p>
<p>And the study states “. . . at least one-third of the electorate cannot leave their houses. If these citizens are to vote they must have transportation assistance or be able to vote by mail, and even if they vote by mail they may need assistance in getting their ballot into the mail &#8212; such assistance is sporadically available if at all in most jurisdictions across the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed many individuals with disabilities have transportation challenges and voting from home is convenient or perhaps necessary – however, that does not mean these individuals want to give up their right to vote privately and independently which a mail-in paper ballot will not provide. Paper ballots are inherently inaccessible – many if not most individuals with disabilities will require human assistance marking the ballot, verifying the ballot content, getting the marked ballot into an envelope, and mailing the ballot resulting in no privacy or independence.</p>
<p>The study summarizes by stating “. . . our findings indicate that both the disabled and non-disabled face challenges when using voting machines, however, guaranteeing access to the ballot has little to do with machines. If improving access to the ballot is the goal, then the availability of mail balloting should be expanded.” The use of the phrase “access to the ballot” appears to mean “availability of the ballot to the voter” rather than an accessible ballot is available to a voter with a disability. It is quite simple to make available an inaccessible paper ballot to voters at home if you are not concerned with the right to vote privately and independently.</p>
<p>In sum, the study is based on a very unrepresentative sample, and therefore cannot be used to draw firm conclusions on the general voting experiences and preferences of people with disabilities. The comparisons with state and national data are invalid. Even disregarding methodological problems, the data do not support the authors’ conclusions, and instead show the use of accessible voting machines by almost one-fourth of people with disabilities.</p>
<p>If a conclusion were to be drawn from these data, it is that voting by mail and accessible voting machines should not be seen as an either/or choice. There is a continuing need for accessible voting technology to ensure that people with disabilities have the same options as people without disabilities in exercising the right to vote privately and independently. In addition, all kinds of remote voting should be explored to support individuals with disabilities vote privately and independently without requiring them to travel to a polling place.</p>
<p>Eli Gelardin, the Executive Director of the Marin Center for Independent Living eloquently summarizes the concerns of the disability community with the conclusions of this study –</p>
<p>&#8220;Increasing voter turnout and protecting voter civil rights are not mutually exclusive. While it is critically important to increase voter turnout for all individuals, including individuals with disabilities, it cannot come at the expense of reducing physical and programmatic access at polling places and the availability of accessible voting machines. A blanket mail-in balloting policy is simply not a fair or appropriate solution. Voting privately and independently is a protected right of every American.&nbsp;&nbsp; As an individual with a disability, running a 35 year-old community based organization that serves over 700 individuals with disabilities annually, I strongly support the Help America Vote Act which guarantees every American equal access at polling places and the ability to cast a private and independent ballot.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2014/06/02/Elections-officials-point-to-ghost-in-machine-for-voter-registration-error.html">“technical glitch”</a> in Lucas County, Ohio changed the party affiliation of as many as 167 voters to the Green Party. According to The Toledo Blade Elections Director Gina Kaczala&nbsp;said a mistake was most likely made when the polling books were “wanded” as part of the vote-canvassing process, which occurred between the election and May 27. She said the board will fix the mistakes. Kaczala said that had a Green Party member not found the problem, it would have come up when auditing the precinct books. Kaczala also said that this problem seems to come up every year. “Every single year this happens. It‘s nothing new,” said Ms. Kaczala, who took over as election director March 4. &#8220;This is why we need electronic poll books,“ Kaczala told the paper. ”It eliminates human error.“
</li>
<li>More voter shaming, this time in Oregon. According to <em>The Oregonian</em>, a list of voters who made <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/05/names_of_oregon_voters_who_mad.html">signature mistakes on their primary ballots</a> is publicly available at county clerks’ offices. In 2013, legislators approved <a href="http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2013/HB3344/">House Bill 3344</a> that allows elections offices to release the names of voters with challenged ballot signatures. The name, residence and reason the ballot is being challenged are available eight days after an election. A voter has 14 days after the election to correct a challenged ballot. The Oregon Association of County Clerks opposed the legislation in 2013.
</li>
<li>If the city council approves the request, poll workers in New York City could become some of, if not the highest paid poll workers in the country. The city’s board of elections recently requested an <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/board-elections-raise-pay-pollworkers-article-1.1813421">additional $7.4 million dollars that would raise the average poll workers salary</a> to $300 and $400 for supervisors. They would each receive an additional $100 for six hours of training.
</li>
<li>Pro tip: If you’re going to <a href="http://www.twincities.com/crime/ci_25897684/he-voted-anoka-county-and-texas-then-bragged">commit voter fraud</a>, you might not want to take to social media to brag about it. Case-in-point, a Texas man was fined $4,000 after he plead guilty to misdemeanor for voting absentee in Texas and Minnesota.
</li>
<li><strong>Law &amp; Order: </strong>The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals announced this week that it will hear arguments in the federal <a href="http://www.kwch.com/news/local-news/Court-taking-up-Kansas-Arizona-voter-suit-Aug-25/26296354">proof-of-citizenship case</a> on August 25. Congressional Democrats have filed an <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/208269-house-dems-file-amicus-brief-on-voter-registration-laws">amicus brief</a> in the case. The Supreme Court is taking a look at <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/06/02/supreme-court-alabama-voting-rights-blacks/9865197/">voting rights</a> again this session when they agreed this week to hear arguments whether or not Alabama violated the Constitution by “allegedly packing black voters into some state legislative districts making it more difficult for black office-seekers to be elected elsewhere.” In New Mexico, a lawsuit filed this week argues that <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/409056/news/lawsuit-to-challenge-state-voting-rule.html">barring unaffiliated voters</a> from participating the state’s closed primary violates the state constitution. U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason this week overruled Alaska election officials and said the constitutional right to vote requires that the state translate all election materials into <a href="http://www.adn.com/2014/06/04/3502213/feds-say-state-election-officials.html?sp=/99/188/189/">Native languages</a> for voters with limited English skills. In Texas, the Speaker of the Texas House and 27other legislators asked a federal judge to quash subpoenas in the federal case with the U.S. Department of Justice over the state’s <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/06/04/68431.htm">voter ID law</a>. An Outagamie County, Wisconsin judge has thrown out the county’s April 1 election for a county board seat and <a href="http://www.postcrescent.com/article/20140604/APC0101/306040340/Judge-orders-new-election-disputed-Outagamie-County-race">ordered the county conduct a new election</a>. The ruling was the result of poll workers providing incorrect ballots to 84 voters and the margin of victory being within 84 votes.

<p><strong>California</strong>: The Assembly has sent the Senate a bill that would allow localities to conduct all <a href="http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2014/05/29/3085970/capitol-alert-assembly-approves.html">vote-by-mail elections for special elections</a>. Under the bill, special elections to fill vacancies in the Legislature or Congress could be conducted exclusively by mail if the boards of supervisors in all involved counties agree.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois</strong>: By a vote of 64-41, the Illinois Legislature approved a bill that will allow for <a href="http://www.ksdk.com/story/news/local/illinois/2014/05/30/election-day-registration-bill-goes-to-gov-quinn/9798461/">election-day registration</a> beginning in time for the November 2014 elections. In addition, the law would extend in-person early voting hours, remove ID requirements for in-person early voting and allow public universities to serve as locations for election day, in-person absentee voting. Gov. Pat Quinn is expected to sign the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: Lawmakers recently repealed an ages old state law that prevented the <a href="http://www.vagazette.com/news/sns-rt-us-usa-south-carolina-liquor-20140529,0,6813573.story">sales of alcohol on election day</a>.

Grose, University of Southern California, USC CLASS Research Paper No. 14-17, April 8, 2014; A recent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/06/03/study-finds-strong-evidence-for-discriminatory-intent-behind-voter-id-laws/" shape="rect">study</a> concludes that legislative support for voter ID laws is in part motivated by discriminatory intent. The researchers conducted an experiment in 28 U.S. legislative chambers, randomly assigning legislators to receive email messages from Latino, Anglo, English-speaking, and Spanish-speaking constituents. These messages asked if a driver’s license is required for voting. Legislators who supported voter ID laws were much more likely to respond to Anglo constituents’ requests than Latino constituents.</p>
