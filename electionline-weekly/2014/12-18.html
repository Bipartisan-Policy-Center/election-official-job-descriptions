							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>The writing is on the ballot and petition and envelope<br /></strong><em>Does penmanship — good or bad — affect elections?</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti</a></p>
<p><em>“A signature always reveals a man’s character — and sometimes even his name.”</em></p>
<p>Everyone has heard the jokes about doctor’s signatures and handwriting that looks like chicken scratch but what impact does your questionable handwriting have on your ability to participate in democracy?</p>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p>For instance, according to Neal Kelley, registrar of voters for <a href="http://www.ocvote.com/">Orange County, California</a> and president of the <a href="https://caceo.memberclicks.net/login?servId=1461">California Association of Clerks and Election Officials</a>, poor penmanship has not played a major role as the county moves more and more to vote-by-mail ballots.</p>
<p>“It is not a significant problem, “ Kelley said. “While there are difficulties on occasion our rejection rate of ballots due to an inability to decipher some bit of information on the ballot was zero for the 2014 general election.&nbsp;We do, of course, have to sometimes contact the voter to clarify information and/or deal with signature issues.”</p>
<p>Kelley noted that California law is pretty clear on the governance of the issue and recent changes have given local elections officials more options to verify signatures.</p>
<p>“So now we could use address residency cards, voter notification cards, etc. — essentially anything we have on file with the voter&#8217;s signature,” Kelley said. “This provides additional options to verify a signature of a voter that may have changed over time.“</p>
<p>Up the coast in Washington State where many voters have been voting by mail since the 1990s, <a href="http://www.sos.wa.gov/">Secretary of State Kim Wyman</a> said that voters seem to understand the importance of signing ballots legibly.</p>
<p>“Penmanship oddly enough is pretty consistent throughout a person’s life, and election administrators get training from signature experts at our State Patrol,” Wyman said. “Sometimes we’ll see our younger voters change their signature style when they move into a professional setting, and sometimes our older voters’ handwriting will change due to illness, arthritis, stroke or something like that. We then work with them on a new signature.”</p>
<p>In Oregon, the state contacted about 13,000 voters whose signatures on their vote-by-mail ballot did not match a signature the state had on file.</p>
<p>According to the Tony Green, spokesman for the <a href="http://sos.oregon.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Oregon Secretary of State’s</a> office, less than 1 percent of the 1.5 million ballots cast were not initially counted because the signature didn&#8217;t match or the voter did not sign the envelope.</p>
<p>Ultimately about 66 percent of the 13,000 voters corrected their signature problems.</p>
<p>That did not stop a group of activists from <a href="http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/tech/science/environment/2014/12/08/lawsuit-filed-oregon-gmo-labeling-recount/20103591/">suing</a> the state during the GMO ballot initiative recount. The activists challenged about 4,600 ballots. Their attorneys argued that that is not part of Oregon law that a voter signature on ballots match registration cards. A Multnomah County judge <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/12/measure_92_judge_says_no_to_re.html">denied</a> the suit.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not just signatures on vote-by-mail ballots where handwriting comes into play. There are also write-in campaigns and in many states, ballot initiatives. Kelley noted that penmanship is definitely more of an issue with initiatives.</p>
<p>“This is definitely more of a problem for us than on VBMs,” Kelley said. “These are much ‘messier’ than VBMs – many times because voters are moving much quicker when signing a petition. I don&#8217;t have rejection rates for you but I can tell you anecdotally that this is more of a problem.”</p>
<p>In 2010, <a href="http://www.elections.alaska.gov/">Alaska</a> conducted a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Alaska,_2010">write-in election</a> for U.S. Senate. While the election was plagued with litigation, Director of Elections Gail Fenumiai said that penmanship wasn’t really the issue as obviously incorrect spelling of candidates’ names.</p>
<p>“Penmanship only mattered to the extent that you could read what was written,” Fenumiai said, who was responsible for reviewing any questionable ballots. “I was the one to look at any questions or challenged ballots and I recall very few, if any at all.”</p>
<p>Following the election, <a href="http://juneauempire.com/stories/021511/reg_785799898.shtml">legislation</a> was introduced giving voters the benefit of the doubt when writing in a candidate’s name.</p>
<p>Up till now, anecdotally, penmanship has not been a major issue for elections officials, however with the introduction of the <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/">Common Core</a> educational standards that did not include cursive writing as part of the core, and with people writing — as opposed to typing — less and less, there are concerns about the future.</p>
<p>Lori Augino, Washington state elections director, said next-gen verification methods are on her radar screen, especially as she works with FVAP, Council of State Governments, Pew and others in the field.</p>
<p>“It’s a good thing to be talking about,” she said.&nbsp; “We are not feeling an urgency about it right now, but we need to look at what solutions from technology might give us in the next 10 years. Working with our military voters looks like a good place to start.</p>
<p>“The challenges will get greater as we have more and more students who reach 18 and have not learned to sign their name.”</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/">National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, while several states have introduced legislation requiring cursive writing as part of the curriculum, only four states — Idaho, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee — have actually approved such legislation in varying forms.</p>
<p>Wyman said she’s sorry to see some schools not providing instruction in cursive handwriting and would support a mandate for that.</p>
<p>Oh and for those who may be inclined to celebrate, <a href="http://www.cute-calendar.com/event/national-handwriting-day/18116.html">National Handwriting Day</a> 2015 will be celebrated January 23.</p>

We will however publish our much anticipated What’s In and Out 2015 on Wednesday, December 31, 2014. We’ll be back to our regularly weekly schedule on January 8, 2015.</p>

														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a holiday miracle! Late in the day on Tuesday, with the final minutes of the session waning, the U.S. Senate approved <a href="http://democrats.senate.gov/2014/12/16/nominations-agreed-to-by-consent-and-voice-votes/#.VJGIoyf1-Do">three new commissioners to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>. We’ll have more on the new commissioners in the coming weeks, but in the mean time, welcome Tom Hicks, (term expires in 2017), Matthew Masterson (term expires in 2017) and Christy McCormick (term expires in 2015).
</li>
<li>A recent <a href="http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/12/audit-details-problems-wisconsin-elections-board/20297693/">audit of the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board</a> pointed out a variety of problems with the bipartisan board including that staff did not consistently follow a penalty schedule for enforcing campaign finance, lobbying and code of ethics laws; did not conduct 16 reviews required by law over a four-year period to identify felons who may have voted illegally; and did not put into place written procedures for considering complaints. While members of the states GOP jumped on the audit to reinforce their calls to disband the GAB, the auditors did not recommend the board be overhauled or dismantled, but did say the Legislature could increase the GAB’s authority over elections and improve its operations. At an <a href="http://www.channel3000.com/news/gab-director-defends-agency-walker-says-hes-open-to-change/30265394">agency meeting this week</a>, Director Kevin Kennedy said changes are in the works to rectify problems found by the audit. &#8220;I get a little defensive when they point out that we&#8217;re not adhering to the law in terms of how we&#8217;re enforcing matters or tracking things,&#8221; Kennedy said during the meeting. &#8220;A lot of it has more to do with how the records are organized and how reporting is getting to the board.&#8221; The board voted to ask the GAB to give it a list of all 34 recommendations and report progress at the next two meetings.
</li>
<li>Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliff (D) is proposing spending <a href="http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/state-regional/mcauliffe-proposes-million-to-replace-voting-machines-around-the-state/article_b4135509-b4be-510a-bce5-b4198a6d3bfa.html">$28 million to upgrade the state’s voting systems</a> including voting machines, e-pollbooks and the state’s elections website. According to The Richmond Times-Dispatch, under the proposal, the state would cover the cost of purchasing new voting machines for 2,166 precincts statewide. The state would reimburse 401 precincts that have already purchased new optical scan machines. The proposal will need to be approved by the Legislature as part of the budget process.
</li>
<li>Three more states are considering joining Georgia, Tennessee, Texas and Florida for a so-called <a href="http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/12/11/three-more-states-aim-to-join-georgia-bid-for-sec-primary-in-16/">SEC Primary</a>. Secretaries of state in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi have told Georgia’s Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is spearheading the effort, that they will work with their respective legislatures to get the primaries moved to March 1. Kemp is also working with Louisiana and South Carolina to get them onboard as well.
</li>
<li>The Iowa Voter Registration Commission is working on draft rules that would allow Iowans to <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Voter-rights-groups-seek-changes-to-online-voting-5963759.php">register online to vote</a>, however advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union are concerned about the provision in the rules that would limit those who use the online system to just those who have a driver’s license.
</li>
<li><strong>Recount Updates</strong>: The <a href="http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/121714_mcsally_barber/mcsally-wins-by-167-votes-after-recount/">CD2 recount in Arizona</a> is finally over with Republican challenger Martha McSally defeating incumbent Rep. Ron Barber by 167 votes. The final vote difference was only six votes different from the original tally. This was the first congressional recount in the state. A judge has ordered the <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2014/12/17/questions-remain-clark-election-recount/20549001/">Clark County, Indiana recount</a> commission to certify a recount that flipped the original results of the race. Although questions still remain about the recount process, the winning candidate for circuit court clerk won by 43 votes.

							<h2>Legal Update</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;III. Legal Update</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama</strong>: The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court’s ruling that third-party political candidates must submit <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Court-upholds-Ala-ballot-access-requirements-5963361.php">tens of thousands of voter signatures</a> before gaining access to a statewide ballot. The court said that plaintiffs failed to show how the requirement is overly burdensome.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas</strong>: On Tuesday, a complaint was filed with the Mississippi County Circuit Court alleging that there were many “potential unpardoned, convicted felons, who are prohibited from voting” who cast ballots in the recent <a href="http://www.couriernews.net/story/2148250.html">Blytheville mayoral election</a>.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong>: The Salinas city attorney is filing a writ of mandate asking a judge to <a href="http://www.kionrightnow.com/news/local-news/salinas-city-attorney-taking-legal-action-to-stop-a-special-election/30286536">stop a special election</a> in March. &#8220;A writ of mandate is a request of the superior court asking them to order the registrar of voters of Monterey County to not put the special tax initiative on the ballot in March of 2015,&#8221; city attorney Chris Callihan told KION.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado</strong>: A group of Adams County voters, lead by activist Marilyn Marks <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27154609/adams-county-clerk-scott-gessler-sued-over-ballot">filed</a> a lawsuit against county elections officials and Secretary of State Scott Gessler after it was disclosed that due to an error by the county’s vendor Runbeck Election Systems, printed and mailed ballots about 200,000 ballots that could be <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27143952/adams-county-ballot-troubles-could-wind-up-court?source=rss">directly traced back to individual voters</a>. A unique number was printed both on the ballot and the return envelope. County Clerk Karen Long discovered the problem in October but it was not disclosed until December 9. The suit demands that the judge void the election.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi</strong>: The Hinds County commission voted this week to <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2014/12/15/hinds-pay-attorney-defend-election-commission/20457843/">pay a lawyer to defend the county election commission</a> in a lawsuit filed over the number of ballots required by state law. Some members of the commission suggested that Election Commission Chairwoman Connie Cochran should be required to pay for the defense herself.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The New Hampshire Civil Liberties Union has filed suit against the state on behalf of three voters who posted <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2014/12/12/368017789/is-a-ban-on-ballot-selfies-overkill">ballot selfies</a> on social media. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argue that New Hampshire’s law prohibiting the photographing of one’s own ballot is an infringement on the First Amendment. &#8220;The issue is the chilling effect this law has on people being able to engage in political speech outside the polling place,&#8221; attorney Gilles Bissonnette told NPR. &#8220;It is now prohibited one week, six months, one year later from publishing that ballot to engage in core political speech.&#8221; Dave Scanlan, deputy secretary of state, told the network it&#8217;s a necessary addition to prevent a new era of high-tech vote buying. &#8220;The law was updated as a preventative measure to keep the door closed on voter fraud,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People coming out against it are not considering the issues that election administrators see with trying to make sure that the elections are free from voter fraud and that they&#8217;re fair.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina:</strong> The North Carolina Court of Appeals confirmed a lower court decision that Guilford County’s <a href="http://www.news-record.com/news/n-c-court-of-appeals-upholds-payout-for-former-guilford/article_5e7c0a06-8540-11e4-9a41-e3ab8ec2786b.html">former board of elections director George Gilbert was underpaid</a>. Following his 2013 retirement after 25 years on the job, Gilbert filed suit claiming he should have been paid a rate close to those in counties similar in size. The lower court agreed and awarded him $38,500. “Hopefully, counties will read this ruling and change the way they do business,” Gilbert told The News-Record. “This gives my peers a much firmer ground to stand on.” Prior to this suit, there was no case law on salary requirements for election directors.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee</strong>: The state’s Attorney General has asked a federal court to <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2014/12/15/state-attorneys-ask-judge-dismiss-amendment-lawsuit/20446355/">dismiss a lawsuit challenging the validity of the November 4 Amendment 1 vote</a>. The Amendment was approved with about 53 percent of the vote, but three days after the election opponents of the measure filed suit challenging the method elections officials used to count the ballots. In their request for dismissal, lawyers for the state argued that the arguments of the plaintiffs are contrary to legislative intent behind state election laws and contrary to long-standing practices of how ballots are counted.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Virgin Islands:</strong> The St. Croix <a href="http://virginislandsdailynews.com/news/judge-issues-arrest-warrant-for-supervisor-of-elections-1.1803461">recount saga continues</a> this week with a superior court judge issuing a warrant for Elections Supervisor Caroline Fawkes after she failed to appear at a Monday hearing. Attorneys for both candidates involved in the recount subpoenaed Fawkes. When she failed to show — because apparently she was <a href="http://virginislandsdailynews.com/news/fawkes-observing-florida-elections-despite-contempt-charge-1.1803982">in Florida</a> meeting with elections officials there — the judge issued a bench warrant and set bail at $5,000.</p>

<p><strong>District of Columbia: </strong>The Council of the District of Columbia voted to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-primary-election-date-to-remain-a-moving-target/2014/12/17/4bb34140-8609-11e4-9534-f79a23c40e6c_story.html">move the city’s primary</a> from the first Tuesday in April—a switch to comply with the MOVE Act—to June in 2016, when it would be combined with the presidential primary and September in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia: </strong>The Troup County Commission will consider this week whether or not to <a href="http://lagrangenews.com/news/news/50854510/Commissioners-mull-shrinking-elections-board">constrict the county’s board of elections and registration</a> from the current seven appointed members to just three. If approved by the county commission, the measure would also have to be approved by the state legislature.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas</strong>: The Kansas Legislature is considering <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2014/dec/12/shew-warns-legislative-panel-about-moving-local-el/">moving local elections to November</a>, but some of the state’s clerks are speaking out against the proposal. Douglas County Clerk Jamie Shew told the Ethics, Elections and Local Government Committee that the state should look at other alternatives to increase turnout — vote-by-mail — to increase turnout instead of moving the elections.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan</strong>: A House committee has approved legislation that would eliminate the requirement that <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2014/12/16/house-panel-agrees-strike-petition-voting-rule/20479233/">petition circulators be registered voters</a>. The Elections and Ethics Committee voted 9-0 to move the legislation to the full House.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Under a bill sponsored by Councilman Ben Kallos (D-Manhattan) <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/early-voting-nyc-new-bill-blog-entry-1.2047579">early voting</a> would come to Gotham. Under the bill, the city would have to open at least 51 early voting sites beginning two Tuesdays before an election. The sites would be open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends until the Friday before the election.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: Senate Minority Leader Mac Schneider is considering introducing legislation that would eliminate the state’s <a href="http://news.prairiepublic.org/post/legislative-session-could-bring-proposed-changes-voting-law">voter photo ID</a> and instead revert to the old system that required a voter to swear under oath.
