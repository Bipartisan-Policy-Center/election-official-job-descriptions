							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>As officials in Texas recover from Harvey, East Coast braces for Irma</strong><br /><em>One way or another the election must go on</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>electionline</p>
<p>Mother Nature does not discriminate. She does not care if you are a red state or a blue state. She really does not care if you have an election next week or if that building her winds are about to topple is one of your polling places.</p>
<p>Currently counties in Texas are recovering from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Harvey">Hurricane Harvey</a> while preparing for a November election and cities in every state in <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?cone">Hurricane Irma’s path</a> have elections next week.</p>
<p>There are no off-years for elections or Mother Nature.</p>
<p>We reached out to about 20 of the most-impacted counties in Texas to find out how their elections offices fared during the storm and fortunately most of the news was good, although some counties are still trying to assess the damage.</p>
<p>Rachael Garcia, election administrator in <a href="http://www.co.refugio.tx.us/default.aspx?Refugio_County/Elections">Refugio County</a> said that her office had extensive water damage and that it will be weeks if not longer before the office will be open. In addition to the office, she and her family have also been displaced from their home.</p>
<p>Despite the damage to the elections office, Gracia said that while there was flooding at the county elections warehouse, all the equipment is safe and secure.</p>
<p>Other counties that we spoke with including <a href="http://www.co.bee.tx.us/default.aspx?Bee_County/TAC.Voter">Bee</a>, <a href="http://www.calhouncotx.org/electinfo.html">Calhoun</a>, <a href="http://co.chambers.tx.us/default.aspx?name=elections">Chambers</a>, and <a href="http://www.co.matagorda.tx.us/default.aspx?Matagorda_County/Elections">Matagorda</a> said their elections offices were not impacted by the storm and torrential rains.</p>
<p>Heather Hawthrone in Chambers County said that having been through Hurricane Ike, the elections office is prepared to deal with displaced voters and they will begin by reaching out by mail per precinct and then go from there.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.co.wharton.tx.us/default.aspx?Wharton_County/Elections">Wharton County</a>, Elections Administrator Cindy Richter said that while the office and warehouse were spared any damage from Hurricane Harvey, two polling places were damaged.</p>
<p>“We will just have to wait and see if they will be ready for November,” Richter said. “We are checking around for available locations.”</p>
<p>Pamela Hill, elections administrator for <a href="http://www.co.san-patricio.tx.us/default.aspx?San-Patricio_County/Elections">San Patricio County</a> said that three of the county voting locations have damage to the buildings but her greatest concern is reaching out to displaced voters.</p>
<p>“We are&nbsp;hoping we can send them mail ballots,” Hill said. “We will be posting on our website and Facebook page in hopes of reaching those displaced.”</p>
<p>John Oldham, election administrator in <a href="http://www.fortbendcountytx.gov/index.aspx?page=338">Fort Bend County</a> said one of the saving graces for many Texas counties affect by Harvey is that they already operate on a vote center system. Many of the county’s vote centers are in schools and with those not scheduled to re-open until next week he said it might be mid-month before his office could assess whether or not they need to find alternatives for November.</p>
<p>He said his office will use its customary methods for contacting voters about polling locations including required notices, the county website and social media such as Facebook and Next Door.</p>
<p>Because Fort Bend was lucky weathering Harvey, Oldham said that he would be reaching out to other impacted counties in the state to see what help his office may be able to provide.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong><br />Elections officials throughout the state are closely monitoring the storm and making sure all their emergency management plans are in place.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lee.vote/">Lee County</a> Supervisor of Elections Tommy Doyle has <a href="http://www.news-press.com/story/news/2017/09/06/fort-myers-cape-coral-early-voting-suspended-primary-election-question/635537001/">suspended early voting</a> for municipal elections in Cape Coral and Fort Meyers and is awaiting permission from Gov. Rick Scott (R) to postpone Tuesday’s primary in the municipalities.</p>
<p>Vicki Davis, <a href="http://www.martinvotes.com/">Martin County</a> supervisor of elections, has been attending briefings twice a day all week at the Emergency Management Complex and responded to emailed questions while county workers were boarding up the elections office windows. The supervisor of elections offices will be closed today and Friday.</p>
<p>Davis said during every hurricane season her office does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store enough election equipment, electronic pollbooks (EvIDS) and supplies to set up seven (7) vote centers throughout the county, if needed; and, equipment has been pre-tested for the upcoming November election;<br /> We have a virtual server which stores our voter registration database and the server is backed up in three different locations;</li>
<li>We have an election work station and tabulation server at the Public Safety Complex for back up;</li>
<li>Currently we have burned two sets of media for our city elections and have one set stored with the backup equipment and one set at the home of the Chief Deputy; and</li>
<li>We have placed our two 650 high speed tabulators in the vault for security; the voting equipment has been secured in the warehouse and we have a backup diesel generator to power the warehouse, computer server room and vault a/c units.</li>
</ul>
<p>Davis said ballot for the upcoming election are already in production and post-hurricane they will assess polling locations for any damages.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong><br />In South Carolina, where Gov. Henry McMaster has declared a <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/hurricane-guide/south-carolina-declares-state-of-emergency-seeks-federal-disaster-declaration/article_b69c24da-931d-11e7-9bae-139da7220370.html">state of emergency</a> ahead of a possible impact from Hurricane Irma new <a href="http://www.richlandonline.com/Government/Departments/Elections.aspx">Richland County</a> Elections Director Rokey Suleman said his office isn’t taking any chances and is keeping a close eye on the storm.</p>
<p>“We are keeping an eye on the weather forecasts but have begun to prep our warehouse for a significant weather event,” Ruleman said. “The county is having an emergency management meeting on Friday to discuss various contingencies. We have ordered sandbags and expect them to be placed around the warehouse by the weekend. The equipment is stored off of the ground and we will be covering the machines with tarps in case there is minor wind damage to the roof. If the building suffers major or catastrophic wind damage, we will adjust to the situation as best as possible.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orangeburg County Director of Voter Registration and Elections Aurora Smalls told <em>The T &amp; D</em> that Tuesday’s scheduled election in the City of Orangeburg will go on as scheduled, no matter what Irma may do.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking at emergency plans now for the election,” she told the paper. She said the election commission’s plans include finding alternative sites for precincts that are in low-lying areas that could potentially flood. Smalls said an assessment of the city&#8217;s voting places are under review.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong><br />Further north in North Carolina, officials there are too keeping a close eye on forecasts for Irma.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article171630437.html">City of Charlotte</a>, which had to move its 1989 primary because of Hurricane Hugo, has a primary scheduled for Tuesday the 12th.</p>
<p>“We are monitoring weather conditions closely,” Patrick Gannon, a spokesman for the state elections board told the <em>Charlotte Observer</em>.</p>
<p>According to the article, State Elections Director Kim Strach has the authority to postpone the election if necessary, but the paper said she will not make that call until forecasters have a better sense of the path of the storm.</p>
<p>Primaries are also scheduled in Cleveland and Cherokee counties on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>A little advice<br /></strong>We also reached out to officials in <a href="https://www.sos.la.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Louisiana</a> and <a href="http://www.njelections.org/">New Jersey</a> to get some advice from them about what to do when Mother Nature attempt to wreak havoc on your very carefully planned elections.</p>
<p>In 2005 <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/hurricane-katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> forced the postponement of the New Orleans mayoral election and forced the secretary of state’s office and officials in Orleans Parish to scramble to hold an election in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_mayoral_election,_2006">April of 2006</a>. In 2016, major portions of the state were impacted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Louisiana_floods">catastrophic flooding</a>.</p>
<p>Angie Rogers was <a href="https://www.sos.la.gov/Pages/default.aspx">director of elections</a> for the state in 2006 and last year.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing is identifying and opening up vote centers so displaced residents can vote,” Rogers said.</p>
<p>She said setting up an 800 number for people to call was also critical in both 2006 and 2016. Rogers noted that while social media played a much larger factor in 2016 than it did in 2006, the 800 was and still is critical because not everyone may have access to the Internet.</p>
<p>“You can’t forget about social media,” Rogers said. “You just can’t rely on it.”</p>
<p>Rogers said she is available to give advice to any affected county.</p>
<p>One week before the 2012 presidential election <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy">Superstorm Sandy</a> crashed into New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Despite the proximity to the election and the sheer devastation suffered in parts of each state, the election was held as scheduled on November 6.</p>
<p>“Every day things were changing,” said Robert Giles, director of elections for New Jersey. “We were working with power companies that were putting the grid back together to make sure they had a list of polling places.”</p>
<p>Giles noted that just because the power grid was back on did not mean that the power was back on in a polling place because there were still transformer issues.</p>
<p>The state brought in generators to voting sites and mobile voting buses to emergency shelters. The state also ended up treating all voters like UOCAVA voters.</p>
<p>To get some idea of what New Jersey did to make a successful 2012 election, the League of Women Voters of New Jersey created “<a href="https://vimeo.com/109842560">Storming the Vote</a>.”</p>

														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>Emails…why is it always emails? According to <em>The Hill</em>, in its lawsuit against the presidential election commission, the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law states that a attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice revealed at a meeting earlier this month that members of the presidential commission have been <a href="http://thehill.com/regulation/legislation/349488-trump-voter-fraud-commission-violated-federal-rules-lawsuit-claims">using their personal email accounts</a> rather than federal government-issued accounts to conduct business of the commission.</p>
<p>“Such use of personal email violates the Presidential Records Act (PRA), which Congress amended in 2014 specifically to require that all persons covered by the PRA — including members of this Commission — use official federal government email to conduct government business,” the Lawyer’s Committee argued in a status report.</p>
<p>The commission is set to meet on Sept. 12 in New Hampshire and according to WMUR the <a href="https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/electioncommissionagenda-1504747898.pdf">agenda</a> for the meeting has a heavy emphasis on voter confidence in the process. Secretary of State William Gardner told New Hampshire Primary Source that he was involved in formulating the agenda and has tried to gather experts in the history of election turnout statistics and how “integrity issues” have affected turnout over the past several decades. Vice President Mike Pence who is chair of the commission will not be at the meeting and the meeting will be lead by Vice Chairman Kris Kobach.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho—The</strong> secretary of state’s office announced this week that it has <a href="http://boisestatepublicradio.org/post/idaho-hands-over-public-voter-data-trump-panel#stream/0">complied with the request</a> from the election commission after the commission completed the state’s official public records request form and paid the $20 fee to obtain the records electronically. &#8220;They filled out the same request like everyone else,&#8221; Deputy Secretary of State Tim Hurst told KBSX. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t have to deny anything because they just asked for public information.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: North Carolina has also forwarded the election commission a copy of the <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/under-the-dome/article171645222.html">publicly available voter information</a>. The information sent to the commission does not include social security numbers, signatures and dates of birth. According to the <em>News &amp; Observer</em>, the state also sent a copy of the audit from the 2016 election which found 508 people — mostly convicted felons serving active sentences — had voted illegally.</p>
<p>In an accompanying letter to the commission, Kim Westbrook Strach, executive director of the board of elections cautioned that instances of noncitizen voting are not easy to catch.</p>
<p>“North Carolina voters who appeared to be non-citizens based on DMV data were later confirmed to be U.S. citizens 97.6 percent of the time” when checked against a Homeland Security database, she wrote. Even the check against the Homeland Security list does not produce completely accurate results, she wrote. After the 2016 election, 34 people listed as noncitizens in both the Division of Motor Vehicles and Homeland Security databases produced evidence of citizenship, she wrote.</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cuyahoga County, Ohio board of elections is investigating</strong> why <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/09/investigation_continues_after.html">a back door to the BOE’s building was found unlocked</a> by U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich. Kucinich had showed up at the BOE only to find the office closed for early voting, but the back door unsecured. Board officials affirmed that they are sure no one could access ballots cast ahead of the Sept. 12 primary election. &#8220;We can confirm with certainty that no tampering with voted or unvoted ballots took place, nor any other action that would compromise the integrity of the&#8230; primary election,&#8221; a statement from the BOE. Ballots are stored in double-locked rooms, and those rooms were found to be locked before the close of business, the statement says. Board of Elections staff accounted for all ballots after authorities learned the building was unlocked Saturday, and no ballots were tampered with. The BOE is working with the county executive and sheriff to upgrade security procedures for the building. State Rep. Bill Patmon, who is running for mayor in Cleveland, has asked the state to <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/09/cleveland_mayoral_candidate_bi.html">investigate</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A 76-page audit by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission</strong> published in the Federal Register said that <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/politics/Federal-election-audit-questions-NH-spending-09012017">New Hampshire failed to get prior approval</a> to use $1 million in federal election money as part of a $3.7 million renovation of to the state archives building. New Hampshire received $18 million in these HAVA grants, and by the end of 2015 the state still had a $10.4 million balance. According to the <em>Union Leader</em>, state election officials said they have been trying for more than seven years to get retroactive approval of the spending.</p>
<p><strong>The U.S. Postal Service has petitioned the Postal Regulatory Commission to raise</strong> the <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/60-cents-to-mail-a-letter-maybe/">cost of a first-class postage stamp to $.60</a>. According to the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>, that’s the largest one-time increase in the Postal Service’s history. USPS claims the rate hike will help it avoid bankruptcy and improve delivery service. Needless to say, with vote-by-mail growing in popularity, and de rigueur in several states, any increase to the postal rates causes concern for elections officials. “Any government service has costs associated with them, so when the price of poll workers or postage goes up, so do the cost of running elections,” Wendy Underhill of the National Conference of State Legislatures told the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Snohomish County Auditor Carolyn Weikel announced</strong> that Tim Eyman, who has submitted a statement to the voter’s pamphlet opposing a proposed ballot measure <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/election-chief-deems-eymans-b-s-too-vulgar-for-voters-pamphlet/">may not use the term “B.S.” in his statement</a>. The B.S. in question does not stand for bachelor of science degree but well, something else. “I believe it is vulgar and inappropriate. There are many other more appropriate words in the English language that could be used to make the same point,” she told <em>Seattle Weekly</em>. Eyman insisted the phrase isn’t profane and that barring its use infringes on his free speech. Weikel said she has sought advice from the county attorney’s office about her decision. “I don’t think I’m being a prude. This is an election publication and I believe voters expect a certain level of appropriate and professional presentation of information,” she told the paper. “They expect a higher level of discussion than what Mr. Eyman has put forward.”</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> The Senate has approved a bill that would require races for county offices in San Diego County only to <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-county-elections-20170831-story.html">be determined in the November general election</a>, regardless of the results of the June primary.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> The Sedgwick County commission is working to get legislation passed in 2018 that will allow <a href="http://kmuw.org/post/sedgwick-county-commission-wants-election-audit-legislation-passed-2018">audits of election results</a>. Kansas currently does not allow for election audits other than in the case of a specific election challenge. &#8220;We would like to do random sample auditing across our county, and that would add a lot of transparency and a lot of confidence in our election process, and right now we don’t have that,&#8221; Commissioner Jim Howell told KMUW.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Gov. Paul LePage has told the Legislature that he will call them back for a special session, most likely at the end of October. One of the items up for review will be <a href="http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2017/09/01/marijuana-ranked-choice-voting-to-be-mulled-by-maine-lawmakers-in-special-session/">ranked choice voting</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> The Michigan Legislature is moving quickly on a plan that would allow political candidates in several cities to qualify for the November ballot even though they missed the filing deadline because of <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2017/09/06/house-set-clean-local-ballot/105327782/">faulty information from local clerks</a>. The House approved the proposal in a 92-13 vote. The Senate will consider the bill next week in an attempt to beat ballot printing deadlines.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> A new that allows Texas residents to <a href="http://www.reporternews.com/story/news/2017/08/31/open-carry-swords-texting-while-driving-ban-go-into-effect-texas-friday/623197001/">open carry swords</a> and knives but the law does have a few exceptions with one of those is polling places.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Virgin Islands</strong>: The Senate Committee on Rules and Judiciary <a href="http://stthomassource.com/content/2017/09/03/senate-moves-board-of-election-bills-holds-ethics-bill/">moved two elections bills</a> recently. One, Bill No. 32-0054 would grant the supervisor of election the authority to set places, days and times for early voting and the other Bill No. 32-0097 would “bar cancellation of voter registration in every instance other than death.”</p></p>

<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> Circuit Judge Robert Wyatt Jr. has ruled that the Jefferson County election commission <a href="http://www.pbcommercial.com/news/20170901/judge-to-election-commission-perform-your-duties">must perform the duties they are assigned</a> under state law and that while the commission can refuse to use the election coordinator selected by a county judge, they cannot deny that coordinator access to information needed to conduct elections, nor can they deny the coordinator access to any county property.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The Attorney General’s office has moved two legal challenges to the state’s new voter registration law <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/nh-attorney-general-moves-two-lawsuits-challenging-new-voting-law-to-federal-court/12155075">from a state court to a federal court</a>.
