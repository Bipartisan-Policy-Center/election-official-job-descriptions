							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>There’s no there there<br /></strong><em>NASS releases facts and findings on cybersecurity in 2016 electio</em> </p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>electionline.org</p>
<p>Rigged! Hacked! Tampering! Fraud!</p>
<p>Even before one vote was cast in the 2016 election, rumors swirled about the integrity of the election. The cacophony of misinformation and innuendo has not stopped since the election and all of this has caused some Americans to lose faith in the electoral system.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the election a <a href="http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/HTML%20Reports/views-on-the-american-election-process-and-perceptions-of-voter-fraud-issue-brief.aspx">survey</a> by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that only 4 in 10 Americans had a high degree of confidence that their votes would be counted correctly nearly a third of all who responded thought there was a great deal of voter fraud in the country despite the lack of evidence.</p>
<p>This week, the National Association of Secretaries of State released the <a href="http://www.nass.org/index.php/news-releases-and-statements/release-nass-briefing-cybersecurity-election16-facts-findings-mar17">State Election Officials Report Facts &amp; Findings on Cybersecurity and Foreign Targeting of the 2016 U.S. Election</a>.</p>
<p>The report is an effort by NASS to help improve voter confidence and show for a fact that the election was not “hacked”.</p>
<p>As Congress examines the impact of Russian involvement in the November 2016 election, it is important to provide the clearest and most accurate public record possible regarding election cybersecurity and foreign targeting of U.S. election infrastructure. The<a href="http://www.nass.org/index.php/news-releases-and-statements/release-nass-briefing-cybersecurity-election16-facts-findings-mar17"> following findings</a> are based on all unclassified documentation and evidence available to the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS):</p>
<p><em><strong>The November 2016 election was NOT HACKED.</strong></em><br />The voting process was not hacked or subject to manipulation in any way. No credible evidence of hacking, including attempted hacking of voting machines or vote counting, was ever presented or discovered in any state, including during recount efforts that took place after the election. A joint DHS-DNI report details the foreign cyberattacks that took place against U.S. government, political and private sector entities that were attributed to Russia.2 Election officials remain concerned by unfounded conjecture that a lack of such tangible evidence indicates that hacking might have been overlooked or hidden from discovery, despite collaborative efforts with our intelligence services, cybersecurity firms, network defenders and state and local officials.</p>
<p><em><strong>Russian intrusions into state and local election boards in 2016 were limited to TWO INCIDENTS that did not involve systems used in vote tallying.</strong></em><br />The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), along with state officials, are aware of two confirmed intrusions into government-owned voter registration databases that took place in summer 2016. The FBI has confirmed that foreign-based hackers attempted to mine data from voter registration systems in Arizona and Illinois, but no voter registration data was modified or deleted.4 In Arizona, a hacker attempted to probe voter registration data via a county-level infiltration, but was blocked from doing so by the system’s controls. In Illinois, hackers were able to access publicly-available voter files. These incidents prompted the FBI to warn state election offices to increase their election security measures for the November 2016 election.</p>
<p><em><strong>Additional state voter registration systems were targeted by cyber hackers, but NO ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS were accessed or breached.</strong></em><br />U.S. intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russian-based “cyber scanning or probing activities” were discovered against state voter registration systems, but this targeting does not equate to gaining access or actual breaches. Claims that twenty or more states experienced Russian-led hacks or intrusions into their election systems are false and inaccurate. Furthermore, while it is theoretically possible to disrupt an election via networked systems, compromising voter registration systems would not affect election results. Election registration databases are not linked to vote counting.</p>
<p><em><strong>Just OVER HALF of all states took advantage of voluntary cybersecurity assistance provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</strong></em><br />The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed to NASS that 33 states and 36 county jurisdictions had taken advantage of the agency’s voluntary assistance and services by Election Day on November 8, 2016. NASS and DHS also achieved a joint goal of ensuring that all 50 states were notified of the federal government resources that were available to them upon request. DHS services included cyber hygiene scans on Internet-facing systems, risk and vulnerability assessments and resources identifying recommendations to improve online voter registration systems, election night reporting systems and other Internet-connected systems. Those states that did not seek to utilize DHS assistance received similar or more comprehensive support from their own state networks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Our highly-decentralized, low-connectivity elections process provides BUILT-IN SAFEGUARDS against large-scale cyberattacks; however, states are strengthening their systems for future elections.</strong></em><br />Our national intelligence agencies concurred with secretaries of state in concluding that our diverse and locally–run election process presents serious obstacles to carrying out large-scale cyberattacks to disrupt elections, and that standalone, disconnected voting systems present a low risk. States are now working together to reinforce their preparedness against future cyber threats, most notably by replacing aging voting equipment. To assist in these efforts, the NASS Election Cybersecurity Task Force will advance collaboration on the unique priorities and challenges that exist regarding election cybersecurity. NASS is also supportive of a thorough accounting and resolution of documented instances of unauthorized scanning against several states’ election networks that has been attributed to IP addresses utilized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>

West Virginia Senator Jennings Randolph lead the initiative to lower the voting age. Over 29 years, Randolph introduced legislation 11 times to lower the voting age. Finally in 1971 by a 94-0 vote the Senate supported the initiative and the House followed suit with a 401-19 vote. Three-fourths of the states had ratified the amendment by July 1, 2971.</p>
<p><strong>This has just not been New Hampshire’s month</strong>. Last week towns across the state battled a blizzard and state officials over local elections and this week the town of Lisbon is <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/lisbon-officials-scramble-after-all-selectmen-resign-on-eve-of-election/9164573">scrambling to figure out how to hold its rescheduled election</a> after three members of the town’s Board of Selectmen resigned on the eve of the election. State law requires that a majority of the board be present at voting sites without the three, the town didn’t have a majority. The state allowed the town to swear in three temporary members just for Tuesday’s voting. &#8220;We met the legal requirements for the voting, and we&#8217;re voting today, which is good,” Town Moderator Robert Cook told WMUR. “So we&#8217;re feeling good about that.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Colorado Springs Clerk Sarah Johnson</strong> <strong>is reminding</strong> voters to <a href="http://gazette.com/colorado-springs-city-clerk-some-voters-dont-realize-they-need-to-unfold-their-ballots-to-vote-for-council-candidates/article/1599407">unfold their ballots</a> in order to vote for everything on it. The ballot contains three issue questions and one candidate question and some voters have called to express confusion and a few have returned the ballots without casting a vote for the candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to the Alabama Secretary of State’s office</strong> for being a winner of the National Association of State Boards of Education Award for <a href="http://www.dothanfirst.com/news/alabama-secretary-of-states-office-honored-with-award-for-mock-election/677240408">Outstanding Leadership in Voter Education</a> from The National Student/Parent Mock Election. “We’re honored to receive this award,” Secretary of State John Merrill said in a statement. “Voting is one of the most fundamental rights we receive as American citizens, and it is our duty to teach the next generation the importance of that right as early as possible. The Alabama Votes Student Mock Election provided teachers and parents with the necessary materials and opportunity to share the voting experience with their students, which will benefit them in the near future when they reach the legal voting age.”</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Reps. <a href="http://thehill.com/people/mark-pocan">Mark Pocan</a> (Wis.), Keith Ellison (Minn.) and Hank Johnson (Ga.) introduced the&nbsp;<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/324510-dem-reps-bill-would-codify-elections-as-critical-infrastructure">Securing America’s Future Elections (SAFE) Act</a>, which would launch several cybersecurity programs, including codifying the decision from former&nbsp;Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to reclassify elections as critical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> HB-2339 would <a href="http://www.mohavedailynews.com/news/legislation-would-give-counties-more-money-for-presidential-primary-elections/article_537bb9d4-0ae1-11e7-890b-7731eafbcf63.html">change the way the state reimburses the cost of holding a presidential preference elections</a>. Current law allows the state to reimburse the counties up to $1.25 per voter, but under the new legislation that reimbursement would rise to up to $3.50 per voter.</p>
<p>Also in Arizona, the Senate has <a href="http://www.dailyprogress.com/senate-republicans-ok-bill-on-initiative-signatures/article_61a5033d-8dbd-5f81-a872-e06c85528716.html">approved</a> a bill that would make it more difficult to get <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arizona/articles/2017-03-16/senate-panel-oks-bill-targeting-voter-initiatives">citizen-lead initiatives</a> onto the ballot. The bill would make it easier to challenge signatures and prohibits signature gatherers from getting paid.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> Both chambers have now approved HB 1047 that would require a voter to show a <a href="http://www.arkansasnews.com/news/20170320/lawmakers-send-voter-id-bill-to-arkansas-governor">photo ID</a> in order to vote. Gov. Asa Hutchinson is supportive of voter ID, but said he would have to review the legislation before signing it.</p>
<p>Ca<strong>l</strong>ifornia: Assemblymembers Shirley Weber (D-San Diego) and Todd Gloria (D-San Diego) have introduced a bill that would allow county boards of supervisors to change how their district boundaries are drawn and require all supervisor races to a <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-government-0317-story.html">runoff between the top-two candidates</a> in the primary.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> Senate Bill 71, which would reduce the required number of voting centers during the first week of <a href="https://durangoherald.com/articles/144735-early-voting-centers-would-be-reduced-under-gop-bill">early voting</a>, was approved upon second reading this week.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware:</strong> Under House Bill 89, the <a href="http://www.wmdt.com/news/delaware/trio-of-bills-hopes-to-increase-voter-turnout/409650833">state’s primary elections</a> would be held the same day as the presidential primary, the fourth Tuesday in April.</p>
<p><strong>District of Columbia</strong>: Councilmember Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) has introduced legislation that would <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-primary-may-move-to-june-to-avoid-breaking-federal-law/2017/03/20/d58693ee-0db2-11e7-9d5a-a83e627dc120_story.html">permanently move the city’s primary elections</a> to the third Tuesday in June. Although the 2016 primary was held in June that was only a temporary move. This legislation would make that move permanent.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Rep. Emily Slosberg (D-Boca Raton) announced her plans to file an amendment to a germane bill that would stop candidates from being inside a voter’s home while the voter is completing their <a href="http://spbc.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2017/03/20/local-representative-calls-for-vote-by-mail-laws-after-post-investigation/">vote-by-mail ballot</a>. The action follows a newspaper investigation that found candidates helping voters fill out their ballots.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> The Senate has approved a bill that would require information on voter-registration applications to <a href="http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2017-03-16/georgia-senate-backs-voter-registration-changes-opposed-rights-advocates">exactly match state or federal databases</a> in order for the voter to cast a ballot. Under the bill , people couldn’t be added to the voting rolls unless information on their application exactly matches records tied to their Georgia driver’s license or identification card or the last four digits of a Social Security Number. Without an exact match, people could only cast a provisional ballot and their application could be rejected after 26 months if they’re unable to resolve the conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Guam:</strong> Senator Joe San Agustin has introduced a bill that would <a href="http://www.pacificnewscenter.com/local/13092">do away with state-run primaries</a> and instead allow the parties to conduct their own primaries before sending those candidates to the Election Commission for the general election.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> A bill is making its way through the Senate that would create statewide <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/34939128/lawmakers-mail-in-voting-can-improve-hawaiis-low-voter-turnout">vote-by-mail</a> by 2020. The bill has already been approved by the House.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> The Senate Executive Committee has approved a new <a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2017-03-16/automatic-voter-registration-advanced-again-state-senate.html">automatic voter registration</a> bill by a 10-3 party line vote.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> The House Elections Committee has voted 8-3 to require <a href="http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/house-panel-approves-lake-precinct-consolidation-mandate/article_2157192e-b9b4-534c-934d-779afeebaa75.html">consolidation of Lake County’s numerous small precincts</a>. Under the proposed legislation, which now heads to the full House, requires county officials to create a bipartisan plan to merge as many precincts as possible that have fewer than 600 active voters.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> The House Elections Committee has approved a bill that would <a href="http://cjonline.com/news/local/2016-elections/2017-03-19/kansas-house-committee-approves-restriction-voting-site-changes">prevent county elections officials from moving the location of a polling place</a> without sending prior written notification to those affected at least 30-days in advance of the election.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Senate Bill 145, approved by the Senate and now under consideration by the House, would allow counties to place statewide, local option questions on primary or general election ballots. Counties would <a href="http://www.dailyindependent.com/news/bill-would-allow-local-option-questions-on-general-primary-ballots/article_18ea64f6-0b71-11e7-8253-8b10cc382c24.html">no longer have to hold separate special elections</a> on county-wide issues such as alcohol sales.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> A hearing was held last week on <a href="http://kwit.org/post/nebraska-bills-could-change-election-day">two election-reform bills</a>. LB619 would allow counties to hold all-mail elections and LB277 would change the maximum number of people per precinct from 1,750 to 1,000.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Senate Majority Leader Aaron Ford has introduced a bill that would allow <a href="http://www.ktnv.com/news/nevada-bills-would-restore-voting-rights-for-some-felons_93044384">nonviolent felons</a> to vote one year into their probation or parole. The bill has been approved by the Senate judicial committee.</p>
<p>Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) has vetoed legislation that would have allowed voters to be <a href="http://www.ktvn.com/story/34967744/governor-sandoval-vetoes-automatic-voter-registration-initiative">automatically registered to vote</a> when getting or renewing a driver’s license. Voters will now take up the issue as a statewide ballot measure in November 2018.</p>
<p>Assembly Bill 274 would have Nevada join the <a href="http://lasvegas.cbslocal.com/2017/03/21/nevada-moves-to-join-11-other-states-in-popular-vote-effort/">National Popular Vote</a> Interstate Compact if approved.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Following a recent blizzard and when several towns chose to postpone their elections, Democrats have <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article139806828.html">introduced a bill</a> to protect those towns from lawsuits for <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/bill-aims-legalize-town-meeting-elections-moved-noreaster#stream/0">postponing their elections</a>.</p>
<p>Also in New Hampshire, the Senate has OK’d a bill that would allow the state to hire a <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/nh-senate-oks-bill-hire-full-time-election-law-attorney#stream/0">full-time attorney to enforce state election laws</a>. That is currently done by a half-time employee.</p>
<p>By a 3-2 vote the Senate Election Law Committee has vote to send a bill to the full Senate that would <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/divided-senate-panel-narrowly-recommends-passage-for-revised-voting-reform-bill/9165528">tighten ID requirements for people who register to vote within 30 days of election</a>. Under the bill, a person who registers to vote within 30 days of an election or on Election Day must show verification that a New Hampshire address is his or her domicile.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: The Senate has approved legislation that will <a href="http://nmpolitics.net/index/2017/03/senate-oks-bill-to-consolidate-most-local-elections-let-cities-opt-out/">consolidate most local elections</a>, but it will give cities and towns the ability to opt-out.

														<p><strong>VI. Tech Thursday</strong></p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> According to <em>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, Kennesaw State University officials <a href="http://www.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/kennesaw-state-was-warned-its-server-may-vulnerable-data-breach/RGUJLEKNVx1pHWSVvfeCeN/">received a warning before the November election</a> that a server used by the election center may be vulnerable. The university did not notify the state of the potential data breach until a second hacker contacted them. A spokeswoman for Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is said to have been furious at university officials for not telling his office about the contacts before this month, said he has confidence in how the presidential election was run and that additional data checks by the office confirm the election’s results. Neither the university nor federal investigators would comment to the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> The Indian River County commission has unanimously approved the <a href="http://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/shaping-our-future/2017/03/21/indian-river-county-spend-1-million-new-voting-machines/99466618/">$1 million purchase of new voting equipment</a>.

							<h2>VIP Update</h2>
														<p><strong>VII. VIP Update</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voting Information Project seeks new home</strong><br /><em>Market analysis will help gauge interest, identify appropriate options</em></p>
<p>Last September, the <a href="http://votinginfoproject.org/news/voting-information-project-seeks-new-home/">Voting Information Project (VIP)</a><a href="http://votinginfoproject.org/news/whats-next-voting-information-project/">announced</a> that it was beginning a process to identify its next phase, as The Pew Charitable Trusts transitions away from elections work.</p>
<p>As part of that effort, VIP identified a group of stakeholders from the elections, civic tech and data, and academic communities that has been discussing how best to continue the project’s success in partnering with election officials, businesses, and organizations to deliver vital information to voters across the nation.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://votinginfoproject.org/news/where-should-voting-information-project-go-here/">January</a>, the group sought feedback from the field and was impressed by the depth and breadth of the enthusiasm for VIP and its continued work on behalf of voters.</p>
<p>Today, we wanted to share an update on where the project stands and what happens next:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stakeholders’ group is finalizing a set of principles that will lay out the future vision for the Voting Information Project, including the work to be done and the desired characteristics of a new home for the project.
</li>
<li>Those principles will be shared with the field, including on this blog, as part of a formal invitation for parties to indicate their interest in acting as the next home for VIP.
</li>
<li>Based on those responses, Pew expects to identify and transition to that new home in time for the 2018 elections.</li>
</ul>
<p>In preparation, Pew is working to identify the value of VIP to the field, both historically and going forward, by conducting a market analysis for the project’s continued operation. <a href="http://www.votinginfoproject.org/documents/4/Voting_Information_Project_RFI_2017.pdf">A Request for Information seeking firms that can conduct that analysis is available here</a>. We will keep posting updates as the selection process for VIP’s new home moves ahead. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This process has us excited about what’s next for the Voting Information Project, and we can’t wait to hear from those of you who are interested in continuing the mission of serving America’s voters.</p>
