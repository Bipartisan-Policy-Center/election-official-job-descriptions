							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stars not aligned for new Travis County, Texas voting system</strong><br /><em>County forced to scrap plans for custom voting system</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>The best laid plans of mice, men and elections officials often go awry and that’s exactly what happened to 12 years of studying and planning for <a href="https://www.traviscountytx.gov/county-clerk/elections%C2%A0">Travis County, Texas Clerk</a> Dana DeBeauvoir.</p>
<p>Long before anyone ever thought to mention Russians and elections in the same breath, Travis County began looking for a way to improve the security of the county’s voting system and provide a verifiable paper trail.</p>
<p>DeBeauvoir was upset that activists were attacking elections administrators for the design of voting systems and the purchase of DRE voting systems that did not have a paper trail.</p>
<p>“Election Administrators were and are not responsible for system design nor what can legally be purchased and used for elections, yet were being blamed for real and/or perceived deficiencies,” DeBeauvoir said.</p>
<p>So she challenged a group of computer security experts and academics to step-up and off more than misplaced criticisms. <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~dwallach/">Professor Dan Wallach, Rice University</a>, agreed and helped assemble a team of experts to design a voting system than answered the concerns. STAR Vote was born of this collaboration. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016 the county issued an RFP seeking to find a company that could build STAR-Vote (Secure, Transparent, Auditable, Reliable). In STAR-Vote the county was looking for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Source software in part to reduce high cost licensing fees charged to counties for the use of proprietary voting systems. The county wanted a GPL type of license managed by a STAR Vote Foundation to handle normal business issues regarding product certification, version control, software upgrades, implementation, financial and contract management, and other operating matters of a non-profit, election software company.
</li>
<li>A reliable voter-verified paper list of choices (Paper-LOC). This voter-verified paper trail would match the electronic ballot copy and be preserved at the polls in the ballot box for recount and other verification purposes. In this way, voters get the best of both worlds. They get the speed and accuracy of electronic voting with a paper back-up that defeats hacking and other attempts to misrepresent the correct vote tally. Voters with disabilities, get all the benefits of ADA accessible screens and tools which is also the only way to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Electronic voting interfaces also make it possible for us to enjoy Early Voting and Vote Center conveniences not available in a paper-only environment.
</li>
<li>An improved security protocol that includes encryption in the base level of the software for the purpose of supporting the ability of third parties (such as NAACP, Democratic or Republican Party, League of Women Voters, etc.) to conduct independent verification of the vote totals. No official recount is needed for this kind of post-election audit.
</li>
<li>A Take-Home receipt for the voter that does not reveal a voter’s selection. Rather it uses a hash code to let the voter, after election night, match their receipt to a database of counted ballots to assure the two codes match and establishing that the ballot was actually counted. The receipt is also useful for other post-election audits.</li>
</ol>
<p>“… [T]raditional voting systems were expensive and carried extra annual licensing costs that were growing more costly each year,” DeBeauvoirs said. “STAR Vote was an attempt at better security and an attempt to cut the growing expense for county governments.”</p>
<p>The county received 12 proposals for any, some or all of the five modules comprising STAR Vote.</p>
<p>After several months of review, the county came to the difficult realization that none of the proposals they received met their requirements for a new system.</p>
<p>DeBeauvoir, who had been optimistic that the county would be able to find a vendor said the major sticking point came down to open source voting.</p>
<p>“No vendors wanted to use this approach because they see it as a low revenue business model,” DeBeauvoir said. “Also among the 12 proposals no one bid the basic election management software (ballot definition, by mail program, and results tallying.) Think of it as a donut hole.”</p>
<p>The county will now focus on finding a “legacy” voting system that has a verified paper trail and better security. An RFP will go out later this month and the county hopes to have the new system in place within the next two to four years.</p>
<p>While disappointed that the county was not able to move forward with STAR Vote, DeBeauvoir is optimistic that someone will create such a system.</p>
<p>“I hope it will be picked up in the future by a non-profit or another county,” DeBeauvoir said. “The 2016 election was a watershed that should cause new developments in voter verified paper trails and new security programming for future voting systems. Voting system manufacturers will have to listen and respond to these latest demands.”</p>
<p>DeBeauvoir acknowledges that Travis County may have been a bit ahead of its time with STAR Vote, but she believes fallout from the 2016 election should speed up improvements to voting systems. Just recently the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/about/standards-board/">U.S. Election Assistance Standards Board</a> released <a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/TGDC_Recommended_VVSG2.0_P_Gs.pdf">Voluntary Voting System Guidelines</a> (VVSG) some of the same components that the STAR Vote system does.</p>
<p>“This is important progress,” said DeBeauvoir who serves on the Standards Board. “In a few years we will see new equipment that will have many of the features described in STAR Vote. The national attention STAR Vote received influenced these new guidelines.”</p>
<p>For other counties seeking to build their own voting system, DeBeauvoir says she would counsel patience in the marketplace. And she would also encourage equal focus on the business model for the type of company to support STAR Vote as well as the voting system design.</p>
<p>“Voters want a paper trail, one that works well,” DeBeauvoir said. “Their demands will be met sooner rather than later and that is good news in a private sector market place that has been reluctant to listen. They have their business reasons. The 2016 election changed everything in much the same way that the 2000 and 2004 elections raised the first awareness of the true needs and resources communities must have to conduct free and fair elections.”</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Secretary of State William Gardner (D) released <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/gardner-releases-documents-related-to-his-participation-on-trump-election-commission/12663418">hundreds of pages of documents</a> related to his service on the president’s Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in response to right-to-know requests from the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire and other groups and individuals. The documents include about the commission’s Sept. 12 meeting, emails commission staff laying out ethics rules for public speaking, instruction and writing while serving. There are also emails from residents expressing concerns about their data being provided to the commission.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: Secretary of State Shantel Krebs (R) sent a letter to the president’s election commission informing it that it may have access to the state’s publicly available voter registration information provided it pays the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/south-dakota/articles/2017-10-03/krebs-trump-commission-can-buy-south-dakota-voter-data">$2,500 fee</a> associated with accessing the file.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Secretary of State Rolando Pablos (R) has written a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security <a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/news/state/texas/article176241751.html">disputing the department’s allegations</a> that Russian hackers attempted to gain access to the state’s voting systems in advance of the 2016 election. “At no point were any election-related systems, software, or information compromised by malicious cyber actors,” Pablos wrote.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/dallas-county/2017/10/03/county-official-stands-behind-claim-thatrussian-hackers-targeted-dallas-elections">Dallas County</a> elections administrator Toni Pippins-Poole, who stood behind claims that the Russians had attempted to hack the county’s voting system, admitted to the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> that she misunderstood statements and reports she received from federal authorities and that hackers did not, in fact, attempt to gain access to the county’s web servers.</p>
<p>Also in Texas, Judge Tim Sulak of the Austin-based 353rd Texas Civil District Court has issued a temporary <a href="http://kut.org/post/judge-blocks-texas-secretary-state-giving-voter-information-trump-commission">restraining order</a> preventing Secretary of State Rolando Pablows form providing the presidential election commission with the state’s voter registration data.</p></p>

														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>ES&amp;S has hired risk management firm Kroll to <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-chicago-registered-voters-identity-theft-protection-met-20170928-story.html">provide fraud prevention and identity theft</a> recovery s</strong>ervices for registered voters in Chicago for a year. ES&amp;S provides the city’s poll books and in 2016 the city’s voter rolls were found posted on Amazon Web Services. According to the Chicago Tribune, while ES&amp;S maintains &#8220;investigations have not uncovered any evidence that any voter&#8217;s personal information stored on the AWS server was misused,&#8221; the firm said in a news release Thursday that it was bringing in Kroll &#8220;out of an abundance of caution.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>According to an article in AL.com, Alabama’s law that requires ex-felons to repay</strong> all outstanding court fines, legal fees and victim restitution before they may regain their right to vote, has created an underclass of thousands of people who are <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/10/too_poor_to_vote_how_alabamas.html">unable to vote because they do not have enough money</a>. Although Alabama has recently changed its law to make it easier for felons convicted of certain crimes to regain their voting rights, they still must fulfill all financial obligations. Researchers with the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard and Yale published a study earlier this year which states that “a majority of all ex-felons in Alabama, white, black or otherwise, cannot vote because they owe a debt to the state.”</p>
<p><strong>Harris County, Texas officials announced this week</strong> that as many as <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Harvey-ruined-county-polling-places-12254212.php">three dozen polling places were damaged</a> during Hurricane Harvey and may not be available for November. Harris County Clerk Stan Stanart urged voters to cast early ballots using one of the county’s 45 early voting sites. According to the Houston Chronicle, Harris County had 765 polling locations in November during the presidential election and about 5 percent might not be available for the upcoming election. Stanart also encouraged those who were eligible to vote-by-mail. With the election still a month away, Stanart was hopeful that some of the damaged polling sites would be back online. &#8220;It might be that we&#8217;re finding out they&#8217;re becoming available at the last minute,&#8221; Stanart said.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Magazine has an <a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/politics/gov-automatic-voter-registration-illinois-states.html">interesting look at automatic voter registration</a></strong> and how, as it expands nationwide, it may impact who is registered to vote. The article questions whether or not AVR may actually be more beneficial to Republicans than Democrats because there are 1.6 times as many unregistered non-Hispanic whites as there are unregistered minorities. “Not all minorities are Democrats,” Justin Leavitt, law professor at Loyola Marymount Univeristy told the magazine. “Not all Anglos are Republicans. Not all of either group would register even in an automatic registration structure. So there&#8217;s no way to know whether more of one group would register than the other.”</p>
<p><strong>Hmmmm, we’re not sure how the elections dog will feel about this one</strong>, but the Adams County, Pennsylvania board of elections voted this week to <a href="http://www.eveningsun.com/story/news/2017/10/04/adams-county-bans-animals-write-stickers-polls/731571001/">ban the presence of animals at polling places</a>. According to The Evening Sun, the ban doesn’t stem from a specific incident, but just a prohibitive county stance based on the uptick of people traveling with animals. &#8220;We&#8217;re just trying to get ahead of the curve in having some type of policy, not only in our polling places, but also in our county buildings as well,&#8221; Commissioner Randy Phiel told the paper. Service animals will be allowed at polling places as long as they have a leash or other kind of restraint. &#8220;Some people&#8217;s comfort animal is another person&#8217;s phobia,&#8221; Commissioner Marty Qually said.</p>
<p><strong>Personnel News</strong>: <strong><a href="http://ocgnews.com/dekalbs-elections-director-maxine-daniels-honored-as-she-retires/">Maxine Daniels</a></strong> is retiring as the DeKalb County Georgia director of voter registrations and elections after 16 years on the job. <strong><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/29/political-newcomer-plans-run-for-arizona-secretary/">Mark Robert Gordon</a></strong>, an elections law attorney has announced his candidacy for the Arizona secretary of state’s office. <strong><a href="http://www.wdam.com/story/36500845/forrest-county-board-of-supervisors-approves-new-election-commissioner">Gary Mordica</a></strong> has been appointed to the Forrest County, Mississippi elections commission. <strong><a href="http://www.theindependent.com/news/local/overstreet-appointed-hall-county-election-commissioner/article_dc9e6974-a879-11e7-85fa-efd802be5c5d.html">Tracy Overstreet</a></strong> has been appointed Grand Island, Nebraska election commissioner.</p></p>

<p><strong>California:</strong> Gov. Jerry Brown (D) has signed Senate Bill 511 into law. The bill requires the secretary of state’s office to make “reasonable efforts” to promote voter registration and voting in <a href="https://signalscv.com/2017/10/governor-signs-one-vetoes-one-sterns-civic-engagement-bills/">underrepresented communities</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Members of both chambers will hold a pre-session hearing on a proposal to implement <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/election/article176232091.html">ranked choice voting</a> in Kansas. According to the Kansas City Star, if lawmakers like what they hear at the hearing, they could fast-track the bill when the session begins in January.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> A bill sponsored by Rep. Melissa Sargent (D-Madison) and Eric Genrich (D-Green Bay) would spend $304,100 to pay for five additional <a href="http://urbanmilwaukee.com/2017/10/04/campaign-cash-democrats-bill-restores-election-commission-staff/">full-tie staff positions</a> for the state’s elections commission.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p>V. Legal Updates</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Lawyers for the Arizona Democratic Party argued before U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes that the state’s <a href="http://tucson.com/news/local/arizona-democratis-will-try-again-to-overturn-ballot-harvesting-ban/article_12b7ecea-2203-5263-826c-996d3eccdd5d.html">ballot harvesting law</a> was enacted illegally by the Republican-controlled Legislature.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Former Poway Mayor Don Higginson has filed a federal lawsuit challenging the <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/sd-no-cvra-challenge-20171004-story.html">California Voting Rights Act</a>. According to the <em>San Diego Union Tribune</em>, Higginson said the law is unconstitutional on its face because it requires gerrymandering based on race or ethnicity.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> In court papers filed this week, Attorney General Curtis Hill, Jr. denied allegations that a state law calling for the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/ct-ptb-voter-suppression-lawsuit-response-st-1005-20171004-story.html">consolidation of voting precincts</a> in Lake County is voter suppression. The attorney general&#8217;s 72-page response refuted the suggestion the legislation was unlawful and that it is voter suppression, according to court documents.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> At the request of the Midland County chief assistant prosecutor, charges against Grout Township Clerk Linda Birgel alleging ballot tampering, were <a href="http://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Judge-dismisses-Gladwin-ballot-tampering-case-12242680.php">dismissed without prejudice</a>. Birgel was charged with felony disclosing and obstructing votes and absentee ballot tampering. She was also charged with a misdemeanor of failure to perform duties.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> A suit has been filed against the state of Mississippi seeking overturn a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawsuit-seeks-end-mississippis-lifetime-felon-voting-ban-50161011">life time voting ban for some ex-felons</a>. Some of the crimes on the list include embezzlement, forgery, bribery, burglary, theft, arson, perjury, bigamy and obtaining money or property through false pretense. According to ABC News, the suit notes that the same constitution adopted restrictive poll taxes, literacy requirements and residency requirements to disenfranchise people. Most of those have been struck down, removed or weakened over the ensuing 125 years.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Judge Kevin Castel has upheld a ban on <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/09/28/judge-rules-to-uphold-selfie-ban-in-nyc-voting-booths/">ballot selfies</a>. In his ruling he said he agrees with elections officials from the state and city who argued that photographs risk slowing the voting process and being used as evidence in voter intimidation schemes.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: A group of petitioners have filed paperwork in the First Judicial District Court seeking to have the court force the city of Santa Fe to implement <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/ranked-choice-petition-heads-to-district-court/article_b5a87f45-379c-5063-853b-0a7486dfad4f.html">ranked choice voting</a> which was approved by voters in 2008.</p>
