<p><strong>You’ve got mail!</strong><br /><em>Electionmail: Be part of the solution!</em></p>
<p>By Tammy Patrick<br /><a href="http://bipartisanpolicy.org/">Bipartisan Policy Center</a></p>
<p>2016 saw more voters using the United States Postal Service to either receive their ballot, return their ballot, or both, than in any other election cycle.</p>
<p>The establishment of <a href="http://www.electionmail.org">www.electionmail.org</a> helped to identify some common issues that we will continue to work on in 2017 and beyond — and you can help!</p>
<p>USPS will be revisiting electionmail specifications and is seeking information on envelope designs and requirements to inform this decision-making process. Please consider these 5 easy actions:</p>
<p>1. <strong>AUTOMATION COMPATIBILITY</strong>: USPS needs samples to run through automation testing to see how they react with flexibility, sizes, etc. (A sort of L&amp;A on their equipment if you will.)</p>
<p>Send 10 examples of ballot packets (outbound with the return materials included, just like you would if you were sending it to a voter) along with documentation that it was approved by a USPS Mailpiece Design Specialist (if applicable) to:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">US Postal Service<br />Attn: Election Mail Program Manager<br />PO Box 23282<br />Washington, DC 20026-3282</p>
<p>2. <strong>DESIGN STANDARDS</strong>: Send your statutory requirement citations for return ballot content (voter signature, affidavit, etc.) to: <a href="mailto:electionmailprogrammanager@usps.com">electionmailprogrammanager@usps.com</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <strong>COMMUNICATION:</strong> Send contact for your mail vendor to possibly be contacted by USPS to discuss ways to improve their services to you: <a href="mailto:electionmailprogrammanager@usps.com">electionmailprogrammanager@usps.com</a></p>
<p>4. <strong>ELECTIONMAIL.ORG</strong>: Did you use <a href="http://www.electionmail.org">www.electionmail.org</a> to report a problem? If so, please complete our survey located on the site so we can improve the service.</p>
<p>5. <strong>COMING SOON!! MAIL CLASS &amp; BALLOT SERVICE TYPE ID (STID)</strong>: the exciting news is that USPS is creating a STID for ballots!! Now we need to understand what class of service you’re using to ensure a STID is created for that class. Be on the lookout in the next few weeks for a survey, or send your information (including the type of return mail-service) to: <a href="mailto:electionmailprogrammanager@usps.com">electionmailprogrammanager@usps.com</a></p>
<p>If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to contact Tammy Patrick at <a href="mailto:tpatrick@bipartisanpolicy.org">tpatrick@bipartisanpolicy.org</a> or Dan Bentley at <a href="mailto:electionmailprogrammanager@usps.com">electionmailprogrammanager@usps.com</a>.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft is at odds</strong> with Gov. Eric Greitens over how much it should <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/ashcroft-says-governor-s-offer-isn-t-enough-money-for/article_e0c34e0d-a1ac-5481-8d94-644f5900acd2.html">cost to implement the state’s new voter ID law</a>. Greitens included $300,000 for implementation in the budget which would include $100,000 for advertising, paying for free IDs and covering the cost of getting personal records for those IDs. Ashcroft estimated that will cost between $1.1 million and $1.5 million to accomplish an effective roll out before the August elections. &#8220;We would suggest that we would need more to do the best job we can,&#8221; Ashcroft told the St. Louis Dispatch.</p>
<p><strong>Residents of Anchorage, Alaska are going to have a </strong><a href="http://www.ktva.com/april-election-will-not-anchorages-first-vote-mail-election-planned-461/"><strong>wait</strong> just a bit longer for their first all-mail election</a>. Although the Anchorage Assembly approved legislation to move to vote-by-mail beginning in 2017, local elections officials said they still need new equipment in order to make that possible. “We recognized that this was a really challenging, big project and we anticipated that we might have setbacks along the way,” Deputy municipal clerk Amanda Moser told KTVA. “And so although we were really cautiously optimistic that we’d be able to go forward with an April 2017 vote by mail election, we are excited to move forward after that with vote by mail and we just really want to make sure that we have everything in place to have a successful election.”</p>
<p><strong>Vermont has been forced to </strong><a href="http://digital.vpr.net/post/state-process-fixing-error-caused-ineligible-voters-be-registered#stream/0"><strong>pause the roll out</strong> of automatic voter registration</a> after problems with the implementation lead to some ineligible residents being added to the voter rolls. A release from Secretary of State Jim Condos’ office said the Department of Motor Vehicles shared more data than it was supposed to with elections officials during the first 18 days of the roll out. “We immediately pulled the plug and froze the system so that it would not accept any more, and then at the same time we canceled any pending registrations until we could clear this up,” Condos told Vermont Public Radio.</p>
<p><strong>Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly</strong> indicated this week that the administration will leave the <a href="http://www.thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/318320-trump-official-election-infrastructure-should-be-protected">“critical” designation for the nation’s election infrastructure</a>. “I believe we should help all of the states to make sure their systems are protected, so I would argue we should keep that in place,” Secretary John Kelly said during testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee in response to questioning from Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.).</p>
<p><strong>Former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander</strong> has been joined by four members of former President Barack Obama’s staff to create a new national organization called <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article131230169.html">Let America Vote</a>. According to the Kansas City Star, Kander’s new group filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday. Kander told the paper that new laws meant to restrict voting have cropped up at state legislatures around the country since the election and that his organization “will be there to expose the motivations of those efforts.”</p>
<p><strong>A new elections political action committee c</strong>alled <a href="https://www.equalityrules.org/">Equality Rules</a> also launched recently. The nonpartisan PAC is dedicated to protecting voting rights and will support candidates and legislation across the country that advance equal voting rights &#8212; and oppose those who don’t.</p>
<p><strong>Another county elections department has gotten the <a href="http://www.sanbenitocountytoday.com/news/local_politics/san-benito-plays-role-in-scandal-tv-episode-on-tight/article_ea18d6fa-ee2c-11e6-bf22-a315436152d0.html">“Scandal” treatment</a>.</strong> Back in 2012 Defiance County, Ohio was at the center of a voter fraud storyline on the popular ABC drama and this year it’s San Benito County, California, although this time there’s no voting scandal. In the episode, San Benito is the swing county in the now swing state of California. “In the first eight minutes of the first show of the season, we were mentioned 10 times,” said Assistant County Clerk-Recorder-Registrar of Voters Angela Curro told the Free Lance. The county elections department tweeted out a news release related to the show, reminding residents that it’s fictional. “This just goes to show you that even in a fictional TV show that anybody, any little county, could be the one to make the difference,” Curro told the paper. “Get out there and make a difference. Every vote counts.”</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: The House Administration Committee voted 6-3 in support of a bill from Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) that would eliminate the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/07/house-panel-votes-close-election-assistance-commission/97603326/">United States Election Assistance Commission</a>.</p>
<p>The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has forwarded bipartisan legislation that would <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/07/house-panel-displays-bipartisan-unity-over-bill-to-save-postal-service-from-financial-ruin/?utm_term=.61250e868aaf">save the U.S. Postal Service</a> from financial ruin. While much of the bill centers around internal cost savings and procedures, the bill would not eliminate Saturday delivery, would raise the of a stamp one-cent and would allow for cluster box delivery for homes where 40 percent of the residents agree.</p>
<p><strong>Alaska:</strong> House Bill 7, sponsored by State Rep. Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins (D-Sitka) would make posting <a href="http://www.ktoo.org/2017/02/02/lawmakers-consider-protecting-ballot-selfies-as-part-of-free-speech/">ballot selfies</a> legal in Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> Republicans have filed Senate Joint Resolution 6 which would refer a constitutional amendment to the voters that if approved would require voters to show a <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/feb/03/filing-would-put-voter-id-amendment-bef-1/?f=news-arkansas">photo ID</a> in order to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Under HB 409, election supervisors would be required to <a href="http://www.mynews13.com/content/news/cfnews13/news/article.html/content/news/articles/cfn/2017/2/2/florida_democrats_ba.html">send text messages to voters</a> on the first day of early voting as well as on Election Day. The messages will alert voters to polling hours and locations.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> The full House approved House Bill 373, which would authorize <a href="http://www.dailyprogress.com/proposed-updates-to-election-laws-ok-d-in-mississippi-house/article_23610cd2-981f-553b-aead-bb18cec4228a.html">online voter registration</a> for those with a valid driver’s license. The House also approved House Bill 1054 to create a group to study a system to restore voting rights for people convicted of nonviolent felonies.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> According to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, top Republican leaders asked state Rep. Geraldine Custer not to introduce a bill to make the coming special election by <a href="http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/politics/republican-leaders-oppose-cheaper-mail-ballot-election-to-replace-zinke/article_062a03c7-1562-5ae4-a5d3-601474f9b2c0.html">mail ballot only</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Three senators have joined forces to introduce Senate Bill 100 which would require county clerks to establish a system whereby voters could choose to make showing their <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/republicans-look-revive-gun-voter-id-bills-2017-nevada">photo ID</a> a requirement before voting. Voters could opt in or out of the system.</p>
<p>Also in Nevada, Assembly Bill 45 would add requirements to <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/local/nevada/nevada-assembly-bill-would-address-potential-voter-registration-fraud">groups involved in voter registration</a> and petition drives such allowing the secretary of state’s office to adopt regulations that determine qualifications for these groups such as training.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Attorney General Eric Schniderman has introduced the <a href="http://www.amny.com/news/elections/new-york-votes-act-proposed-by-ag-schneiderman-aims-to-simplify-democratic-process-1.13082041">New York Votes Act</a> which includes provisions for automatic voter registration, same day registration and early voting in the Empire State. “Any law that makes it easier to vote is a good law; any law that makes it harder to vote is a bad law,” Schneiderman said in a statement. “New York has long been a bastion of democracy, but our state’s current system of registration and voting is an affront to that legacy.”</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: By a 74-16 vote, the House approved legislation that would require voters to show a <a href="http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/voter-id-bill-easily-passes-north-dakota-house/article_5e6b48dc-385e-5955-a353-58460a7b489f.html">photo ID</a> in order to cast a ballot. The new legislation would do away with the affidavit option that had been available during previous elections.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> Secretary of State Dennis Richardson (R) is proposing that the secretary of state’s office <a href="http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/344046-224210-secretary-of-state-wants-to-make-office-nonpartisan">become a nonpartisan position</a>. Although legislation has yet to be introduced, Richardson met with legislators this week and said making the secretary of state’s office nonpartisan would boost confidence in the office.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> A House committee has approved HB230 which would require counties to <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865672939/House-committee-OKs-bill-requiring-paid-postage-for-by-mail-ballots.html">pay return postage</a> on absentee ballots when conducting a vote-by-mail election.</p>
<p>Also in committee, lawmakers have decided to delay making any decisions on a proposed <a href="http://kutv.com/news/local/utah-lawmaker-pushes-for-automatic-voter-registration">automatic voter registration bill</a>.</p>
<p>The House Government Operations Committee also approved a bill that would create a <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/home/4919902-155/election-headaches-lead-utah-lawmakers-to">statewide presidential primary</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> The General Assembly is considering <a href="http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/three-bills-arise-from-lynchburg-ballot-shortage-registrars-to-retain/article_0e065eb6-e9af-11e6-84ca-b313ba4e130d.html">three bills directly related to the special election in Lynchburg earlier this year</a>. SB 1552 and HB 2415 would only order registrars to use historical data, including voter turnout, to make that decision, information many registrars have said they generally consider. In addition, SB 1571,&nbsp;sponsored by Peake,&nbsp;would order electoral boards to meet regardless of any federal holiday. The bill also would require local electoral boards to certify special elections before counting provisional ballots unless the total of outstanding provisional ballots would not change who wins.</p>
<p>The Senate has narrowly approved a constitutional amendment that would <a href="http://wtop.com/virginia/2017/02/va-senate-passes-constitutional-amendment-felon-voting-rights/">change how and whether ex-felons get their voting rights restored</a>. The amendment would retain Virginia’s rule that those convicted of felonies&nbsp;lose their voting rights, but would require governors to set up a process to automatically restore the rights of nonviolent felons when they have completed their sentences, including payment of all fines, fees or restitution and serving of any time on probation or parole.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> House Bill 1342 would allow all Washington voters, not just military and overseas voters, to <a href="http://kuow.org/post/opponents-e-voting-washington-state-call-proposed-bill-dangerous">return their cast ballots via email</a> to county auditors’ offices. Secretary of State Kim Wyman as well as the state’s Association of Auditors testified against the legislation.</p></p>

														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Maine’s Supreme Judicial Court has agreed to review a set of questions regarding the legality of <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2017/02/07/maines-high-court-will-hear-case-on-ranked-choice-voting-law/">ranked-choice voting</a> which was approved by the voters in November 2016. According to the Portland Press Herald, the court indicated it would take the matter up and invited the Legislature, the state’s Attorney General, the Governor’s office and the Secretary of State to all submit written arguments on the new law.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: The New Mexico Supreme Court <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/state-supreme-court-upholds-closed-primaries/article_fd6e50e2-0aaf-5c94-81a9-c32f2e8f8041.html">upheld the state’s system of closed primary elections</a>, ruling the practice is constitutional and not overly burdensome. The decision means primary elections can continue to be closed to voters who aren’t registered as members of the political parties with candidates on the ballot and unaffiliated voters will only be able to vote in general elections.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Essex County will appeal a ruling by State Supreme Court Justice Martin Auffredou that ordered the county to <a href="http://www.suncommunitynews.com/articles/the-sun/county-appeals-state-supreme-court-election-ballot-ruling/">release electronic ballot scans</a> and cast vote records.</p>

Deputy Jason Vetter faces a fine of $75 for violating OR S 260.432 &#8220;by engaging in political advocacy while on the job during work hours as a public employee.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Circuit-court-panel-upholds-Pasadena-voting-10906957.php">unanimously upheld a lower court’s ruling</a> that the city of Pasadena’s May election will proceed as planned using a 2011 system.</p></p>
