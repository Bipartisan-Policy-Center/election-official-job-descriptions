							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>Impact data shows who votes with automatic voter registration</strong></p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/about/staff/kennedy-liz/bio/">Liz Kennedy</a> and <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/about/staff/griffin-rob/bio/">Rob Griffin<br /></a><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/">Center for American Progress</a></p>
<p>Automatic Voter Registration is a necessary, common sense reform whose time has come. Since Oregon adopted it in 2015 and implemented it in 2016 several other states have moved to modernize their systems with automatic voter registration (AVR).</p>
<p><span class="wf_caption" style="max-width: 334px; margin: 7px; float: left; display: inherit;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AVR_Video.jpg" alt="AVR Video" width="334" height="187" style="border: 1px none #000000; margin: auto;" /><span>The Center for American Progress created this automatice voter registration primer video. <br /><a href="https://youtu.be/gwLyY7bMcrI">Click here to watch the video</a>. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>AVR strengthens democracy by expanding the electorate. AVR’s streamlined systems can save states and localities significant costs, make the voter registration lists more accurate and up to date, and increase the security of the voting system. AVR is the next logical step in creating an efficient, secure, and modern voter registration system for the 21st century.</p>
<p>Oregon provides strong evidence in favor of automatic voter registration. We recently released a <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2017/06/07/433677/votes-automatic-voter-registration/">new report</a> from the Center for American Progress providing a demographic and geographic portrait of how Oregon’s Automatic Voter Registration system has worked to register hundreds of thousands of eligible citizens to vote.&nbsp;This is the first time the question is being answered about which populations actually used AVR and if the program is working to expand the electorate. The answer is a resounding yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong><br />What is so special about AVR? AVR transforms the voter registration paradigm.&nbsp;Traditionally the voter registration process has put the full burden on the individual to get themselves registered to vote and keep their registration updated every time they move if they wanted to be able to cast a vote and have their voices heard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Oregon’s AVR system, eligible citizens are automatically registered to vote through records collected by the Office of Motor Vehicles. All the information necessary to determine voting eligibility for general elections is already required by the agency in its applications for driver’s licenses, learner’s permits, and identification cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The AVR Effect</strong><br />In less than a year, AVR registered over 270,000 new registrations, and more than 98,000 of them voted in the 2016 election.&nbsp;We also wanted to know how many of those 270,000 are people who probably wouldn’t have registered themselves. Using a number of data points, we estimated that about 116,000 people were registered who were unlikely to have registered themselves. Of those, over 40,000 voted. By election day, OMV registrants made up 8.7 percent of people registered to vote and constituted 4.7 percent of all voters in Oregon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oregon’s electorate is now more representative of the state’s population since citizens registered through OMV are younger, more rural, lower-income, and more ethnically diverse. For example, 40 percent of AVR registrants were 18-29 years old compared to just 18 percent of those registered through traditional means; 18-29 year olds make up 20 percent of Oregon’s population. Compared with traditional registrants and voters, AVR registrants and voters were more likely to live in: areas that are suburban; in low- and middle-income areas, in lower-education areas, and in racially diverse areas.</p>
<p>While turnout was up across the country in the 2016 election cycle, Oregon experienced the&nbsp;largest surge of any state—a 4.1 point increase compared with 2012. It is reasonable to say that AVR played a large part in that increase.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Going Forward</strong><br />Several states have adopted AVR programs since Oregon and are on their way to implementation, including California; Alaskans adopted AVR last year at the ballot box. Just last month there was a unanimous, bi-partisan support in both houses in Illinois to adopt AVR, and the bill awaits the governor’s signature. In Rhode Island the AVR bill recently passed the House unanimously.&nbsp;Federal AVR legislation has also been introduced.</p>
<p>Evidence shows that AVR broadens the electorate and increases voter participation while leading to a more efficient, streamlined, and secure voter registration system. Americans deserve the convenience of automatic voter registration without delay.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Despite a report saying the county would save more than $10 million</strong> by adopting a new <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/2017/06/13/orange-county-supervisors-reject-new-cost-saving-voting-system/">mail-ballot/vote center voting system</a>, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted down the proposal citing concerns about increased voter fraud. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla told the <em>Orange County Register</em> he was “surprised … shocked and deeply disappointed” by Orange County’s decision. Supervisors directed Registrar Neal Kelley—who supported the switch to the new system—to provide them with a proposal to replace the voting machines in all of the county’s 1,000 polling places. The paper said that could cost as much as $40 million.</p>
<p><strong>Caledonia, Mississippi is <a href="http://www.cdispatch.com/news/article.asp?aid=58694">taking a mulligan on its recent mayoral and alderman elections</a> </strong>after the election commission voted 4-0 to toss the results of the election when questions arose about the handling of ballot boxes. One election commissioner allegedly took home a ballot box that was not properly sealed. That election commissioner — Ken Byars — has since resigned. “I&#8217;m good with that,&#8221; Byars told the <em>Commercial Dispatch</em>. &#8220;I know that I didn&#8217;t do anything intentionally wrong. To tell you the truth, we didn&#8217;t even know we had the seals and I didn&#8217;t know there was anything wrong with taking the ballot box with me. I had to take it somewhere when we left at midnight Tuesday. I put it in my locked truck and the box was padlocked and I had the key. In the past, we never had a situation where the election carried over until the next day. I regret what happened. It wasn&#8217;t intentional.&#8221; The new election is scheduled for July 18, but now there is a <a href="http://www.cdispatch.com/news/article.asp?aid=58789">new wrinkle</a>. One member of the election commission is the aunt of one of the candidates and that commissioner has chosen to resign so unless one of the three remaining election commissioners is able to get off of work, there will not be enough election commissioners to legally conduct the election.</p>
<p><strong>One Illinois school district is on a mission to eliminate</strong> county elections officials from <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-nvs-204-voters-in-schools-st-0614-20170612-story.html">using schools as polling places</a>. The Indian Prairie District 204 School Board wants the counties to pay for the security the schools require on election day — about $10,000 each election day. The board agreed to charge the counties the money and then leave it up to elections officials whether or not they wanted to pay for the security and therefore be able to use their buildings.</p>
<p><strong>On the move:</strong> Several elections offices are making moves this week. In <a href="http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20170614/NEWS/170619897">Monterey County, California</a>’s elections office is moving to a new, bigger facility. The new facility is 20,000 square feet, while the old space was 14,000 square feet. The <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/allwcm/article/New-home-for-Schenectady-County-Board-of-11220205.php">Schenectady County, New York</a> board of elections is moving into the county’s unified communications center to avoid problems with flooding that the BOE experienced in the past. And in Ohio, the <a href="http://www.zanesvilletimesrecorder.com/story/news/2017/06/14/county-purchases-building-relocate-board-elections/390419001/">Muskingum County</a> board of elections is moving to a new 6,500-square-foot building that also includes a 6,000-square-foot warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to the <a href="http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/jackson-county-board-of-elections-turns-100">Jackson County, Missouri Board of Elections</a></strong> that on June 18th will celebrate its 100th year. The BOE is hosting a centennial celebration with a century’s worth of elections memorabilia on display. Director Tammy Brown told KSHB that she hopes the celebration will encourage people to participate in the process. “It’s amazing what people went through for the right to vote. Minorities, women, I mean there’s so much history out there,&#8221; Brown told the station. &#8220;People have fought for this right and it gets really depressing when you see election results coming in at fifteen percent.”</p>
<p><strong>Personnel News</strong>: <strong><a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article155146829.html">Kelly Arnold</a></strong>, Sedgwick County, Kansas clerk is considering a run for secretary of state.

She was 84. Bensman spent her career at the board of elections, where she had a reputation as an efficient and well-organized supervisor whose petite frame belied a strong will, co-workers said. In the late 1980s, she oversaw the board’s transition to a digital system for verifying petition signatures. “Marilyn was always a pleasant person, always happy, but she was always worrying about the election,” Gary Byers, a municipal judge who worked with her at the board of elections told <em>The Toledo Blade</em>. “She always worried about getting it right. She would check and re-check and double check again. She was the kind of person you’d want overseeing elections.”</p></p>
