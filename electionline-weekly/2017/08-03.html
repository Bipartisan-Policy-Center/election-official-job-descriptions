							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>Exit Interview: John Lindback<br /></strong><em>From Alaska to Oregon to the private sector, Lindback has seen a lot</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>Electionline.org</p>
<p>June 2017 saw the exit of some very large names in the election administration field. We profiled Michigan’s <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2017/2233-electionlineweekly-june-29-2017">Christopher Thomas</a>, Boone County Clerk <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2017/2224-electionlineweekly-june-22-2017">Wendy Noren</a> and Verfied Voting’s <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2017/2237-electionlineweekly-july-6-2017">Pam Smith</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lindback1.jpg" alt="Lindback1" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px none #000000; float: left;" width="254" height="254" />One other “giant” in the elections world also retired in June and that was John Lindback. John was the first executive director of <a href="http://www.ericstates.org/">ERIC</a>. He also was a senior officer for <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/election-initiatives">Elections Initiatives at The Pew Charitable Trusts</a> where he worked as the lead on Pew’s work to upgrade voter registration.</p>
<p>He served as director of elections in the <a href="http://sos.oregon.gov/Pages/index.aspx">Oregon secretary of state’s office</a> for eight years and was the chief of staff for the Alaska lieutenant governor which included six years with administrative oversight of the <a href="http://www.elections.alaska.gov/">Alaska Division of Elections</a>.</p>
<p>John was president of the <a href="https://www.nased.org/">National Association of State Elections Directors</a> in 2008 and he also served on the executive board of the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s</a> Standards Advisory Board.</p>
<p>John has seen a lot during his tenure in the world of elections administration and has seen it from both sides of the spectrum—the day-to-day work and the advocacy side, which is why we did not want to miss the opportunity to sit down with him (so-to-speak) for one of our exit interviews.</p>
<p><em>You are leaving the field at an interesting time, to say the least, why now?</em></p>
<p>A year ago I decided that I didn’t want to work full-time anymore. My wife and I would like to travel the world for up to three months a year if we can afford it. It’s time to start living that dream.</p>
<p><em>In your career you’ve had the opportunity to work day-to-day in elections as well as on the advocacy side, did you prefer one over the other and if so, why? [I know, it&#8217;s like choosing a favorite child, but every parent has one!]</em></p>
<p>I can’t say I liked one more than the other. I can say, though, that I was very glad I had served as an administrator of elections before I went to work for the Pew Charitable Trusts.</p>
<p>Elections administrators frequently work with charitable foundations, civic tech groups, academics, and advocacy organizations on improving US elections. Administrators tend to trust advocates who have a background in running elections. It’s offensive when advocates and academics who don’t know the difference between a spoiled ballot and a provisional ballot or the difference between active and inactive voters walk in the door and start telling seasoned administrators how to do their jobs.</p>
<p><em>Is there anything you wished you had accomplished while working in elections that you weren’t able to?</em></p>
<p>Yes, about a thousand things. There are too many to mention. But I worked hard every day to make progress. Making changes in how elections are conducted takes extreme patience and tons of time. Nothing happens quickly because most worthwhile changes require legislative action and requests for more money. Partisan politics can get in the way. I just kept my head down and kept plugging away. I got as far as I could.</p>
<p><em>Talk to us about duct tape. We understand it&#8217;s played a key role in your career.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Lindback2.jpg" alt="Lindback2" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px none #000000; float: right;" width="241" height="241" /></em></p>
<p>I’ve been looking forward to the day when I don’t have to worry that what I say could threaten my job. The day is here.</p>
<p>Elections administrators in this country for far too long have held together aging elections systems and voter registration systems with the proverbial duct tape and paper clips. It’s ridiculous that state legislatures and county commissioners have strangled elections budgets to the point where the foundation of our Democracy is threatened.</p>
<p>In my home state of Oregon, the University of Oregon athletic department is swimming in money and palatial facilities. Yet counties can’t afford to replace aging voting equipment.</p>
<p>It’s time for elections officials to shed the “I’ll keep it together with duct tape” mentality and the fear of speaking out. Elections officials, and those of us who support them, all must demand that appropriators make elections a priority rather than an afterthought.</p>
<p><em>In an increasingly partisan world, what advice would you give to up-and-coming elections officials to deal with that?</em></p>
<p>When I stepped into the world of elections administration I thought it was important to put away my “partisan past” and stay out of political activities. The public and political campaigns, including the political parties, expect elections administrators to run elections on a level playing field. I stopped affiliating with a political party. I avoided all political activities. I don’t put bumper stickers on my car. I don’t tell my friends how to vote on Facebook. I just tell them to vote. My family and close friends know my political leanings. But that’s it. It worked well for me. I encourage up-and-coming elections officials to do the same.</p>
<p><em>What do you feel was your greatest accomplishment and why?</em></p>
<p>Personally: Serving as a strong role model to three sons.</p>
<p>Professionally: Expanding <a href="http://www.ericstates.org/">ERIC</a> to 20 states and the District of Columbia and getting it up as a fully functioning, efficient organization. It was the hardest job I’ve ever done and the most rewarding job of my life. And I’ve had some great jobs.</p>
<p><em>If you could create the perfect elections system, what would it look like?</em></p>
<p>I’m not sure what the perfect elections system looks like. But if I could wave a magic wand and change things I’d make the following happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Require all states and territories to participate in ERIC.</li>
<li>Implement automatic voter registration in all 50 states and the territories.</li>
<li>Provide adequate funding for resources and first-rate training of elections officials on how to keep their voting systems and voter registration databases secure.</li>
<li>Make the federal government pay its share of expenses for federal elections.</li>
<li>Prohibit Secretaries of State and Lt. Governors from running for another office at the same time as they have jurisdiction over elections in their state.</li>
<li>Require all states to give access to international observers for federal general elections.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What will you miss most about working in the elections field?</em></p>
<p>I’ll miss that sense that what I’m doing every day is important to American Democracy. And I’ll miss talking every day to all the wonderful friends I’ve made in the elections community. Doug Lewis tells me I can join him and Chris Thomas and others in the Has Been Club. Gladly.</p>
<p><em>What’s next for you, after your fabulous Scandinavian excursion that is?</em></p>
<p>I’m looking forward to a life where I get to travel every year and then come and work on small elections projects. I’d like to work on short-term projects that have a clear goal. If I can work part-time and still make a difference I’ll be a happy man.</p>

							<h2>Federal/State Update</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Update</strong></p>
<p>Late last week, the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity issued a new letter to all 50 states and the District seeking the voting data of every registered voter.</p>
<p>In the letter, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), who is vice chair of the commission, emphasized the importance of privacy of the voter data.</p>
<p>“Individuals’ voter registration records will be kept confidential and secure throughout the duration of the commission’s existence,” Kobach <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/07/27/trumps-voting-commission-again-asks-states-for-voter-data-vows-to-protect-records/?utm_term=.df832fc05c6a">wrote</a> in the letters to state officials. “Once the commission’s analysis is complete, the commission will dispose of the data as permitted by federal law.”</p>
<p>In the letter, Kobach also said that the only information the commission would make public are “statistical conclusions drawn from the data” and other general observations.</p>
<p>States have responded to the new request in a <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article165048297.html">variety of ways</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, several states have said they will not be providing the election commission with the information they have requested. Those states include: <a href="http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/section/6/article/124583/">Kentucky</a>, <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2017/07/31/maines-secretary-of-state-says-he-will-reject-second-request-for-voter-registration-data/">Maine</a>, <a href="http://nmpoliticalreport.com/356806/nm-sos-shoots-down-second-info-request-from-trump-voter-commission/">New Mexico</a>, and <a href="http://www.phillyvoice.com/wolf-writes-shares-another-rejection-letter-trumps-voter-fraud-commission/">Pennsylvania</a>.</p>
<p>Several states have already forwarded their information including <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jul/29/arkansas-resubmits-voter-data-to-prober-1/">Arkansas</a>, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2017/07/31/colorado-secretary-of-state-trump-election-integrity-commission-voting/">Colorado</a> , <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-florida-voter-data-trump-commission-20170731-story.html">Florida</a> and <a href="http://buffalonews.com/2017/08/02/information-new-york-voters-shared-federal-panel/">New York</a>.</p>
<p>Two states have told the commission they can have the requested information as long as they pay for it. <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/wisconsin/articles/2017-07-28/wisconsin-elections-commission-responds-to-trump-commission">Wisconsin</a> is seeking $12,500 and <a href="http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2017/08/01/2-500-check-trump-could-get-s-d-voting-list/497935001/">South Dakota</a> is seeking $2,500.</p>
<p>This week, U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/us-judge-denies-common-cause-effort-to-block-trump-voter-commission/2017/08/01/57abf36c-76d3-11e7-9eac-d56bd5568db8_story.html?utm_term=.628a581265d4">denied an emergency motion by Common Cause</a> to stop the collection of data. The suit alleged that the request for certain data—voting history and party affiliation—violates a law that prohibits the government from gathering information about how Americans exercise their first amendment rights.</p>
<p>Also this week, Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Dianne Feinstein (D-California) and Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) have written a letter to the White House counsel asking whether the Trump Administration will pay for or <a href="http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/national-govt--politics/brown-trump-should-buy-protection-for-voters-after-info-released/l7FQscdZVeZIlzH5OpNRbJ/">provide credit monitoring services</a> for the citizens whose personal information was divulged when the White House released 112 pages of emails about the election commission.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho:</strong> The Idaho Democratic Party has said that it <a href="http://www.localnews8.com/news/politics/idaho-democrats-wont-challenge-new-request-for-voter-data/597327522">will not sue the state</a> in order to stop the release of voter data. The party had sued Secretary of State Lawerence Denney following the first request for data seeking to keep the information private.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: A <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/Trump_voter_fraud_commission_renews_voter_data_request">legal challenge</a> brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire against Secretary of State Bill Gardner to stop the release of the state’s voter data to the presidential commission will have an August 7 hearing.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> Oregon Secretary of State Dennis Richards has issued a revised, <a href="http://www.ktvz.com/news/oregon-secretary-of-state-limits-voter-rolls-info-disclosure/594377224">more limited policy on public disclosure of information from voter rolls</a>. Under the new policy, the secretary of state’s office will not release voters’ dates of birth or phone number, something the office had previously done. “The Legislature has enacted laws that require statewide voter lists to be publicly available, and this serves the critical public policy interest of ensuring transparency and accountability in the conduct of elections,” Richardson said in a statement. “I encourage the Legislature to comprehensively review the statutes governing publicly available voter information in the 2018 session; this new private information policy will serve as a stopgap until the legislature decides to update the law.”</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> On behalf of groups of concerned voters, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Utah (LULAC) and the League of Women Voters of Utah (LWV) have filed suit against Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox in an effort to <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/home/5556428-155/group-sues-to-block-release-of">prevent the release of voter data to the election commission</a>. According to the Salt Lake Tribune, the lawsuit argues that if the database were made public, the elections chief would be unable to guarantee that the information would be used legally because someone could request the information directly from the commission rather than from the state. Therefore, private firms could use the information however they saw fit, the lawsuit states.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> The State of Washington has responded to the <a href="http://klcc.org/post/washington-state-tells-doj-voter-rolls-are-accurate">U.S. Department of Justice’s inquiry</a> as to how the state purges the rolls of “ineligible voters”. In her four-page response to the DOJ, Director of Elections Lori Augino says the state routinely compares its voter registration database to lists of deaths and felony convictions. And the state looks for duplicates every night. Augino said the bottom line is Washington has “an outstanding and consistent track record of maintaining an accurate list of registered voters while simultaneously ensuring that valid voters are not improperly purged from this list.”</p></p>

														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Virginia Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission has approved</strong> a resolution instructing its staff to <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/state-auditors-to-review-virginia-elections-agency-after-it-troubles/article_d1af6f9a-0dd1-554b-93ca-a08677ed0b5b.html">conduct an review of the state’s board of elections</a> after several technical issues raised questions about the reliability of the SBOE’s software. According to the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em>, Sen. Mark D. Obershain (R-Rockingham) requested the audit as a way to find out if the existing system can be fixed with more money or if it’s “fundamentally broken.” Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortés told the paper his agency is already working to improve performance by adding server capacity and making other tweaks after gaining the ability to modify the system’s code in-house. The last audit was conducted about 20 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas conducted municipal elections this week</strong> and turnout was low in many places. Some are attributing that to the fact that apparently the secretary of state’s office <a href="http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2017/aug/01/kobach-drops-ball-publicizing-new-voting-schedule/">does not appear to have conducted any public outreach about the change in election cycles</a>. “We tried to get what word out that we could,” Douglas County Clerk Jamie Shew told the <em>Lawrence Journal</em> . “I think there was an anticipation that there would be kind of a statewide push getting information out. We’ll kind of evaluate it for us, how we increase that push locally.” Legislation approved in 2015 to change the election cycle included language requiring the secretary of state conduct a public information campaign, but according to the <em>LJ</em>, as of the afternoon on primary day, there was no information on the secretary of state’s homepage and no record could be found of any advertising or public service announcements.</p>
<p><strong>Utah County, Utah, conducting its first-ever vote-by-mail election</strong>, inadvertently sent 68,000 Republican ballots for the 3rd Congressional special election to unaffiliated voters. According to <em>The Desert News</em>, <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865685621/More-than-68000-mistakenly-sent-GOP-ballots-in-Utah-County.html">the error will cost the county an additional $15,000 to $20,000</a> to inform voters of the error. &#8220;We cross-checked, triple-checked, but in this particular case it did not get the appropriate level of scrutiny it should have,&#8221; County Clerk/Auditor Bryan Thompson told the paper. &#8220;We&#8217;re all human, mistakes happen, but that being said it&#8217;s still something that needs an additional level of oversight to review and keep this particular mistake from ever happening again.&#8221; Utah County was not alone though. <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865685987/Now-Wasatch-County-has-sent-GOP-congressional-primary-ballots-to-unaffiliated-voters.html">Wasatch County</a> reportedly sent about 1,400 GOP ballots to unaffiliated voters. &#8220;I like the vote by mail, but this has made it a little more confusing,&#8221; County Clerk Brent Titcomb told the paper. He said sending out notices to the voters who received the wrong ballots will cost about $700.</p>
<p><strong>About a dozen candidates running for office in three of the New York City boroughs</strong> <a href="https://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2017/8/1/candidates-seeking-change-rail-against-board-elections-brooklyn">protested outside of the Brooklyn Board of Elections this week calling for election reform</a>. The candidates, who are backed by the New York Bernie Sanders Committee for Changes, which is demanding an investigation into the 2016 primary, said the purge of hundreds of thousands of voters before the election was not a mistake. “The whole Board of Elections is appointed by the party leaders,” Michale Blecher, president of Politics Reborn told the <em>Brooklyn Eagle</em>. “We’re disappointed that to this day there has been no criminal investigation of what happened at the purge, and no real reform has actually been passed, to make sure something like this doesn’t happen again.”</p>
<p><strong>Personnel News:</strong> The Rev. <strong><a href="http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/section/6/article/124583/">Tom Smiley</a></strong> has been appointed chairman of the Hall County, Georgia board of elections. <strong><a href="http://www.dailyfreeman.com/general-news/20170728/ulster-county-democrats-tap-new-elections-commissioner">Ashley Dittus</a></strong> has been nominated to serve as the Ulster County Democratic election commissioner. <strong><a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/07/28/539989095/top-lawyer-for-civil-rights-at-justice-department-leaving-after-roughly-6-months">Thomas Wheeler</a></strong> has stepped down as the head of the Justice Department’s civil rights unit.

<p><strong><a href="http://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/AVR%20in%20Oregon%20FINAL.pdf">Automatic Voter Registration in Oregon</a></strong>&#8211; Sean McElwee, Brian Schaffner, and Jesse Rhodes, Demos, July 2017: Recent research about automatic voter registration (AVR) in Oregon, in place since January 2016, found 44 percent of those who were automatically registered voted in the November 2016 election.</p>
<p>In the state’s system, eligible but unregistered voters found through the Department of Motor Vehicles databases are notified by mail they will be added to the voter rolls. They can either decline registration within 21 days by returning a postcard to the state’s election authorities, choose a party, or they are automatically registered as Non-Affiliated.</p>
<ul>
<li>8 percent of enrollees opted out of registration;</li>
<li>11 percent chose a party; and</li>
<li>78 percent were automatically registered as Non-Affiliated.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report also assesses the impact of AVR on the diversity of the state’s electorate in 2016.</p></p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislations</strong>: By a 14-1 vote, the Senate Intelligence Committee moved a bill that would ensure the intelligence community is well-positioned to detect cyberattacks, <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Senate-panel-moves-bill-to-deter-foreign-meddling-11517889.php">strengthen information-sharing with states to protect voting systems</a> and “send a message to Moscow that we will not accept their aggressive actions.”</p>
<p>Also on Capitol Hill, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia) has submitted an <a href="http://wtvr.com/2017/07/27/warner-wants-election-hacking-to-warrant-a-us-cyber-response/">amendment to the Senate’s National Defense Authorization Act</a>. If approved, the amendment would add cyberattacks on federal state and local elections to a policy that declares the US should “employ all instruments of national power, including the use of offensive cyber capabilities” to respond to such cyber threats.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Gov. Jerry Brown (D) has signed legislation into law that will require the state’s child welfare system to provide voter registration resources and paperwork to <a href="https://signalscv.com/2017/08/01/governor-signs-bill-encourages-foster-youth-vote/">foster youth</a> when they are processing into adulthood.</p>
<p>Also in California, Assembly Bill 765 would give city and town councils the option to hold off on <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/01/potential-new-bill-focuses-on-pushing-off-special-elections/">special elections</a> and move a ballot issue to the next regularly scheduled election. Municipalities could still hold a special election if the issue was time sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware:</strong> Gov. John Carney (D) has signed a bill into law that will make it easier for residents from the First State to <a href="http://delawarepublic.org/post/new-law-eases-access-absentee-voting">vote absentee</a>. Under the new law, absentee requests will no longer have to be notarized.</p>
<p><strong>Guam:</strong> Sen. Mary Torres (R-Santa Rita) has introduced a bill that, in an effort to save money, would <a href="http://www.guampdn.com/story/news/2017/07/31/bill-introduced-move-primary-election-date-earlier/524452001/">move the primary</a> to the first Saturday in August instead of the current day which is the third Saturday in August.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: The Ward County commission voted this week to allow four precincts in the county to conduct their 2018 elections <a href="https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/08/some-county-voters-to-get-vote-by-mail-option/">all by mail</a>. Each of the four precincts has fewer than 300 voters.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: Gov. Gina Raimondo has signed <a href="http://ripr.org/post/rhode-island-becomes-ninth-state-automatic-voter-registration#stream/0">automatic voter registration</a> legislation into law. Rhode Island becomes the 9th state and the District of Columbia to automatically register residents to vote when conducting business with the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VI. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> Chief District Judge W. Keith Watkins has denied a request by advocacy groups for a preliminary injunction in lawsuit that seeks to have the <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/07/judge_blocks_immediate_restora.html">voting rights of Alabama felons automatically restored</a> following a change in state law that more clearly defines what felonies require someone to lose their voting rights.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Ray Lutz, founder of the Citizens Oversight Project has sued San Diego County seeking to <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-ballot-access-20170728-story.html">personally recount votes from the 2016 presidential primary</a> to see if the results were accurate. Lutz alleges that the difference in vote margins between early vote-by-mail ballots and votes cast at precincts on primary day was so large that likely fraud occurred. The county stands by the vote count and denies any fraud occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Secretary of State Kris Kobach has <a href="https://www.hayspost.com/2017/08/01/kobach-appeals-order-to-answer-under-oath-on-plan-to-change-election-law/">filed notice that he is appealing</a> the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals order that he submit to a deposition by the American Civil Liberties Union in a case regarding the state’s proof-of-citizenship law. On Wednesday, the Appeals Court <a href="http://www.kwch.com/content/news/Appeals-court-ruling-requires-Kobach-to-testify-under-oath-438189833.html">denied</a> the request.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina:</strong> Two judges of a three-judge panel of the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals said recently that they are concerned that legislative leadership has taken few, if any steps to <a href="http://www.phillytrib.com/news/judges-chide-slow-pace-of-fixing-voting-maps-in-n/article_c2dc29f7-558f-5a94-a965-f08f643ee195.html">draw new election maps</a> since the court struck those down last year. “What concerns, at least me, is the seriousness of how this is being taken by the legislature. This is serious,” Judge James A. Wynn of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals told a lawyer for the legislative leaders at a hearing in federal court in Greensboro.</p>
<p>On Monday, the panel rejected the request by voters to force the state to hold special elections. The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/judges-special-elections-redrawn-nc-districts-48957775">next legislative elections won’t occur until November 2018</a>. The judges gave lawmakers until Sept. 1 to get the new boundaries draw, but did say they would extend it until Sept. 15 if the lawmakers showed that they were working.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> In a legal brief, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted has told the Supreme Court of the United States that the Ohio’s <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2017/07/voting_rolls_should_be_culled.html">procedure for purging voters</a> does not violate federal prohibition against removing individuals for failing to vote. According to <em>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</em>, the brief said election boards ask inactive registrants to confirm their eligibility. Failure to respond to those confirmation notices, not failure to vote, is what triggers the cancelation of the voter’s registration.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments this week in a case that <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/ohio/articles/2017-08-02/court-to-hear-vote-count-case-over-tennessee-abortion-limits">questions the method state officials used to count votes</a> on an abortion amendment that was approved in 2014 by 53 percent of the vote. In the lower court ruling, U.S. District Judge Kevin Sharp wrote that the state violated due process and equal protection rights.</p></p>
