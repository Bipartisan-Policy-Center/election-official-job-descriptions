							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Social media opens avenues of communication</strong><br /><em>Twitter, Facebook other social media easily scalable for elections officials</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of all Americans are on one form of social media or another — Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.</p>
<p>According to the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans say they get their news from social media and half of the public <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/">used these sites</a> to learn about the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it — and there are definitely both camps — social media is a part of our everyday lives and can be an effective and perhaps most importantly inexpensive, way for elections officials to reach out to voters.</p>
<p>“Social media is great for organizations and election offices because it’s so easily scalable and allows two-way communication,” said Matthew Morse wit <a href="http://intesacom.com/">Intesa Communications Group</a> and formerly with Pew’s Election Initiatives. “For the first time ever, one person sitting in an election office can broadcast information to hundreds, even thousands of users with ease, then answer questions and have a public conversation in real time.”</p>
<p>Morse said it’s important for elections officials to be active and communication using the tools their constituents already use.</p>
<p>“Despite common stereotypes about who uses social media, there is, in fact, a hugely diverse community using these platforms, which spans across age, race, gender, and wealth distributions,” Morse said.</p>
<p>One Twitter account that caught electionline’s eye is that of Harford County, Maryland [and I’m not just saying that because my parents have been happy HarCo voters for more than 50 years]. The account, which is run by Sarah Mohan, program manager &#8211; Media and Outreach for the <a href="https://harfordvotes.info/">Harford County Board of Elections</a>, is timely, informative and can be <a href="https://twitter.com/HarfordVotes/status/889461574842417153">pretty funny</a> too.</p>
<p>“Each morning I check what the <a href="https://twitter.com/HarfordVotes/status/920267816166678528">national day</a> or week is. I will base a few tweets off of that. I also check what is trending for that day. I usually try to connect it to something election related,” Mohan explained. “I have also found that giving the voters of Harford County a glimpse into our office and the faces behind the election gets great feedback. I started #FunFactFriday when I initially took over the social media a little over a year ago. I try to keep the sites fun but informative. Election related but also not too dry. It keeps the voters engaged.”</p>
<p>Mohan noted that she’s fortunate that her directory and deputy director give her creative freedom with the board’s social media posts.</p>
<p>“As an office we stay non-partisan and our posts are no exception. If there is something going on in the world or a post that I think could come across as something that doesn’t reflect our mission, approval is necessary,” Mohan said. “I also make sure to watch what we like, retweet and share.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mohan said for those elections officials who are just getting started in social media, it’s important to make sure they get the correct information to the voters, but also in an engaging way — <a href="https://twitter.com/HarfordVotes/status/918545097469423617">fun but appropriate</a>. She also noted that liking, sharing and retweeting are your best friend.</p>
<p>“The more you help other social media accounts, the more they help you,” Mohan said. “It’s networking for the technological age. Also, pictures and GIFs will get you places. Everyone loves a relatable GIF and pictures are more appealing than a few words. Branding your own hashtag is great too (#HarfordVotes) it helps other uses get the big picture of what you’re all about.”</p>
<p>While Harford County’s site is run by their media outreach coordinator, elections offices don’t necessarily need to rely on a communications staffer/department to run their accounts. In Minneapolis, Mitch Kampf who runs the city’s social media accounts actually started as a temporary worker in absentee voting.</p>
<p>“…[O]nce we learned of his background with films and photography, we quickly shifted his time with us toward creating videos and building our social media presence—work that he maintained through the 2016 election and into 2017,” explained Tim Schwartz, election administrator for the <a href="http://vote.minneapolismn.gov/">City of Minneapolis</a>. “He was able to make create pieces that were informative while being entertaining. His stuff just looks good!”</p>
<p>In addition to running the social media accounts, Kampf has created several YouTube videos for the city including spots about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3paIYIbV9H0">vote-by-mail</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmjPwDni8BU">early voting</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOa5bdT1JnA">behind the scenes</a> video of Minneapolis elections.</p>
<p>Like Mohan, Kampf keeps a pretty close eye on current events and the elections calendar to curate his social media post, but he also doesn’t have a plan so-to-speak.</p>
<p>“Honestly, it’s pretty fast and free-flowing,” Kampf said. “I keep track of major elections milestones to post like National Voter Registration Day, the MN pre-registration deadline, the start of early voting, etc. I find it best to work without a formal calendar because social media is about starting or engaging in a conversation. We don’t plan out our everyday conversations weeks ahead of time, we react as events happen or new information comes to light.”</p>
<p>Kampf said it’s important not to take social media too seriously. He noted that lots of brands or agencies have started treating social media in too official of a capacity. For content creation, he likes to think there are three pilliars: Inform, Education, Entertain.</p>
<p>“Most people get the first tow, but being able to entertain and captivate an audience is really what matters most,” Kampf said. “The average person has no interest in following accounts that throw dates and numbers at them constantly. Sure, that information is important to give, especially for elections-related accounts but allowing yourself the creative space to be weird or irreverent, in my own experience, ends up spreading your overall message much better.”</p>
<p>Cameron Sasnett, general registrar in <a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/elections/">Fairfax County, Virginia</a> has found Facebook Live to be a useful tool. The Office of Elections uses Facebook Live to provide information about early voting and other elections announcements, but Sasnett also uses it on his personal Facebook page which is followed by many Virginia elections officials.</p>
<p>“On election night in 2016, I was down on the loading dock at my office watching the election materials return and decided to turn on my own personal Facebook Live to show off the tremendous work and coordination of my team and the logistics involved in the process,” Sasnett said. Since then, I’ve done my own Facebook live posts to give more of a “behind the scenes” insights of Election Day and night in my office.”</p>
<p>With a gubernatorial election fast-approaching, Sasnett said he plans to utilize Facebook Live again.</p>
<p>“Currently plans are similar to last year. &nbsp;We’ll do a number of OPA Facebook Live updates towards Election Day, reminding people of Absentee Voting deadlines and locations. &nbsp;We will also most likely have a Facebook Live with information about Election Day,” Sasnett said. We may perhaps even have a Facebook Live during the post election canvass to give the public insight as to how the results are reviewed and certified locally.” </p>
<p> Many elections officials have Facebook and Twitter accounts and some, like Mohan in Harford County, have ventured into other platforms such as Instagram with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>“Facebook and Twitter are the bread and butter of social media, and these should be a first and necessary step,” Morse said. “Other platforms are great too, but always remember the rule of quantity over quality. It’s better to have a great communications plan for two platforms than a poor execution across half a dozen.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Morse said, it’s important to view social media as a tool, not a panacea. It’s also important to have a plan for traditional media, alongside an on-the-ground strategy for meeting voters’ needs.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Update</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;II. Federal-State Update</strong></p>
<p>Top elections officials from around the country met this week to formalize the <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/dhs-and-top-election-officials-finally-meet-to-begin-hashing-out-critical-infrastructure-designation/article/2637588">Government Coordinating Council</a> that will formally communication with the Department of Homeland Security. According to the <em>Washington Examiner,</em> the move marks the first major step in the coming together between the National Association of Secretaries of State and DHS.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other importance of the coordinating council actually being formed, is that there is so much activity on the federal level regarding legislation, I think this will give us, hopefully, a venue to help us inform members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives that states are taking an active role and we are doing a lot to prepare ourselves for the 2018 elections and beyond,&#8221; said NASS President and Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson.</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klochubar (D-Minnesota) sent a letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke expressing her concerns about <a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2017/10/13/klochubar-kaspersky-dhs-voting.aspx">cybersecurity vendor Kaspersky Lab</a> and its connection to voting system. &#8220;The potential threat posed to our election infrastructure by the use of Kaspersky software appears to be significant and it is essential to ensure that future elections are safeguarded from foreign interference,&#8221; Klochubar wrote according to <em>FCW</em>.</p>
<p>Klochubar, along Sens. Corey Booker (D-New Jersey) and Michael Bennet (D- Colorado), has also written to the U.S. Government Accountability Office asking the agency to <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2017/10/18/michael-bennet-investigation-trump-voter-commission/">examine the spending</a> of the presidential election commission.</p>
<p>“We fear that the manner in which the (commission) is conducting its work will prevent the public from a full and transparent understanding of the commission’s conclusions and unnecessarily diminish confidence in our democratic process,” wrote the three lawmakers according to <em>The Denver Post</em>.</p>
<p>In other election commission news, Ronald Williams II, 37 of Suitland, Maryland was arrested after authorities found child pornography on his phone. Williams was a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/10/14/trump-voter-fraud-commission-researcher-arrested-on-child-pornography-charges/?utm_term=.31cf98821c3e">researcher for the presidential election commission</a>. Williams was on assignment to the commission from the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency. He has since been terminated.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, one of the Democrats serving on the presidential election commission old MSNBC that he has <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2017/10/13/matt-dunlap-says-hes-heard-nothing-from-trump-voter-fraud-commission-for-a-month/">heard nothing</a> from staff or anyone else on the commission in almost a month.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> The League of Women Voters of Texas and the Texas NAACP, with the backing of the Brennan Center for Justice have <a href="http://www.dailytoreador.com/news/league-of-women-voters-files-suit-against-texas-secretary-of/article_0a3c6a86-b1fb-11e7-b32c-e7587750f690.html">filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Rolando Pablos</a>. The lawsuit was filed out of concern that Pablos’ releasing of Texas voter registration information to the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity could potentially be harmful to voters.</p></p>

														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commissioners in McLennan County, Texas approved $17,000</strong> <a href="http://www.wacotrib.com/news/elections/ada-repairs-for-vote-center-to-cost-more-than-expected/article_aedac92a-be44-5b1a-bc12-cb768255c60d.html">to bring a local church into compliance with the American with Disabilities Act</a> in order for it to continue serving as a vote center. The cost is $6,000 more than originally planned and under an agreement reached with the church, the church will have to serve as a vote center through 2024 or refund the money to the county. The county had to stop using some churches as vote centers because the cost to bring them into compliance with the ADA was too high, as much as $70,000 in one chase The county is complying this a settlement agreement it reached with the Department of Justice after the DOJ identified hundreds of ADA violations in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Lewis County, Washington has <a href="http://www.chronline.com/news/eight-new-drop-boxes-installed-before-ballots-are-mailed-wednesday/article_ffb2f412-b363-11e7-9eca-3b5b175bdd77.html">added eight new ballot drop boxes</a></strong> bringing the county’s total up to 14. According to The Chronicle, the drop boxes are the result of a new state law that requires a minimum of one drop box per 15,000 registered voters. While the county met the numbers threshold, the law also requires each city, town and census-designated area in the county to have a drop box. The drop boxes cost anywhere from $3,200 to $4,5000 to install. “The cooperation of the cities, fire districts and school district was key in making this happen prior to the upcoming general election,” Auditor Larry Grove told the paper. “Lewis County facilities crew worked diligently to ensure that all site prep work and installation was completed in a timely manner.”</p>
<p><strong>According to AL.com, elections officials across Alabama</strong> <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/10/alabama_election_officials_rem.html">remain confused over which felons may vote and those that may not</a> after the state changed the law earlier this year. Registrars told the AL.com they were not entirely clear about the intricacies of the law how it applies to their duties. Secretary of State John Merrill told AL.com that he spoke with nearly 150 registrars at a June meeting outlining the new law and that there have been several smaller workshops held throughout the state. Mary Ann Swann, chairwoman of the Henry County Board of Registrars, said her board&#8217;s members have continued to use their own discretion to decide what crimes are considered of moral turpitude. &#8220;We&#8217;re just now beginning to get into the system where we don&#8217;t make that determination. We&#8217;re going to be leaving that decision up to [the Alabama Board of] Pardons and Paroles,&#8221; Swann said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve made that decision in the past month &#8211; whether or not [a felony is of] moral turpitude.&#8221;</p>

														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> Sen. Rusty Glover (R-Semmes) is proposing amending the state’s constitution so that if a vacancy for public office occurs in the last two years of term, the governor will appoint someone rather than having the state conduct a <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/10/alabama_senators_proposal_woul.html">costly special election</a>.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Gov. Jerry Brown (D) has signed legislation into law that allows San Diego to change its charter and move county elections to <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-election-change-20171012-story.html">a top two primary</a>, even if one candidate clearly wins the majority of votes.</p>
<p>Brown also signed Assembly Bill 918 into law which will require local elections officials to provide <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-voters-who-don-t-speak-1508170418-htmlstory.html">more voting materials in the languages of the community’s voters</a>, including sample ballots. The new law will require more copies of non-English sample ballots in specific precincts, and more signs in these polling places notifying voters with limited English skills of these election materials. The new law also requires more help for these voters who cast ballots by mail, and more information to be posted on local election websites about getting a copy of a “facsimile ballot.”</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> A group of citizens are collecting signatures to put a referendum on the March 18, 2018 primary ballot that, if approved, would <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/aurora-beacon-news/news/ct-abn-aurora-election-st-1019-20171018-story.html">eliminate the Aurora Election Commission</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Maine:</strong> During a special session of the Legislature, the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee held a public meeting on a proposal that would implement parts of the voter-approved initiation to move Maine to <a href="http://mainepublic.org/post/ranked-choice-voting-approved-referendum-still-stymies-maine-legislature#stream/0">ranked choice voting</a>.
