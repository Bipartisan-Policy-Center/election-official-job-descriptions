							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Election observation provides opportunity to assess voting system</strong><br /><em>Roller coaster experience was ‘experience of a lifetime’ for observer</em></p>
<p>By David Levine<br />Special to electionlineWeekly</p>
<p>(<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> This week, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe&#8217;s Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) released its Election Observation Mission Final Report from the November 8, 2016 election. The <a href="http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/usa/294196?download=true">full report</a> can be found <a href="http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/usa/294196?download=true">here</a>. Frequent electionline contributor David Levine served on the Mission. His observations are featured in this week’s electionlineWeekly.)</p>
<p>At the invitation of the U.S. Mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to observe the November 8, 2016 general elections, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) assessed the pre-election environment and preparations for the US 2016 General Election.</p>
<p>Most of those with whom OSCE/ODIHR spoke expressed confidence in the administration of the election, but they also welcomed OSCE/ODIHR election observation activity because they were concerned about matters such as:</p>
<p>1) the implementation of new state laws regarding voter registration and identification;<br />2) changes to alternative voting methods (such as early voting and vote by mail);<br />3) the reliability of voting technologies;<br />4) the effectiveness of campaign finance rules; and<br />5) the conduct of the campaign, particularly in the media.</p>
<p>In the end, OSCE/ODIHR recommended the deployment of an Election Observation Mission – a core team of analysts, a group of long-term observers to follow the electoral process countrywide, and a larger group of short-term observers to follow Election Day proceedings.</p>
<p>This was the first time OSCE/ODIHR has deployed an entire election observation mission to the United States for an election.</p>
<p>As is always the case, the Mission principals hailed from outside the U.S., mostly Europe. But they were supported by a staff that included U.S. election analysts whose job was to guide them through (and help them understand) our unique process.</p>
<p>Early in October I joined the Mission as the Senior Legal Analyst Assistant to the Legal Analyst. The job was to assist the Legal Analyst in assessing the U.S.’s compliance with its OSCE commitments and international standards for democratic elections and national legislation.</p>
<p>That was a daunting task because unlike most nations, the U.S. legal framework for general elections is highly decentralized and complex, with significant differences among states. I consider myself an election professional, in part because of the work I’ve done helping administer elections in Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., but even in those jurisdictions the laws had changed, and I had never personally administered elections in the other 47+ states and territories.</p>
<p>For the next six weeks, life was a roller coaster ride as we attempted to stay abreast of election developments across the country.</p>
<p>One day, I would research the number of disenfranchised convicts and ex-convicts, including those facing trial, assessing the U.S.’s compliance with universal and equal suffrage, as provided in the OSCE commitments.</p>
<p>Another time I researched, analyzed and interpreted state voter identification rules, assessing their impact on the integrity of the vote and the disenfranchisement of eligible voters, and weighing the impact of lawsuits concerning those rules on voters and election officials.</p>
<p>In the end, the job was both rewarding and challenging. I took great comfort in the fact that the November 8, 2016 elections were well administered despite a campaign filled with harsh personal attacks, legal changes and decisions on technical aspects of the electoral process that burdened (and often confused) voters and administrators.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I saw an election system that still has room for improvement. About one in seven of the International Election Observation Mission (IEOM) observers throughout the United States reported voting equipment malfunctions, which can likely be attributed at least in part to the use of outdated equipment that hasn’t been replaced due to a lack of money.</p>
<p>Ten percent of the observers reported that voters had to wait in line thirty minutes or more due to inadequate polling place staffing and/or high voter turnout, especially in the morning and just before polls closed.</p>
<p>And contrary to the nation’s OSCE Commitments, the International Election Observation Mission (IEOM) to the United States was not able to freely observe early voting and Election Day in 17 states.</p>
<p>While citizen observers and party representatives were able to observe throughout the country, adding transparency and confidence to the election process, the failure to allow international observers not only violates our OSCE Commitments, but provides critics the false impression that those states are engaging in unbecoming behavior or have something to hide.</p>
<p>Serving as Senior Legal Analyst Assistant for this IEOM was the experience of a lifetime, and I would encourage anyone with a professional interest in elections to do it.</p>
<p>The analysts themselves are some of the foremost experts in their fields, which encompass media, political, legal, and security analysis in the election context. Many of the short and long-term observers help administer elections in their home countries, and getting their insights about the election process in a particular state or a jurisdiction was fascinating and will be helpful in the long run.</p>
<p>The only way to really understand how an election works is to help administer one. But to objectively assess how well an election is conducted there are few things better than serving as an international observer.</p>

							<h2>VIP Feedback</h2>
														<p><strong>II. VIP Feedback</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where should the Voting Information Project go from here?</strong></p>
<p>As you may have heard, The Pew Charitable Trusts has initiated a planning process to determine the <a href="http://votinginfoproject.org/news/where-should-voting-information-project-go-here/">future of the Voting Information Project</a> (VIP). And as part of that process, we are seeking input from the field on what stakeholders think should be the next phase of VIP.</p>
<p>To that end, we invite you to submit your views—ideally no more than 500 words—on the following topics:</p>
<p>1. What should VIP continue to do? What should it change?</p>
<p>2. What can VIP teach about—and learn from—its efforts?</p>
<p>3. Are there other opportunities for VIP (or a project like it)?</p>
<p>4. What changes to VIP would make election officials more or less likely to participate?</p>
<p>5. What communities are currently being missed by projects like VIP, and how can we address those shortcomings?</p>
<p>6. Who else is doing work in this space, and how might VIP contribute to those efforts—and vice versa?</p>
<p>7. What other questions should we be asking?</p>
<p>The deadline for feedback is <strong>Monday, Jan. 30</strong>; please send your submissions to <a href="mailto:future@votinginfoproject.org">future@votinginfoproject.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We plan to make the submissions available to the community; please let us know if you’d prefer not to be featured publicly.</p>
<p> We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your contributions.</p>

														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler</strong> is hoping that the incoming presidential administration will <a href="http://www.kalb.com/content/news/LA-SOS--411018555.html">reverse the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to classify election infrastructure as “critical”</a>. “I have yet to hear of a single secretary of state from either side of the aisle who is in favor of this designation,” said Schedler. “We all feel railroaded by this announcement and have serious concerns about the way in which this announcement was delivered and its timing. When it comes to election integrity, I am not going to let the federal government have the keys to our secured election system unless they can better articulate their intentions&#8221; Schedler sent a letter to the incoming administration requesting the reversal and he also said that he and other secretaries may consider a resolution of opposition at the upcoming NASS winter meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), leader of the House Committee</strong> on Oversight and Government Reform has sent a letter to DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson and Inspector John Roth asking about <a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2017/01/18/chaffetz-dhs-election-scan.aspx">“unauthorized scans” and “unsuccessful attempts to penetrate&#8221;</a> the Georgia Secretary of State&#8217;s firewall from last February into November&#8217;s election season. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Because it’s never too early to start planning</strong>, clerks in Colorado have already starting looking ahead and are exploring the possibility of <a href="http://kiowacountypress.net/content/52-vote-county-clerks-explore-changing-early-voting-requirements">shortening the amount of early voting time</a>. According to an article in the <em>Kiowa County Press,</em> they would like more leeway when it comes to providing early voting locations. Arapahoe County Clerk Matt Crane&nbsp;told a meeting of the Bipartisan Election Advisory Commission that the data suggests the first week could be eliminated &#8211; his county spent $52 per vote over those six days. But he said&nbsp;one option for Arapahoe might be reducing locations for that first week from 11 to just the clerk&#8217;s office and the four Motor Vehicle offices.</p>
<p><strong>For the second time this year</strong>, the St. Croix Elections Board has been forced to cancel a meeting because it <a href="http://stthomassource.com/content/news/local-news/2017/01/18/st-croix-elections-board-cancels-second-2017-meeting-lack-quorum">failed to meet quorum</a>. According to the <em>St. Thomas Source</em>, on Jan. 5 three members of the board waited for more than an hour for enough members to show up, when they didn’t the meeting was rescheduled for Jan. 18. Once again, not enough members showed up to make quorum. “There has to be a legal precedence that would cause members to attend meetings,” Boardmember Raymond Williams told the paper. The board, which needs to hold an organizing meet, will try again in February.</p>
<p><strong>There’s been a lot of real news about fake news</strong> and this <em>New York Times</em> article is an interesting look at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/us/fake-news-hillary-clinton-cameron-harris.html?_r=2&amp;mtrref=nbc4i.com">how quickly fake news can spread</a>.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Rep. Bob Thorpe has introduced legislation that would make it <a href="http://tucson.com/news/local/arizona-lawmaker-would-keep-some-students-from-voting/article_f00466cb-9710-5fa6-9753-67d49a8da9ec.html">illegal to use a dormitory address</a> “or other temporary college or university address” to register to vote in Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> Rep. Jonathan Singer (D-Longmont) has introduced legislation that would give jurisdictions the option to use <a href="http://www.boulderweekly.com/news/third-times-a-charm/">approval voting methods</a> in nonpartisan elections. House Bill 17-0608 would allow voters to check as many candidates as they like in races where political affiliations aren’t on the ballot, such as city councils and school boards. But the law would not require any jurisdictions to use such methods.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> Lawmakers in Hawaii are preparing to once again consider legislation that would transition the state to most a <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/34250916/lawmakers-to-again-consider-vote-by-mail-system-automatic-voter-registration">vote-by-mail</a> state and that would automatically register voters when they got a new or renewed their driver’s licenses.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> A bill before the General Assembly would consolidate voting precincts in Lake County into smaller precincts. Rep. Harold Slager, R-Schererville, filed a bill to establish a commission to develop a plan to <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/news/ct-ptb-lake-county-precinct-consolidation-st-0115-20170113-story.html">consolidate Lake County voting precincts</a> with less than 600 active voters. Proponents say the legislation will create savings for the county, while detractors decry consolidation efforts as making it difficult for residents to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Gov. Sam Brownback (R) has signed a quick-moving bill <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article127322229.html">fixing state election laws</a> governing special elections. The new law extends the length of time for a special election in order to ensure that absentee ballots can be mailed to military and overseas voters.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> Secretary of State Allison Lundergan Grimes has included <a href="http://westkentuckystar.com/News/State/Kentucky/Grimes-Again-Backing-Early-Voting.aspx">early voting</a> in her legislative agenda for 2017 and Rep. Jody Richards (D-Bowling Green) has introduced the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Legislation has been introduced that would allow for <a href="http://michiganradio.org/post/house-democrats-start-year-push-voter-reform">no-excuse absentee voting</a> and automatic voter registration.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> Sen. David Sater (R-Cassville) has introduced legislation that would implement <a href="http://www.monett-times.com/story/2378168.html">ranked choice voting</a> in Missouri by 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> Rep. Greg Hertz (R-HD-11) has introduced legislation that would <a href="http://mtpr.org/post/bill-would-end-election-day-holiday">remove Election Day as a state holiday</a>. Hertz told Montana Public Radio that he was approached by several constituents about why some people got the day off when others did not. Linda Stoll with the Montana Association of Clerks and Recorders and Election Administrators says county officials need government employee volunteers to help run polls. She testified against the bill.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: According to the <em>Union Leader</em>, <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/state-government/Forty-bills-in-NH-Legislature-target-voting-01172017">as many as 40 bills</a> to change the Granite State’s election laws will soon be working their way through the Legislature, but the paper opines that only a few will end up on the governor’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: Democrats have introduced an amendment to the state’s constitution that would <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/legislature/democrats-propose-amendment-calling-for-automatic-voter-registration/article_30797c18-28b0-5fd7-8b0d-661a0395f2ca.html">automatically register</a> residents to vote when they received a new or updated license from the state’s motor vehicle division.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> Like in Kansas, legislators in Utah are scrambling to <a href="http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/11997-lawmakers-racing-to-fix-gaping-hole-in-utah-election-law">update election laws</a> in the likelihood that Rep. Chris Stewart may be appointed to serve in the new presidential administration. Currently Utah has no procedure for filing a vacant seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. According to <em>Utah Policy</em>, the current law states: &#8220;When a vacancy occurs for any reason in the office of a representative in Congress, the governor shall issue a proclamation calling an election to fill the vacancy.&#8221; The law does not specify how soon he has to call the election, and how that election will be conducted.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> The House elections subcommittee has <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/article_a9597552-86c4-5e3c-aed2-a5891078b070.html">killed several elections-related bills</a> including one that would have eliminated the voter ID requirement for Virginians. Other vetoed bills would have expanded absentee and early voting and allowed out-of-state college IDs and IDs issued by nursing homes to the forms of ID acceptable for voting purposes.</p>
<p>Also in Virginia, following a bumpy special election where several polling places ran out of ballots, Sen. Steve Newman (R-Bedford County) announced plans to introduce a bill that would require local registrars to <a href="http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/sen-newman-proposing-bill-to-prevent-ballot-shortages-following-special/article_b33a0420-dcdd-11e6-b864-3740d8af64df.html">issue a certain percentage of ballots for special election</a>.</p></p>
