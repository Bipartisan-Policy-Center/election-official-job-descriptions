							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you want something done right, do it yourself<br /></strong><em>Seminole County, Florida’s supervisor of elections builds new website</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>electionline.org</p>
<p>With nearly 40 percent of visitors to the <a href="https://www.voteseminole.org/">Seminole County, Florida supervisor of elections’ website</a> visiting on a phone or tablet, Elections Supervisor Michael Ertel realized that the site simply wasn’t responsive and those using hand-held devices were getting less of an experience than the desktop users.</p>
<p>It had also been at least five years since the site was last redone and in the world of website modernization, five years is a lifetime.</p>
<p>“I wanted to equalize the experience for all visitors, regardless of their point of entry into our online presence,” Ertel explained.</p>
<p>So, after receiving quotes for thousands and thousands of dollars for a new website, Ertel decided to learn design and build the site himself.</p>
<p>“I looked at the scope of work they were proposing, checked out some of the sites they were touting as examples, and then looked into the small business web portals like SquareSpace, Wix, DudaOne, WordPress-themed sites, and others,” Ertel explained. “I looked at their templates, and realized I could do what we needed myself.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Seminole_Website.jpg" alt="Seminole Website" style="display: block; margin: 5px auto; border: 1px none #000000;" /></p>
<p>The entire thing cost the county $299, which was the ultimate website-for-life plan from <a href="https://www.dudamobile.com/responsive-website-builder">DudaOne</a>. Other than Ertel’s time, no other money was spent.</p>
<p>The new site also allows the county to comply with new federal ADA regulations, as well as create a fully bilingual site. The old site was also using WordPress, which is not the most secure format. The new site is much more secure, including an SSL certificate for each page.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another benefit, is the supervisor of elections office now has 100 percent control of the design and content of the site, so the office can make changes on the fly, without having to contact the vendor and wait for a response.</p>
<p>“I have the ability with this platform to have geographic as well as time-based pop-ups appear on any page. This way, as sample ballots come out for a specific city, if a voter visits the site, from that city, we can have a pop-up appear letting them know the sample ballot is ready for their specific city,” Ertel explained. “Also, I can run a timed banner or pop-up on the site letting voters know what is happening right now, i.e., early voting is going on today until 7; or the polls close in two hours &#8212; click here to find your neighborhood-based polling location.”</p>
<p>It took Ertel, who has a background in journalism and designed newspapers and newsletters when he was in the Army, a little less than a month of part time and weekend work to design the new site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The core site was done in a week, but I massaged the design for a few weeks,” Ertel explained. “As for design and coding, I did it myself, but I did send beta versions of the site to some local web designers to have them do usability testing of it. I also had our staff check and update anything I put on there to make sure I provided the most current information.”</p>
<p>The response to the new site has been overwhelmingly positive, although people were skeptical when they found out Ertel was redoing the site himself.</p>
<p>“I announced on Facebook that I was redoing the site myself and got some negative feedback from people before it went live, as they assumed it would not look good,” Ertel said. “After the site was published, we have had universal praise for the design and functionality.”</p>
<p>Ertel said one of the key things to remember when redesign the was to lead the voters to the site. Everything above the fold or on the first screen visitors see, without scrolling, is about the voter. He included quotes and photos from real voters about they #VoteSeminole.</p>
<p>“That brings the entire community together around our operation. It&#8217;s a very uniting message, as voting is a uniting function of our republic,” Ertel said.</p>
<p>He avoided jargon and wrote the site in plain-speaking terms. Phrases like &#8220;book closing&#8221; and &#8220;precincts&#8221; were replaced with &#8220;deadlines&#8221; and &#8220;neighborhood-based polling locations.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, main calls to action tabs are written in first person, so voters can more easily define what each link does. Another thing was to reduce the number of visible options on the front page to those things which voters (through tracking earlier web stats, and also conducting a Facebook poll), most wanted to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As you know, I advocate that we are not just in the elections business, but the voter engagement and opportunity fulfillment business, so engaging our voters via social media during ‘the off season,’ keeps voters bookmarking our page and continually coming back,” Ertel explained. “The call to action to tell us why you #VoteSeminole on the top of the page is a perfect example of keeping our voters engaged.&nbsp; As time goes, we&#8217;ll update the featured voters, so the site will seem new every time you visit it.”</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>This week the Fargo, North Dakota council</strong> heard public input on a proposal that would move Fargo to an <a href="http://www.inforum.com/news/4241596-fargo-could-be-first-city-use-approval-voting">approval voting system</a> — making them the only city in the country to do so. The system would only be in use for city elections. According to InForum, an elections task force looking into the possibility said the city’s elections equipment could handle the switch to approval voting for little additional money.</p>
<p><strong>Residents of St. Paul, Minnesota approved</strong> <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/03/27/push-to-vote-st-paul-ranked-choice">ranked-choice voting</a> back in 2009, but now opponents of the voting system are hoping to put the issues before the voters again this fall. &#8220;It promises a lot of things and it doesn&#8217;t deliver on any of them,&#8221; says Chuck Repke, who is leading the effort to get ranked choice voting repealed.</p>
<p><strong>Faced with replacing five elected officials</strong> through special elections, the South Carolina Election Commission has asked lawmakers for permission to <a href="http://www.independentmail.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/28/sc-officials-seek-leftover-funds-special-elections/99727636/">dip into the rainy day fund</a>. The fund, about $255,000, is leftover from other election programs. “Historically, we have a handful of them a year,” Chris Whitmire told The Independent Mail. “This year, we’re already at a handful, and we’ve got about nine more months to go.” In addition to the five current vacancies, the state election commission is concerned there could be a domino effect from those open seats.</p>
<p><strong>Once the setting for many great high school movies</strong>, the shopping mall is becoming a thing of the past as large anchors like Macy’s close up shop. But one Maryland county has an idea. Washington County has sent a letter intent to the owner of the Valley Mall about pursuing a contract to <a href="http://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/local/washington-county-wants-to-move-election-board-to-former-macy/article_ead77f4d-0521-5f9c-882f-16d5ba07c88b.html">lease the former Macy’s space for election board offices</a> and an early-voting site. The county&#8217;s proposed budget includes $65,000 for annual rent for about 20,000 square feet in the former Macy&#8217;s space, officials told the Herald Mail. Julie Rohm, the mall’s manager said the Washington County Board of Elections would be a great addition to the mall, where officials love to have small local spaces that tie into the community. The county thinks the centralized location with massive amounts of parking would help with early voting.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Although Gov. Doug Ducey (R) has recently signed a citizen initiative bill, another bill is on a fast track. Under this legislation, elections officials would be required to <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/legislature/2017/03/27/late-arriving-bill-aims-tighten-arizona-ballot-initiative-rules-even-more/99691088/">toss out petitions</a> if they don’t strictly comply with legal standards.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) has signed a bill into law that will require voters to show a <a href="http://www.arkansasnews.com/news/20170324/arkansas-governor-signs-voter-id-bill-into-law">photo ID</a> in order to cast a ballot.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> The Assembly Elections and Redistricting Committee has approved an <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/29/santa-clara-county-election-error-audit-in-the-works/">audit of Santa Clara County’s registrar of voter’s office</a>. The county has suffered a series mistakes during elections since about 2010. “It’s not uncommon for administrative mistakes to be made, but the frequency of these mistakes is of particular concern,” Assemblyman Evan Low (D-Campbell), chair of the committee said. “And I don’t know of any other county having such issues.”</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> A House bill (HB 105) that would allow voters to <a href="http://floridapolitics.com/archives/234598-vote-mail-ballots-fix">fix mismatching signatures on their vote-by-mail ballots</a> has been approved by the full House 113-0. A Senate companion bill has not yet had a hearing.</p>
<p>The House Government Accountability Committee has approved a bill that would <a href="http://saintpetersblog.com/house-advances-bill-change-tampa-municipal-election-dates/">change the dates for municipal elections</a> in Tampa to every four years.</p>
<p>The Senate Rules Committee has approved SB 882 that would make the <a href="http://saintpetersblog.com/senate-continues-roll-bill-making-secretary-state-elected-position/">secretary of state’s position</a> an elected instead of appointed one.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> A Senate committee has approved a “watered down” bill that would require the BMV to offer residents the chance to register to vote, but it would not <a href="http://wbaa.org/post/senate-committee-approves-watered-down-bmv-voter-registration-bill#stream/0">automatically register</a> anyone to vote as the bill had originally called for.</p>
<p>Also in Indiana, a bill that would <a href="http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/lake-precinct-consolidation-mandate-headed-to-governor/article_17b55a91-9453-5b87-a630-9859f5927f48.html">reduce the number of Lake County precincts</a> is on its way to the governor’s desk. The House voted 59-30 to approve the bill.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> The Senate has approved Secretary of State Paul Pate’s <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/23/voter-id-bill-gets-iowa-senate-ok-after-contentious-debate/99527932/">Election Integrity bill</a> that would among other things, require a voter to show an ID, either a state-issued photo ID or special state-issued voter ID card.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Several lawmakers have filed bills that would <a href="http://wwlp.com/2017/03/23/lawmakers-propose-electronic-voter-registration-system/">require Massachusetts to join ERIC</a>. Membership could cost the state about $500,000 annually. One bill would automatically register voters who register a car or get a license from the Registry of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> State lawmakers have rebuffed an attempt to <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/gop-lawmakers-reject-another-push-to-boost-voter-photo-id/article_4a298261-54bc-548c-9df8-7faaef2ccc33.html">increase the amount of spending for voter ID education</a>. Rep. Peter Merideth (D-St. Louis) suggested taking $3 million from the $16 million lottery budget to bolster the voter ID education efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> A bill that would have allowed county elections administrators to conduct an <a href="http://mtpr.org/post/vote-mail-bill-likely-dead-after-being-tabled-committee">upcoming special election solely by mail</a> has been tabled in a House committee. With the clock ticking on decision, Democrats had attempted to push the bill to a full House vote, but instead, the committee voted to table the bill, which for all intents and purposes ends any attempt to do an all-mail election because ballots need to be in the mail by April 10.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Under Assembly Bill 293, the state’s political parties would be allowed to have <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/assembly-bill-could-clear-way-presidential-primary-instead">presidential preference primaries</a> instead of caucuses.</p>
<p>Also in Nevada, under Senate Bill 492, the state’s two largest counties — Clark and Washoe — would move to a <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/voting-centers-may-become-fixture-all-elections-clark-county">vote center</a> system for future elections.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Assemblymember Robert Carroll has introduced a bill that would <a href="https://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2017/3/23/carroll-seeks-lower-voting-age-17">lower the state’s voting age</a> from 18 to 17. Under the legislation, students would also be allowed to register to vote during high school civics classes. “Seventeen-year-old New Yorkers contribute to their communities. They hold jobs. They pay taxes. When they commit crimes, they are tried as adults. They should be full participants in our democracy,” Carroll told the Brooklyn Eagle.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> By a 19 to 10 vote, the Senate has approved a bill that will allow residents to <a href="http://nwpr.org/post/oregon-senate-backs-voter-pre-registration-age-16">pre-register</a> to vote beginning at age 16.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> By a 21-10 vote, the Senate has given tentative approval to a bill that would revamp the state’s <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/03/27/texas-senate-tentatively-approves-voter-id-fix/">voter ID rules</a>. Senate Bill would add options for Texas voters who say they cannot “reasonably” obtain one of the seven forms of ID currently required at the polls.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) once again broke out his veto pen this time to <a href="http://www.newsplex.com/content/news/McAuliffe-vetoes-bills-concerning-voter-registration-417199663.html">veto several elections-related bills</a> including Senate Bill 1253 that would have required electronic poll books to contain photographs of registered voters. He also vetoed Senate Bill 1455 that would made it a misdemeanor for a person to give, offer or promise monetary payment to another person in exchange for that person registering to vote.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia</strong>: The House Judiciary Committee has approved an <a href="http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news-politics/20170323/wv-house-committee-sends-watered-down-voter-id-bill-to-floor">amended version of a new voter ID bill</a> and sent it to the full House for consideration. According to the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the original bill would have required a state-issued photo ID to vote, but the new version of the bill only delays last year’s voter ID law until July 1, 2019. Under that legislation people can show a variety of forms of ID including utility bill and having someone vouch for you.</p></p>

<p><strong>Voting Information Project Seeks New Home</strong><br /><em>Market analysis will help gauge interest, identify appropriate options</em></p>
<p>Last September, the <a href="http://votinginfoproject.org/news/voting-information-project-seeks-new-home/">Voting Information Project (VIP)</a><a href="http://votinginfoproject.org/news/whats-next-voting-information-project/">announced</a> that it was beginning a process to identify its next phase, as The Pew Charitable Trusts transitions away from elections work.</p>
<p>As part of that effort, VIP identified a group of stakeholders from the elections, civic tech and data, and academic communities that has been discussing how best to continue the project’s success in partnering with election officials, businesses, and organizations to deliver vital information to voters across the nation.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://votinginfoproject.org/news/where-should-voting-information-project-go-here/">January</a>, the group sought feedback from the field and was impressed by the depth and breadth of the enthusiasm for VIP and its continued work on behalf of voters.</p>
<p>Today, we wanted to share an update on where the project stands and what happens next:</p>
<ol>
<li>The stakeholders’ group is finalizing a set of principles that will lay out the future vision for the Voting Information Project, including the work to be done and the desired characteristics of a new home for the project.</li>
<li>Those principles will be shared with the field, including on this blog, as part of a formal invitation for parties to indicate their interest in acting as the next home for VIP.</li>
<li>Based on those responses, Pew expects to identify and transition to that new home in time for the 2018 elections.</li>
</ol>
<p>In preparation, Pew is working to identify the value of VIP to the field, both historically and going forward, by conducting a market analysis for the project’s continued operation. <a href="http://www.votinginfoproject.org/documents/4/Voting_Information_Project_RFI_2017.pdf">A Request for Information seeking firms that can conduct that analysis is available here</a>. We will keep posting updates as the selection process for VIP’s new home moves ahead. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This process has us excited about what’s next for the Voting Information Project, and we can’t wait to hear from those of you who are interested in continuing the mission of serving America’s voters.</p>
