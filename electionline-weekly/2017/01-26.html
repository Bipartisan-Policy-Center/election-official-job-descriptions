							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exit Interview: Helen Purcell</strong><br /><em>For more than quarter of a century Purcell ran Maricopa County elections</em></p>
<p>By Tammy Patrick<br />Bipartisan Policy Center</p>
<p>Election professionals live in an odd space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We spend our careers advancing reforms for continuous improvement, network with others to find the very best practices to implement and serve our public, many put it all on the line as a candidate to continue that effort and are then reliant upon the system they helped to create and have tended to for years to allow them another term.</p>
<p>December and January are bittersweet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congratulations to the victors and condolences to those who did not prevail in the race and to the many outstanding professionals who served at their pleasure and subsequently leave the field.</p>
<p>I was very fortunate to work in Maricopa County Elections Department under County Recorder Helen Purcell and Elections Director Karen Osborne. I would not be doing the work that I do today without their tutelage and the support they provided for the eleven years I worked in their office so I jumped at the chance to do an interview for electionline.org to share with you some words of wisdom from one of our nation’s very best.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Purcell1.jpeg" alt="Purcell1" width="433" height="243" style="display: block; margin: 5px auto; border: 1px none #000000;" /></p>
<p><strong>Tammy:</strong> It is always interesting to find out the path of election administrators. How did you get into elections? What prompted you to run for County Recorder?</p>
<p><strong>Helen:</strong> In the mid-80s I served for 4 or 5 years as the voter registration chair for the Republican party and was frustrated with the responsiveness of the Recorder’s office.&nbsp; It was very difficult to get any information out of them. I had always said that I never wanted to run for office, but something had to be done. Although it has gotten somewhat better than it was in those days, often times women have to have more qualifications than men do—they aren’t asked “what are your qualifications to run for Recorder?”—but I had qualifications as I had worked for years with mortgage recordings in addition to the voter registration.&nbsp; I ran against the incumbent, also a Republican.&nbsp; He wasn’t happy about it. He decided not to run for Recorder and instead had an unsuccessful Board of Supervisors bid.</p>
<p><strong>Tammy:</strong> Elections and the recording of documents changed dramatically over your tenure in Maricopa County, with you at the helm. What do you see as the most impactful changes that were implemented?</p>
<p><strong>Helen:</strong> Things have certainly changed since I was first elected in 1988.&nbsp;In 1996 we moved away from punch cards and took the monumental step to optical scan equipment because of the issues we were seeing with the punch card machines.&nbsp; When the 2000 debacle hit along with the Help America Vote Act, we were glad we were ahead of the curve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We implemented early voting to expand chances for voters to participate. Now the majority of our voters choose to vote that way; in some elections, upwards of 90 percent of the ballots cast will be early. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Motor Voter was in place, it expanded to include online voter registration.</p>
<p><strong>Tammy:</strong> So, basically every facet of elections has changed over your time in office from&nbsp;the way voters get on the rolls, when they can vote, and the equipment used to capture their intent.</p>
<p><strong>Helen:</strong> Yes, and that is just the election-side of the office.&nbsp; When I walked into the office back in 1988 it was wall to wall paper.&nbsp; Each document was manually hand-stamped and entered into the system.&nbsp; Now more than 80 percent of our documents are filed electronically. We have positioned 10 recording kiosks around the county to better serve the public and remove the necessity to drive downtown. Electronic filing also has the added benefit of making that document more readily available to the public online.&nbsp; We went back and digitized images, estimated at more than 190 million documents, as far back as 1871 (Arizona became a state in 1912).</p>
<p>One of the reasons we were able to do some of what we did was because of the Recorder’s Surcharge. Legislation had been passed before I took office to establish a surcharge fund for use on technology in the office. It was slated to sunset and we fought very hard to make it a permanent funding stream—one that doesn’t compete with other departments and that is controlled by our office.</p>
<p><strong>Tammy:</strong> Over the years&nbsp;you served&nbsp;on the EAC Advisory Board and TGDC and in many leadership roles at NACO focusing on leveraging technology to improve the services we provide to the public in a&nbsp;secure and tested fashion.&nbsp; How important is it, do you think, for such efforts to continue?</p>
<p><strong>Helen:</strong> It is incredibly important because every level of government informs the process and we have much to learn from each other.&nbsp; After 2000 and the implementation of HAVA it became very apparent that we need to have some common processes in handling election administration.&nbsp; It would be a horrendous wrong if the EAC didn’t continue.&nbsp; The voter guides and other resources particularly benefit small jurisdictions by offering assistance and have been a tremendous help in getting an election right and possibly save some money while they’re at it. We would be in a world of hurt without such an experienced body working on standards, testing, and certification. The certification program has come a long way and having testable standards is critical for election officials and the integrity of the process.</p>
<p><strong>Tammy:</strong> Your office recorded hundreds of millions of documents and counted hundreds&nbsp;of millions of ballots over your career.&nbsp; What advise can you provide to other administrators on keeping staff motivated when the workload gets hectic and the hours long&nbsp;(during candidate filing, voter registration deadlines, canvasing, etc.)?</p>
<p><strong>Helen:</strong> Did you ever feel like if you had an idea you could bring it to me?</p>
<p><strong>Tammy:</strong> Of course, your door was always open!</p>
<p><strong>Helen:</strong> The best office environment encourage staff to solve problems and have ideas about how to improve, but then also to provide the tools necessary to see that through and make it work.&nbsp; If you do that then there is a personal investment and few balk at the work load because they want it to be successful.&nbsp; You want everyone to succeed—the people you work with are like your family.</p>
<p><strong>Tammy:</strong> What do you see as the next chapter in elections, where the field is moving?</p>
<p><strong>Helen:</strong> Security of new systems will be very important.&nbsp; You want to encourage the next bright idea, but you have to be sure that the new way is safe and has integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Tammy:</strong> There are a handful of public servants like yourself who stayed in the field for a long time, past the point when colleagues retired. Why? Why did you decide to keep running?</p>
<p><strong>Helen:</strong> Quite simply, I loved my job and the people that I worked with.&nbsp; The ability to share ideas on the national level and get to that next best thing on the horizon—that was my driving force, sometimes to the detriment to my family life.&nbsp; But we all make those sacrifices for the love of the work and what it means.&nbsp;</p>

							<h2>VIP Feedback</h2>
														<p><strong>II. VIP Feedback</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where should the Voting Information Project go from here?</strong></p>
<p>As you may have heard, The Pew Charitable Trusts has initiated a planning process to determine the <a href="http://votinginfoproject.org/news/where-should-voting-information-project-go-here/">future of the Voting Information Project</a> (VIP). And as part of that process, we are seeking input from the field on what stakeholders think should be the next phase of VIP.</p>
<p>To that end, we invite you to submit your views—ideally no more than 500 words—on the following topics:</p>
<p>1) What should VIP continue to do? What should it change?</p>
<p>2) What can VIP teach about—and learn from—its efforts?</p>
<p>3) Are there other opportunities for VIP (or a project like it)?</p>
<p>4) What changes to VIP would make election officials more or less likely to participate?</p>
<p>5) What communities are currently being missed by projects like VIP, and how can we address those shortcomings?</p>
<p>6) Who else is doing work in this space, and how might VIP contribute to those efforts—and vice versa?</p>
<p>7) What other questions should we be asking?</p>
<p>The deadline for feedback is Monday, Jan. 30; please send your submissions to <a href="mailto:future@votinginfoproject.org">future@votinginfoproject.org</a>.</p>
<p>We plan to make the submissions available to the community; please let us know if you’d prefer not to be featured publicly.</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your contributions.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p>III. Election News This Week</p>
<p><strong>This week, President Donald J. Trump reiterated</strong> his <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/25/donald-trump-voter-fraud-charles-schumer-elijah-cummings/97030320/">unsubstantiated claim</a> that 3-5 million people cast illegal ballots in the November 2016 election and that he would order a full investigation into the claims. Needless to say, the <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/25/state-and-federal-election-officials-call-trump-fraud-claim-unfounded/97058026/">response</a> from elections officials at both the federal, state and local level, and both parties, was swift and unified in its opposition to the president’s claims.

<p><strong>All 15 of Arizona’s recorders have signed on to a letter</strong> to Secretary of State Michele Reagan saying that the <a href="http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2017/01/25/county-recorders-call-relationship-with-secretary-of-state-dire/">relationship between the secretary of state’s office and the local elections official is in “dire” condition</a> because state Elections Director Eric Spencer has been “ineffective and disrespectful.” According to the <em>Arizona Capitol Times</em>, the letter said Spencer has been verbally abusive, “rude” and “dismissive” of questions posted to him. Secretary of State spokesman Matt Roberts told the paper that, after Reagan received the letter, she spoke on the phone with Coconino County Recorder Patty Hansen, the president of the Arizona County Recorders Association, and that Reagan is encouraged by their conversation. “(Reagan) is going to communicate with all of the county recorders, as she has in the past,” Roberts told the paper. “And she’s excited about the opportunities we have in 2017 to work together with the recorders, as she always has.” Hansen said the phone call left her optimistic.</p>
<p><strong>What’s that they say about death and taxes?</strong> Two things seemingly no one can avoid? Well the state of Minnesota is reminding eligible residents to register to vote when <a href="http://www.inforum.com/news/4202287-eligible-minnesota-voters-can-register-vote-when-they-file-taxes-electronically">submitting their state taxes</a>. All taxpayers using Minnesota-certified electronic tax-filing software will be see a message prompting them to register to vote online at the secretary of state’s website. Approximately <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/01/24/how-to-register-to-vote-in-minnesota">700,000 eligible residents are not registered</a> and state officials are hoping this will encourage some.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of voter registration, officials in North Carolina</strong> say the <a href="http://www.wral.com/election-officials-say-they-re-registering-more-voters-through-dmv-elsewhere-/16464959/">number of residents who have registered to vote through the DMV and other state agencies doubled in 2016</a> after the state was sued for failing to comply with the National Voter Registration Act. According to the State Board of Elections, 345,000 people registered through the DMV, local social services offices and other human service agencies in 2012. In 2016, that number had risen to 715,000.</p>
<p><strong>Several Martin County, Florida government offices</strong>, including the supervisor of elections office, were <a href="http://www.wptv.com/news/region-martin-county/government-buildings-riddled-with-bullets-in-martin-county">riddled with bullets</a>. The shootings happened over a two-week period of time with the supervisor of elections office getting hit this weekend. some people at the Supervisor of Elections building had to be turned away as crews evaluated damage. &#8220;It&#8217;s concerning, of course, whenever you have a situation like that, because my building, the supervisor of elections office, is fronted with all glass windows,&#8221; said Vicki Davis, Supervisor of Elections.</p>

<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> House Bill 1014 would overturn an 1891 law that made vote-buying illegal and that modern-day administrators have said means that <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/24/colorado-repeal-ban-ballot-selfies/">ballot selfies</a> are illegal.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> The House Elections Committee has unanimously approved measures that will allow <a href="http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/23/house-panel-approves-early-voting-online-registration/96974170/">early voting</a>, online voter registration and create a study committee to come up with clearer rules for restoration of voting rights for convicts. The House passed similar early voting legislation in 2016, but it died in the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> House Bill 287, which would create a <a href="http://billingsgazette.com/news/local/bill-for-permanent-absentee-ballot-list-goes-to-committee/article_b2beaa3f-315a-5052-833c-9cecba2dff40.html">permanent absentee voter list</a>, has been referred to the House’s State Administration Committee. The legislation was written by Yellowstone County’s Election Administrator Bret Rutherford. Current law requires the absentee voter list to be deleted on Feb. 1 in even-numbered years.</p>
<p>Another bill being considered by the Legislature is House Bill 212, introduced by Rep. Jeff Essmann (R-Billings). Under the proposed legislation, a fine would be imposed on people who <a href="http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/bill-would-limit-who-can-drop-off-ballots-for-people/article_918e0ca4-1237-576b-9bdf-a1d3ad851be8.html">collect a voter’s filled-out or blank ballot</a>. The fine would be $500 per ballot. The bill makes exceptions for post office workers, elected officials, caregivers and family or members of a person&#8217;s household.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Among the several dozens of elections-related bills in the Legislature Senate Bill 47, which was requested by the secretary of state’s office, would give the office the <a href="http://www.concordmonitor.com/secretary-of-states-office-seeks-more-investigative-power-7681194">authority to conduct investigations</a> into violations of election law, enforce the rules and impose penalties.</p>
<p>Another law would prohibit gun owners from bringing their <a href="http://www.concordmonitor.com/lawmaker-introduces-bill-to-ban-guns-in-polling-places-7655512">guns to the polls</a> with them if those polling places are housed in schools.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: Bipartisan legislation and constitutional changes have been proposed that would <a href="http://www.ruidosonews.com/story/news/local/new-mexico/legislature/2017/01/23/nm-legislature-mulls-move-open-primaries/96976504/">end closed primaries</a> in New Mexico. The legislation would open up the primaries to unaffiliated voters and the constitutional amendment would create a top-two primary system.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: Citing <a href="http://www.inforum.com/news/4205110-north-dakota-house-votes-down-funding-new-election-equipment">budgetary reasons</a>, the North Dakota House has voted down two bills supported by Secretary of State Al Jaeger. One would have steered $9 million from the general fund to counties for the purchase of new voting equipment and the other would have spent $3 million to purchase e-poll books.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Rep. Wes Retherford (R-Hamilton) and Rep. Dorothy Pelanda (R-Marysville) plan to introduce legislation that would <a href="http://www.journal-news.com/news/lawmakers-try-again-eliminate-unnecessary-elections/InnAH1GKunik7HMEoErPRP/">prevent one-candidate special elections</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> State Rep. David Perryman (D-Chickasha) has introduced House Bill 1332 which would give Oklahoma voters the option of <a href="http://www.chickashanews.com/news/perryman-bill-introduces-thumb-prints-as-form-of-voter-id/article_2d78ac02-e335-11e6-8bbe-07af533a6ba9.html">registering their thumb print</a> as a form of voter ID. The thumb print would not be required, but would be an option for voters.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Rep. Tony DeLuca (D-Penn Hills) has announced that he plans to introduce legislation that would allow for <a href="https://theincline.com/2017/01/25/want-early-voting-and-same-day-registration-in-pa-so-does-this-allegheny-county-representative/">early voting</a> in the commonwealth as well as same day voter registration.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: Secretary of State Shantel Krebs testified before the House State Affairs Committee on legislation that she is proposing would set flat numbers for both partisan and independent candidates that are seeking offices in <a href="http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/legislature/number-of-nominating-signatures-needed-could-change-in-counties-with/article_60600d9a-7457-5371-a568-20ca4c513540.html">counties that operate vote centers</a>. During her testimony, Krebs noted that while vote centers work well for voters, they have presented some problems for elections officials, which is why she introduced the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> The House has approved HB12 74-0. The bill will require county clerks to quickly notify voters if their <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/home/4859585-155/after-30000-ballots-rejected-last-year">vote-by-mail ballots are spoiled</a> so they may correct the problems and cast a new ballot. It requires clerks to email or phone voters within 24 hours of rejection of a ballot if it is before Election Day, or it gives them two days to mail a letter.</p>
<p><strong>Vermont:</strong> The House Government Operations Committee heard about two days of testimony from state election officials, attorneys, current and former lawmakers, town clerks and others in a <a href="http://www.vnews.com/Vt-House-Committee-Takes-Up-Election-Challenge-7576408">disputed election decided by only seven votes</a>. The committee announced that it wants to do a <a href="https://vtdigger.org/2017/01/25/house-panel-calls-new-recount-disputed-election/">recount</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> The Senate has approved a bill that would alter <a href="http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/write-in-votes-may-be-left-nameless-if-bill-goes/article_1fedf680-e2a1-11e6-a5b2-23c0d2f99be8.html">how write-in votes are counted</a>. Under the new legislation, the threshold to actually attach names to write-in votes would raise so they would only be counted if the total of write-ins cast could mathematically alter the outcome of the election.</p>
<p>Also in Virginia, HB 1425, sponsored by Del. Mark Cole (R-Fredericksburg) would end the state’s <a href="http://wtkr.com/2017/01/24/bill-would-end-virginias-winner-take-all-electoral-vote-system/">winner-take-all system of awarding Electoral College votes</a> and instead the votes would be divided among the presidential candidates based on how many of the state’s 11 Congressional districts they win.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> Secretary of state Kim Wyman is pushing lawmakers to <a href="http://www.kentreporter.com/news/wyman-proposes-presidential-primary-date-change-other-election-reforms/">change the date of the state’s presidential primary</a> from the fourth Tuesday in May to the second Tuesday in March. She is also asking lawmakers to allow elections officials to remove candidates from the ballot if they die, withdraw or suspend their candidacy before the primary. Her proposals were introduced with bipartisan support in the House and Senate.</p>
<p>Sen Patty Kuderer has introduced legislation that would allow for <a href="http://www.kirklandreporter.com/news/kuderer-proposal-for-same-day-voter-registration-heard-in-senate-committee/">same-day voter registration</a> up until 5 p.m. on the day of a primary, special or general election. The bill would also update the online and mail-in registration deadline from 29 days prior to an election to eight days prior.</p>
<p><strong>Wyoming:</strong> The House Judiciary Committee has approved House Bill 75 which <a href="http://www.wyomingnews.com/news/wyoming-house-committee-advances-voting-rights-bill-more/article_c24fbe80-dedd-11e6-a1c0-dfcc5adca798.html">eliminates the application process for nonviolent felons</a> who have completed their sentences to regain their voting rights. The bill is supported by the League of Women Voters, and the Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>Also in Wyoming, House Bill 167 would require voters to show a government-issued <a href="http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/wyoming-voters-would-be-required-to-show-id-under-proposed/article_81398da3-640a-5edf-8586-c41beb3b82ca.html">photo ID</a> in order to cast a ballot.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VI. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> A three-judge federal court panel has <a href="http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/01/federal_judges_rule_alabama_mu.html">blocked Alabama from using in next year&#8217;s elections 12 legislative districts challenged as unconstitutional</a> by black political groups. The districts are part of the district map drawn and approved by the Republican-led Alabama Legislature after the 2010 Census and were used in the 2014 election.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> Judge Sarah Evans Barker has granted the ACLU of Indiana’s motion for summary judgement in a suit the organization brought against the state’s <a href="http://www.theindianalawyer.com/barker-rules-ballot-photo-ban-unconstitutional/PARAMS/article/42604">ballot selfie ban</a>. The ACLU argued that the law violated a voter’s First Amendment rights. “Simply put, the State has failed to establish that Indiana suffers from any substantial ongoing vote-buying problem(s) in need of the statutory protections imposed by this statute, much less any problem(s) emanating from or pertaining to the use of digital photography in facilitation vote buying.”</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> The American Civil Liberties Union wants a federal court for force Secretary of State Kris Kobach to <a href="http://www.wibw.com/content/news/ACLU-wants-federal-court-to-force-Kobach-to-turn-over-voter-registration-documents-411714565.html">turn over documents</a> he was photographed bringing to a meeting with the then-president elect. According to WIBW, some of the visible words suggest they detailed proposed changes to voter registration laws.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> The U.S. Department of Justice requested, and has received a postponement in a scheduled hearing over the state’s <a href="http://www.chron.com/local/texas-politics/texas-legislature/article/Justice-Dept-seeks-to-delay-Texas-voter-ID-10872642.php">voter ID law</a>. &#8220;Because of the change in administration, the Department of Justice also experienced a transition in leadership,&#8221; the Justice Department petition states. &#8220;The United States requires additional time to brief the new leadership of the Department on this case and the issues to be addressed at that hearing before making any representations to the Court.&#8221; The hearing has been delayed until Feb. 28. Also this week, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/voter-id-case-texas-supreme-court.html">U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal</a> from officials in the Lone Star State to restore the voter ID law. Although no reason was given, Chief Justice John Roberts did say that the court is free to consider the case after further proceedings in the lower courts.</p>
<p>Also in the Lone Star State, the Texas Civil Rights Project is asking the U.S. District Court in San Antonio to <a href="http://kut.org/post/plaintiffs-ask-court-penalize-state-officials-stalled-motor-voter-lawsuit">hold the state in contempt of court</a> for failing to hand over documents in an ongoing federal lawsuit over the state’s compliance with the Motor Voter Law.</p>
<p>In other Texas legal news, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments in the <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Appeals-court-to-hear-argument-Feb-1-in-sweeping-10883360.php">Pasadena voting rights</a> case on February 1.</p></p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p>VII. Tech Thursday</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> According to Government Technology, work to redesign the process of how residents vote in Los Angeles County is entering a critical but transformational stage after eight years of research and conceptualization. By early to mid-summer 2017, Los Angeles County hopes to have an <a href="http://www.govtech.com/products/Los-Angeles-County-Voting-System-Redesign-Enters-Solicitation-Phase.html">RFP ready for vendors</a>. The agency’s goal is to do some form of piloting of the new voting model during the 2018 midterm elections.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> This week, Secretary of State Ruth Johnson announced that the state would <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/01/24/how-to-register-to-vote-in-minnesota">purchase all new voting equipment</a> and have it in place in time for the 2018 mid-term elections. The State Administrative Board has authorized up to $82.1 million in spending over the next 10 years and approved contracts with three vendors for new tabulation machines, election-management software and long-term maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> The Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government name Virginia’s <a href="http://www.newsplex.com/content/news/Virginias-online-absentee-ballot-application-program-honored-411223825.html">online absentee ballot application system</a> one of its 2017 Bright Ideas Initiatives. During the 2016 presidential primaries, the system processed 27 percent of all absentee ballots and 62 percent of requests from voters under the age of 30.</p></p>
