							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sign of the times<br /></strong><em>Minneapolis Elections partners with local college for custom signage</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />electionlineWeekly</p>
<p>If there is one thing election workers know, it’s that necessity is the mother of invention.</p>
<p>When a member of the college staff at a polling site located at the <a href="http://mcad.edu/">Minneapolis College of Art and Design</a> (MCAD) realized that the signs provided by the city weren’t quite as helpful as they could be, the college added its own supplemental signage on polling days.</p>
<p>At the same time, Tim Schwarz, <a href="http://vote.minneapolismn.gov/">election administrator for the City of Minneapolis</a> and his colleagues were discussing an overhaul of the mandated and supplemental hodgepodge of signage there were using.</p>
<p>While there was nothing technically wrong with the information presented on the signage, Schwarz said there was a real dissonance resulting from inconsistent fonts, colors, sizes and overall readability of the signs. With the hodgepodge display of signs, it didn’t look professional and information was not being presented in an easily consumable, consistent format.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe we were getting many complaints, per se, but I honestly think most voters ignored much of the signage being thrown at them — it was just a swirl of colors and poor design on multiple, mixed-size posters,” Schwarz said.</p>
<p>Inspired by the work students at the <a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/beyond-bumper-stickers/?dept=4294967952">Rhode Island School of Design</a> were doing with election signage and seeing the materials that MCAD was producing for their on-campus polling site Schwarz said the department knew they wanted to establish some more uniformity and clean design in their own signage.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/voting-signage.jpeg" alt="voting signage" width="341" height="238" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px none #000000; float: left;" />The city partnered with MCAD’s in-house design firm, <a href="http://mcad.edu/about-mcad/hire-mcad-talent/designworks">DesignWorks</a>, which involves staff and students working with outside clients on real world design solutions, to create a whole new series of voting signage in about six months.</p>
<p>Staff at MCAD used the <a href="http://www.aiga.org/design-for-democracy">Design for Democracy</a> principles via the <a href="http://www.aiga.org/">American Institute of Graphic Arts</a> (AIGA) as their guidepost during the entire process.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.sos.state.mn.us/">Secretary of State’s Office</a> was also involved, providing feedback and information and joining meetings at key points along the way.</p>
<p>“Good civic design should be accessible to everyone. We hope that members of the design-for-good community are inspired to build upon the work MCAD has done to help create a better voting experience for citizens nationwide,” MCAD president Jay Coogan said in a statement.</p>
<p>The new signage, in multiple languages, rolled out during the 2016 election season and was well received.</p>
<p>“Reaction has been very positive,” Schwarz said. “I think we’ve heard some nice anecdotal responses from voters via the election workers. And many of our election judges have given us kudos for making the polls look more professional and providing easy to digest info for them and for the voters.”</p>
<p>The project was so well received in Minneapolis, the Secretary of State’s Office has joined the partnership and, it will be rolled out statewide in 2018. And possibly elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Once we decided to pursue this redesign, we decided it would be our goal to share the work with not only the state, but to other jurisdictions that wanted to utilize the designs, at no cost, via a creative commons license,” Schwarz said.</p>
<p>The state was already supplying a number of mandated signs to post at all polling locations, and they will continue to provide such printed signs, albeit the newly designed versions. In addition to the mandated signs the state will be printing and providing, digital files for other supplemental signs and designs are available to any other jurisdiction to access, modify and use, if they chose to do so.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Minnesota’s election system continues to be a role model for the nation, and the implementation of these improved signs with important voting information will help further ensure a consistent voting experience across the state,” Secretary of State Steve Simon said in a statement.</p>
<p>For those interested in using <a href="http://www.mcad.edu/votingsigns">Minneapolis’ files</a>, Schwarz said his office is happy to speak with anyone about it.</p>
<p>“We’re happy to speak with anyone about this project,” Schwarz said. “It’s great to be able to share and to see what others are doing across the country. We’re hopeful that this project will be useful to other elections teams out there!”</p>
<p>For those looking to go out on their own with regard to sign design, he recommends getting a copy of <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo5723477.html">Design for Democracy: Ballot and Election Design</a> by Marcia Lausen and also copies of the Center for Civic Design’s <a href="http://civicdesign.org/fieldguides/">Field Guides to Ensuring Voter Intent</a>.</p>
<p>And in the most exciting news, it is even possible to customize “I Voted” stickers right down to polling place. Yes, you read that correctly!&nbsp;<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/voting-stickers.jpeg" alt="voting stickers" width="168" height="108" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px none #000000; float: right;" /></p>
<p>“What we wanted to do was to provide the files of all the signage and the design elements to any jurisdiction to modify and use in their town/county,” Schwarz explained. “There is a stars/bars design pattern available, which is used mainly on some outdoor signage and on the wayfinding signage here in Minneapolis, and also a sticker design that could be a simple ‘I Voted’ sticker or customized for a particular poll or town or anything else!”</p>
<p>How about that? Customized “I Voted” stickers. These are heady times.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission</strong>, the <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/late-absentee-ballots-more-than-doubled-after-deadline-moved-up/article_25f50510-c2d1-5fda-b07e-30d2ec61bf27.html">number of late absentee ballots</a> not counted in the 2016 general election more than doubled from 2012 after lawmakers moved up the return deadline by three days. In 2012, there were 498 late-arriving ballots and in 2016 there were 1,208. The new deadline, used for the first time in November 2016, required that absentee ballots be received by the municipal clerk’s office by 8pm on Election Day instead of just postmarked by 8pm on Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>Although Montana’s May 25 special election</strong> <a href="http://ravallirepublic.com/news/government-and-politics/article_e2d29ce0-650c-5582-a8a8-9b0f485907c7.html">will not be an all-mail ballot affair</a>, many Montanans will cast their ballot by mail in the special election as well as the May 2 school board election, which is causing some confusion. Voters who have received their school board ballots have been calling elections boards to find out why the congressional race is not on the ballot. Missoula County Elections Coordinator is hoping some foresight she had will help. All the school board ballots have a <a href="http://newstalkkgvo.com/montana-election-administrators-deal-with-ballot-confusion-missoula-tries-new-due-by-date-stamp/">large green stamp on the front of the envelope</a> that says they are due May 2. “We saw the overlap of the two elections earlier this year and were proactive about it by making sure that the packets were color coded and also had Due By dates printed on outside of the envelope,” Connors told KGVO.</p>
<p><strong>This week, Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie M. Gorbea</strong> released a <a href="images/ETFRecommendationsReport4-27-17.pdf" class="wf_file"><span class="wf_file_text">report of election improvements</span></a> compiled by an Elections Task Force. Among the recommendations discussed were legislative initiatives such as In-Person Early Voting, Automatic Voter Registration, Post-election Audits, and clarifying the number of voting machines that the Board of Elections can allocate at each polling place. These initiatives are currently under review at the General Assembly.&nbsp;“2016 was quite an election year with the administration of three statewide elections and the implementation of new technology like online voter registration, new voting equipment and an electronic poll book pilot program,” Secretary Gorbea said. “Any time you implement something new, it’s good to debrief and discuss what worked and what didn’t go as planned. As the state’s Chief Elections Official, I convened this task force to do just that.”</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver has announced</strong> the formation a <a href="http://www.sos.state.nm.us/uploads/PressRelease/81eecdf53d2f47bdadbba752d1056ffc/20170421_NMSOS_Toulouse_Oliver_Announces_Native_American_Voting_Taskforce.pdf">Native American Voting Taskforce</a>. The taskforce will be charged with identifying ways to boost voter registration, education and election participation in tribal communities. The taskforce will include representatives from the Navajo Nation, the Jicarilla Apache Nation, the Mescalero Apache Tribe, the Fort Sill Apache Tribe, the nineteen pueblos, and a Native American who resides in an urban area. “It’s imperative that we do all we can to register New Mexico Native Americans to vote, to educate them about the timing of elections and what’s on the ballot, and to get them to the polls to vote,” said Secretary Toulouse Oliver.&nbsp; “I’m confident my Native American Voting Taskforce will generate new and creative ways to effectively engage Native voters and increase their election participation.”</p>
<p><strong>By a 3-2 vote, the St. Thomas-St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands election board</strong> voted <a href="http://stthomassource.com/content/2017/04/24/senate-president-says-courts-have-final-say-on-elections-law/">not to certify a recent special election</a> over ongoing concerns whether or not they need to decertify the losing candidate first. Senate President Myron Jackson has said that the court will have to have the final say on the election.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to Ada County, Idaho</strong> for being name a finalist in Fast Company’s <a href="http://www.mymeridianpress.com/news/ada-county-s-mobile-voting-food-truck-named-world-changing/article_e66f007a-ac4d-519e-bab8-94e213b0336f.html">2017 World Changing Ideas Awards</a> for its food-truck style mobile voting unit. “It’s not often that government is recognized for innovative ideas,&#8221; Ada County Chief Deputy Clerk Phil McGrane stated in a press release. &#8220;We appreciate being among the businesses and nonprofits that make up the list of finalists. With our successful rollout last November, we hope other jurisdictions will take up the Food Truck Voting concept and we’ll see voting expand even wider.&#8221;&nbsp;Congratulations! ElectionlineWeekly is proud to say <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2016/1995-electionlineweekly-september-22-2016">we knew you when</a>…</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> Sen. Rodger Smitherman (D-Birmingham) has introduced legislation that would allow for <a href="http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/04/bill_would_eliminate_requireme.html">no-excuse absentee voting</a> in The Yellowhammer State. While voters would not be required to provide an excuse, they would have to include a copy of their photo ID with their absentee ballot application.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Senate Bill 1307 is now before Gov. Doug Ducey that would add an extra day to the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/arizona/articles/2017-04-25/ducey-to-decide-if-voter-registration-controversy-repeats">voter registration deadline</a> if the deadline falls on a weekend or a holiday.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> The Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendment has unanimously approved a bill that would prohibit the Department of Motor Vehicles from giving the secretary of state’s office electronic information needed to complete the voter registration affidavit for ineligible voters how hold <a href="http://www.carmichaeltimes.com/articles/2017/0420-Legislation-Fix-Voter-File/index.php?ID=3507">special drivers’ licenses for noncitizens</a>.</p>
<p>Also in the Senate, the full body has approved Bill 286 that would allow voters who <a href="https://signalscv.com/2017/04/20/ballot-bill-passes-senate-floor/">lose their vote-by-mail ballot</a> or never receive it to cast a regular ballot instead of provisional one at an in-person polling place.</p>
<p>Assembly Bill 668, offered by Lorena Gonzales (D-San Diego) would more allow lawmaker to place a <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article145857829.html">$450 million voting-equipment borrowing measure</a> on the June 2018 ballot to replace many of the state’s aging voting machines.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> Gov. Eric Holcomb has signed a bill into law that <a href="http://www.tribstar.com/news/local_news/holcomb-signs-kersey-s-voter-registration-bill/article_c54d2eab-91d5-5309-ad85-8c003c9885a0.html">expands the opportunities for Indianans to get registered to vote</a>, but does not allow them to automatically get registered.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> A House committee has rejected a bill that would have <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article146903709.html">restored the voting rights</a> of 70,000 ex-felons. The committee also rejected a bill that would have put ex-felon voting rights restoration before the voters.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Largely along partisan lines, the House has vote down a requirement to show a <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2017/04/25/maine-house-rejects-requiring-voters-to-present-photo-ids/">photo ID</a> in order to cast a ballot by a 76-67 vote. According to the Portland Press Herald, the meaure will likely see some Senate action, but overall appears dead for the 2017 session.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> The Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee voted 6 to 2 to advance to the floor Legislative Resolution 1CA that asks residents if they want to put a <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/resolution-to-require-voter-id-at-nebraska-s-polls-advances/article_7b271d61-1e03-5918-9fed-69e6578beeeb.html">photo ID for voting</a> requirement in the state constitution. If approved the language will appear on the ballot in November 2018.</p>
<p>Also in Nebraska, lawmakers have approved a bill that will restore a <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/lawmakers-pass-bill-to-restore-felons-voting-rights-sooner-but/article_0eb6f49a-a585-5c35-824d-78cfa27213c1.html">felons’ right to vote</a> as soon as they have completed the terms of their sentence. Currently there is a two-year waiting period after all terms of their sentence are complete. Gov. Pete Ricketts has said he <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/ricketts-won-t-sign-bill-restoring-felons-voting-rights-sooner/article_e0ca19e6-29ec-11e7-9938-cbc9e2c2d87d.html">will not sign</a> the bill, but he did not go so far as to veto it.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> With the clock ticking, by a 12-9 vote the Senate has approved a bill that will allow voters to register and vote on the same day. The bill extends voter registration until the last day of early voting and allows <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/2017-legislature/same-day-voter-registration-gets-ok-in-nevada-senate/">same-day registration</a> at designated locations. The bill also establishes voting centers.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina:</strong> Gov. Roy Cooper (D) has vetoed a bill that would have <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article145960749.html">consolidated the state elections and ethics board</a>. On Monday, the <a href="http://www.wect.com/story/35232825/senate-overrides-coopers-veto-of-elections-board-bill-house-vote-next">Senate</a> voted 33-15 to override the veto. The <a href="http://wncn.com/2017/04/25/general-assembly-overrides-coopers-elections-board-veto/">House</a> completed the override on Tuesday.</p>
<p>This week, the North Carolina House unanimously voted to begin the process of <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article146774939.html">amending the state Constitution</a> to remove Article VI, Section 4 which says “Every person presenting himself for registration shall be able to read and write any section of the Constitution in the English language.” House Bill 148 would let voters decide the fate of the provision in a November 2018 referendum. “I don’t think I need to explain why we want to repeal it,” Republican Rep. Michael Speciale told the News &amp; Observer. “It’s a stain on North Carolina, and I just think it’s something that needs to come out of the constitution.”</p>
<p>The Senate has approved a bill from Sen. Andrew Brock (R) would <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article147013814.html">prevent voting hours from being extended</a> in a precinct where there was equipment malfunction or another problem unless every other precinct in the state stays open as well.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota:</strong> Gov. Doug Burgum (R) has signed a bill into law that <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/north-dakota/articles/2017-04-24/attorney-north-dakota-voter-law-still-unconstitutional">reworks the state’s voter ID laws</a> allowing voters who don’t have the required ID to cast a provisional ballot. An attorney for the Turtle Mountain Band of the Chippewa that is suing the state over the ID law argues that the legislative changes don’t fix the constitutional problems with the law.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Senator Frank LaRose has introduced Senate Bill 135, a supplemental appropriation bill for multiple fiscal years that would allow for the acquisition and implementation of <a href="http://www.thedailyreporteronline.com/news/2017/04/25/state-senator-revives-push-for-modern-voting-equipment/">new voting machines</a> and other elections-related equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> The Legislature has approved a measure that allows high school students who volunteer at the polls on Election Day to <a href="http://wilsonpost.com/students-now-able-to-earn-volunteer-hours-for-election-work-cms-90649">turn those hours into community service hours</a> necessary for Tennessee Scholars and Tennessee Promise scholarships.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> The McAllen City Commission has approved a measure that will allow an all-volunteer <a href="http://valleycentral.com/news/local/anticipating-500-absentee-ballots-mcallen-approves-signature-verification-committee">Signature Verification Committee</a> to review absentee ballots for the upcoming election. With more than 500 absentee ballots expected, this should save the elections office about 12 hours of work.</p>
<p>This week, the Texas House Committee on Election discussed House Bill 3425 that would decrease the number of <a href="http://www.themonitor.com/news/local/article_826e7d1c-2a26-11e7-9aa6-a7b6360a94f9.html">mail-in ballots</a> a person can handle and impose a heavier fine for those who violate the law.</p></p>

<p><strong>Florida:</strong> The state’s highest court has given the go-ahead for a proposed state constitutional amendment that would <a href="http://saintpetersblog.com/supreme-court-oks-amendments/">change the way ex-felons have their voting rights restored</a>. The Voting Restoration Amendment would restore voting rights to those with felony convictions after they complete all terms or their sentence including parole and probation.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law have filed a federal lawsuit accusing the state of <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/suit-claims-georgia-voter-registration-violates-federal-law/5boPRxoDMGhK8wM8ecSyoK/">violating federal law</a> by reducing the amount of time residents have to register to vote. The suit claims Georgia law cuts off voter registration for federal run-off elections two months earlier than guaranteed under federal law.</p>
<p>In a separate lawsuit, The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights has filed another federal lawsuit against the state claiming Georgia lawmakers violated federal <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2017-04-24/lawsuit-2015-redistricting-violated-black-voters-rights">voting rights laws</a> by moving black voters out and white voters in to two state House districts in 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Judge James O’Hara has <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article146305109.html">agreed to stay his order</a> demanding that Secretary of State Kris Kobach turn over documents he took with him to a transition meeting with then-president-elect Trump. O’Hara has stayed his order long enough for Kobach to appeal the order to U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> By a 2 to 1 vote, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has determined that a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/04/20/us/ap-us-voting-rights-texas.html?_r=0">Republican-drawn map setting the boundaries of Texas’ statehouse districts violates the Constitution</a> by intentionally discriminating against minority voters. In the ruling, federal judges round signs of racial gerrymandering and evidence that Republicans intentionally diluted the growing electoral power of minorities around Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.</p>
<p>Also in Texas, U.S. District Judge Alfred H. Bennett has said that he is considering an <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Judge-considering-special-master-to-oversee-11090806.php">independent review of Harris County’s 765 polling locations</a> to ensure they are accessible to the voters that need them. &#8220;We&#8217;re talking about something that really needs an intensive review,&#8221; the judge told the teams of lawyers in the courtroom. &#8220;There&#8217;s no blanket order I can give. We&#8217;re going to have to look at almost each of these sites or on a site-by-site basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Dallas, the Dallas County district attorney’s office is investigating <a href="http://www.wfaa.com/news/dallas-da-investigating-mail-in-ballots/433278625">complaints involving mail-in ballots</a>. According to WFAA, the Dallas County elections office has received between 50 and 100 complaints from voters about questionable mail-in ballots for the upcoming May 6 election. Toni Pippins-Poole, the Dallas County Elections Administrator, is working closely with the District Attorney’s office in the ongoing criminal investigation.</p></p>

<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> A group of <a href="https://patch.com/georgia/eastcobb/computer-experts-petition-georgia-more-transparency-voting-systems">computer experts have written to Secretary of State Brian Kemp</a> imploring him to update the state’s voting equipment.

							<h2>Electionline Underwriting</h2>
														<p><strong>XI. Electionline Underwriting</strong></p>
<p>For 15 years, electionline.org has brought you all the election administration reform news and information of the day through electionlineToday and of the week through our weekly newsletter electionlineWeekly.</p>
<p>Because of the generosity of such organizations as The Pew Charitable Trusts, Democracy Fund and the Hewlett Foundation we were able to bring you that news and information for free and free of advertising.</p>
<p>In order to continue providing you with the important news of the day and week we are now offering monthly underwriting for our daily and weekly postings (think more NPR, less local radio and television).</p>
<p>Underwriting will be available for electionlineToday, the weekly email that reaches about 4,800 inboxes each week and the weekly newsletter. Underwriting is available on a per-month basis and costs $2,500 per section per month. The underwriting is available on a first come, first-served basis. Each section will be exclusive to one underwriter per month.</p>
<p>We will accept underwriting from a variety of entities in the elections world, but will not accept political advertising.</p>
<p>Job posting and marketplace listings from elections offices seeking to sell/trade voting equipment will remain free of charge.</p>
<p>Reservations are now available. If you are interested in underwriting a section of election for a month (or more), please email us at <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">mmoretti@electionline.org</a></p>
