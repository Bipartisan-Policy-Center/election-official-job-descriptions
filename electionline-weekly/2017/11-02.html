							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>What to watch Election Day 2017</strong><br /><em>Officials use ‘off’ year to test and fine tune</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>While the focus of many Americans seems to still be on last year’s election and on the election that is still more than year away, elections officials across the country are gearing up for state and local elections next week on November 7.</p>
<p>Just because this isn’t the big show 2018 will be doesn’t mean that there isn’t plenty to keep an eye on as voters in more than half of the states will head to the polls in some capacity on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Officials that are conducting elections in 2017 are using this “off” year election cycle to test out new voting machines and poll books and fine tune policies and procedures.</p>
<p>We’ve been watching the news in the months leading up to November 3 and these are some of the stories we think are worth watching.</p>
<p><strong>New voting machines</strong><br />Like the first day of school where the smell of new books and fresh paper hangs heavy in the air, Election Day 2017 will bring the smell of new voting machines and fresh paper ballots to polling places in quite a few local jurisdictions, especially in Michigan and Virginia.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/news/2017/08/02/voting-machines-primary-election-michigan/532782001/">Michigan</a> it’s expected that cities in 50 of the state’s 83 counties will have new voting equipment in place for the general election. Some localities, like Detroit, were able to have it in place by the primary.</p>
<p>Elections officials from the secretary of state’s office to local township clerks have been busy <a href="http://grandblancview.mihomepaper.com/news/2017-11-02/Front_Page/Secretary_of_State_clerk_roll_out_new_voting_equip.html">showing the public</a> the new voting machines as well as training poll workers on the new systems.</p>
<p>“The equipment isn&#8217;t going to change the way Election Day is run, it&#8217;s just going to make it move along faster,” Huron County Clerk Lori Neal-Wonsowicz <a href="http://www.michigansthumb.com/news/article/New-voting-equipment-passes-test-runs-12312642.php">told</a> the <em>Huron Daily Tribune</em>.</p>
<p>With just less than two months to go until a gubernatorial election, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-scraps-touch-screen-voting-machines-as-election-for-governor-looms/2017/09/08/e266ead6-94fe-11e7-89fa-bb822a46da5b_story.html?utm_term=.3043a7ad9f0b">Virginia</a> State Board of Elections voted to scrap any remaining touchscreen voting machines and replace them with paper-based systems.</p>
<p>At the time of the decision, DRE machines were still in use in 22 localities. While some counties were <a href="http://www.thecoalfieldprogress.com/dickenson_star/getting-ready-for-election-day/article_a0f02716-b3bc-11e7-8d66-7b15ee652ec0.html">planning</a> on making the switch in future fiscal years, others had to scramble to find the <a href="http://wjhl.com/2017/10/25/new-voting-equipment-sets-washington-county-virginia-back-more-than-100000/">money</a> to <a href="http://wavy.com/2017/10/25/more-than-1m-spent-on-new-voting-equipment-in-norfolk/">pay</a> for the new machines, get the machines in place, train poll workers and inform the public about the new system.</p>
<p><strong>E-poll books</strong><br />Although some Ohio counties got to test run their new e-poll books during the primary, the November 2017 election will be the first “big” test of the technology. Poll workers have spent the past few weeks <a href="http://www.newsandsentinel.com/news/local-news/2017/10/washington-county-poll-workers-train-for-nov-7-election/">learning</a> the new technology.</p>
<p>Belmont County board of elections director Bill Shubat told WTOV that in addition to speeding up the process for voters, he’s looking forward to how it will make the job easier for poll workers.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s going to help in a number of ways for our poll workers to make sure that they&#8217;ve got the right number, got the right ballot,&#8221; Shubat told the station. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking for a good response, a positive response out of these machines.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Vote-by-mail</strong><br />Utah counties making the move to vote-by-mail will get another go at testing out the new-to-them system and iron out <a href="http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/utah-county-makes-changes-to-avoid-vote-by-mail-glitches/article_247978fe-9711-5385-bf85-309a79667e20.html">kinks</a> that arose during the primary process.</p>
<p>While some of the kinks from the primary may have been ironed out, the biggest challenge facing clerks now is that with just days to go before the election some counties, including Salt Lake County are reporting <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2017/10/31/dismally-slow-mail-in-and-early-voting-raises-fears-of-long-lines-for-tuesday-election-in-utah/">lower than expected turnout</a> at early voting sites and in returned mail ballots.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Salt Lake Tribune</em>, as of Monday, only 277 people had cast early ballots and only about 82,000 of the more than 446,000 mail ballots had been returned.</p>
<p>“That makes me concerned about Election Day,” County Clerk Sherrie Swenson told the paper — particularly if voters “show up and flood our polling places that are not meant for traditional polling.”</p>
<p>In 2016 the county’s election day voting centers were overwhelmed by the turnout and voters waited in lines for hours.</p>
<p><strong>Ranked choice voting</strong><br />Ranked choice voting will make its third appearance in the City of Minneapolis and this year there have been some rule changes to hopefully help speed up the process.</p>
<p>“We are going to have <a href="http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2017/11/01/minneapolis-mayor-election-results-process/">batch eliminations</a>, which we didn’t have in 2013, and that means we can eliminate more candidates in a single round, which expedites our tabulation and we can report results faster,” Minneapolis City Clerk Casey Carl told WCCO.</p>
<p>Some voters told the <em>Spokesman-Recorder</em> that they are still unaware of the ranked-choice voting system. Carl told the paper that her office spent much of the summer doing outreach, not only English, but also Spanish, Somali and Hmong.</p>
<p>“We made the effort, but the question is did people get it. We called newspapers and put out press releases. We put it on our web site. We went to neighborhood groups and did presentations. We had a voter outreach team that went out to the community all summer long to [talk] about Ranked Choice Voting (RCV),” he <a href="http://spokesman-recorder.com/2017/10/31/election-nears-many-voters-seem-confused-ill-informed/">told</a> the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Weather</strong><br /><strong>Mother</strong> Nature always has a potential to play a role on Election Day, but it’s weather that happened before Election Day that will for sure be impacting this year’s contests.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Harvey-ruined-county-polling-places-12254212.php">Houston</a>, the clerk’s office has encouraged as many people to vote early as possible and to vote-by-mail because it is unclear how many traditional polling places will be available following the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Irma.</p>
<p>Wildfires that raged through Northern California’s wine country are also having an impact on November elections. In <a href="http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/local/7555821-181/sonoma-countys-november-election-will">Sonoma County</a>, the county will conduct an all vote-by-mail election due to damage to polling places.</p>
<p><strong>Key races</strong><br />While there are quite a few county clerk races on the ballot next week, the two “big ticket” races are the Detroit clerk’s race and the New Jersey lieutenant governor’s race.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2017/08/08/detroit-city-clerk-garlin-gilchrist-janice-winfrey/549983001/">Detroit</a>, longtime City Clerk <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Janice_Winfrey">Janice Winfrey</a> is being challenged by new comer <a href="https://www.gilchristforcityclerk.com/">Garlin Gilchrist</a>, a University of Michigan-educated computer science engineer who previously worked in the mayor’s office helping to build better efficiency and accountability systems for the city government as the city’s first Director of Innovation &amp; Emerging Technology.</p>
<p>In the most <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2017/10/27/mike-duggan-coleman-young-detroit/807635001/">recent poll</a> from the <em>Detroit Free Press</em>, Winfrey holds a 42 percent to 35 percent lead over Gilchrist with 23 percent of the voters still undecided. Gilchrist has earned the endorsement of several newspapers in Detroit.</p>
<p>In New Jersey current Lt. Governor Kim Guandagno (R) is running against Democrat Phil Murphy who is a former ambassador. Guandango’s running make is Woodcliff Lake Mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Rendo">Carlos Rendo</a>. Murphy’s running mate is Former State Assembly Speaker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Oliver">Shelia Oliver</a>.</p>

<p>The Government Accountability Office confirmed that it will <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/26/gao-trump-voter-fraud-commission-244209">launch an investigation</a> into the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. According to Politico, GAO said it would investigate the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in response to a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/361958692/Letter-to-the-GAO-Re-Election-Integrity-Commission" target="_blank">letter</a> last week from Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colorado), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) and Cory Booker (D-New Jersey). In a response letter, the agency accepted the request &#8220;as work that is within the scope of its authority.&#8221; The investigation should begin in about five months when the GAO has staff to dedicate to it.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Secretary of State William Gardner (D), a member of the presidential commission said last week that <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/nh-primary-source-gardner-says-trump-election-commission-staff-overwhelmed/13095347">he has not heard from commission staff</a> since a September 12 meeting.</p>
<p>“They’re dealing with a number of lawsuits,” Gardner told New Hampshire Primary Source. “The Justice Department and the staff down there have asked us to send them anything we have, even notes.”</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>This week, the Alaska Division of elections sent out</strong> a mailer to 75,000 Alaskans asking whether they want to <a href="http://juneauempire.com/state/news/2017-11-01/pfd-voter-program-sends-first-mailers-week">opt-out of the state’s new automatic voter registration program</a>. Unlike other AVR states, Alaskans are automatically registered if they receive payments from the Permanent Fund Dividend. The state compares the voter registration database to the PFD database and then registers people or updates addresses. Residents have 30 days to respond to the mailers. Director of the Division of Elections Josie Bahnke said about 25,000 people have been added to the voter rolls and the information for 50,000 has been updated.</p>
<p><strong>A new study from Yale University published in</strong> <em><strong>Political Behavior </strong></em>confirms prior research that <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/10/171031120316.htm">those who vote are less likely to be convicted of crimes</a> than non-voters, but it also shows that voting alone does not directly reduce criminality. &#8220;While voting is a worthy activity, it does not appear to prevent people from committing crimes or set them on a virtuous path toward good citizenship,&#8221; said Gregory A. Huber, professor of political science at Yale University and a co-author of the study. &#8220;This does not mean that participatory democracy has no positive transformative effects on people, but it suggests that scholars should reconsider whether the simple act of voting or other civic engagement is sufficient to promote other pro-social behaviors.&#8221; Overall, study subjects who voted in November 2010 were 55 percent less likely to be under state supervision &#8212; incarceration, parole, or probation &#8212; two years after the election than those who did not vote.</p>
<p><strong>In 2016, the California Secretary of State’s office and the University of California system</strong> signed a memorandum of understanding with the university system committing to working to <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2017/10/29/uc-to-create-online-voting-portals-centralized-polling-stations/">make it easier for students to register and vote</a>. UC Student Regent Paul Monge told the <em>Daily Bruin</em> several student groups, are working with the university to implement the recommendations by the 2018 congressional elections. Some elements of the plan include creating an online voter registration portal that will automatically populate voter registration forms with student information, centralized polling places on campus and one university office that will be responsible for student voter engagement. “With the 2018 elections coming up, we want to have strong systems in place and we should have confidence in people getting registered and engaged,” Devon Graves, UC student regent-designate told the paper. “This is an important piece of a much bigger picture.”</p>

<p><strong>Our good friend Jamal was famous for saying</strong> that the same things that make you laugh will make you cry so we were happy to see that the folks in the Colorado secretary of state’s office were able to <a href="http://www.9news.com/news/local/next/theyve-got-jokes-at-the-colorado-secretary-of-states-office-this-halloween/487762270">find some humor in an issue</a> many of us have been “crying” about.

She was always waiting for him when he returned home from the University of Minnesota or one of his many elections-related trips.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Martin Heinrich (D-New Mexico) have introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at protecting the nation’s election security. The Security America’s Voting Equipment (SAVE) Act, would codify the Department of Homeland Security’s critical infrastructure designation and provide optional resources for states.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> A House panel has approved a bill that will allow Florida to join an <a href="http://wusfnews.wusf.usf.edu/post/veteran-id-voter-info-measures-one-stop-house-floor#stream/0">interstate voter registration database</a>. The bill also prohibits the state from joining any program operated by the federal government or on its behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Guam:</strong> Bill 45-34 that would <a href="https://www.postguam.com/news/local/primary-election-bill-sent-back-to-committee/article_a9645db2-bae3-11e7-b382-9bbd4a67c368.html">eliminate primary elections</a> on Guam has been sent back to committee in order to resolve issues that were raised by the full Legislature.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> The House Elections and Ethics Committee has approved a bill that would require “aggrieved candidates” to show that they could have won the election if not for voter fraud or error, otherwise they would not be able to <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/26/panel-approves-jill-stein-recount-rules/107037418/">initiate a recount</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> The Missoula Board of County Commissioners voted 3 to 0 to keep the county’s <a href="http://missoulian.com/news/local/commissioners-will-continue-to-appoint-elections-administrator/article_7ecb294e-bb1c-564d-8dab-43680c315909.html">elections administrator as an appointed position</a>. The decision comes three years after the board decided to create the elections administrator position, breaking elections away from the clerk’s duties.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Under proposed legislation, the secretary of state will have the authority to <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/state-government/Bill-gives-state-power-to-postpone-local-elections-10312017">postpone and reschedule elections</a> under extreme weather conditions.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Lawmakers in New Jersey held a hearing last week about the security of the state’s 11,000 voting machines. According to WHYY, lawmakers are considering legislation that would require <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/n-j-replace-thousands-aging-voting-machines/">new voting machines</a> have a paper record of each vote cast that would be preserved for use in any audits of election results. They haven’t determined whether the legislation would require all of the voting machines to be replaced by a certain date, be purchased when counties need replacements, or whether the state will provide the funding.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> State Sen. Pat Stefano (R-Fayette County) has sponsored a bill that would allow members of the military and state residents who are overseas to <a href="http://www.readingeagle.com/news/article/bill-would-allow-pennsylvania-soldiers-to-vote-online&amp;template=mobileart">cast their absentee ballots electronically</a>. The bill was approved by the Senate State Government Committee and now goes to the full Senate.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: The state board of elections has endorsed draft legislation for 2018 that would <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/south-dakota/articles/2017-10-30/elections-board-endorses-electronic-voting-system-law-change">remove references to electronic voting machines</a> from state law.

According to <em>The Miami Herald</em>, Denise Galvez Turros had sought to place her name first on the ballot ahead of Manuel “Manolo” Reyes and Ralph Rosado. In a complaint filed this month after absentee ballots began to go out, she argued that the supervisor of elections and Miami city clerk had wrongly considered her surname to be Turros, resulting in her third-ranked placement on the ballot due to alphabetical ordering.</p>
