							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Get them while they’re young</strong><br /><em>California 16- and17-year-olds can now pre-register online</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>electionline.org</p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/teens-social-media-technology-2015/">study</a> by the Pew Research Center, 92 percent of teens report going online daily — including 24 percent who say they go online “almost constantly.”</p>
<p>With that in mind, California is bringing Muhammad to the mountain by allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote using the state’s <a href="http://registertovote.ca.gov/">online voter registration portal</a>.</p>
<p>“Online pre-registration will help more young people vote as soon as they are eligible. Whether they’re at school or at home or hanging out with friends, young Californians can pre-register to vote in just minutes in their smartphone, tablet or laptop,” said <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/">Secretary of State Alex Padilla</a>.</p>
<p>California is one of <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/preregistration-for-young-voters.aspx">10 states and the District of Columbia</a> that allows 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote and also one of <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-or-online-voter-registration.aspx">34 states and the District of Columbia</a> that allows people to register online to vote. As far as we know, it’s the only state that allows those pre-registrants to use the online portal. [Update: Massachusetts and Utah also allow pre-registrants to do so online. Thanks to our alert readers for letting us know!]</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/CA_pre_reg.jpg" alt="CA pre reg" width="491" height="491" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px none #000000; float: left;" />In 2014, Governor Jerry Brown signed <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB113">Senate Bill 113</a> by Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) which allowed voter pre-registration beginning at age 16 once the California’s statewide voter registration database, VoteCal, was certified.</p>
<p>Pre-registration has been offered on paper voter registration forms since VoteCal was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/administration/news-releases-and-advisories/2016-news-releases-and-advisories/secretary-state-padilla-certifies-votecal-statewide-voter-registration-database/">certified in September 2016</a>. Technical upgrades to California&#8217;s online voter registration system were required before&nbsp;online&nbsp;pre-registration could be offered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there were no additional costs to the state to make this switch, there were some programming changes to VoteCal and the OVR system that needed to be made in order to handle the pre-registrants.</p>
<p>Any 16- and 17-year-old that is eligible to vote (U.S. citizen, California resident, not in jail or on parole, etc.) is eligible to use the online system. If the registrant doesn’t have a signature on file with the state’s DMV — either through a driver’s license or state ID card — will need to complete the process online, then print a form, sign it and send it to their county elections office.</p>
<p>To avoid any confusion like what was reported this week in <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/ap/state/dozens-of--year-olds-voted-illegally-in-wisconsin-primary/article_6be50f8b-0052-507f-b784-db44cca7c2a8.html">Wisconsin</a>, county elections offices will mail confirmation post-cards to those who are pre-registered as soon as they turn 18 to notify them that they are now eligible to vote.</p>
<p>Pre-registrants can use the online portal on any smart phone, tablet or computer and they can use the portal the same way registered voters do to update addresses.</p>
<p>The state launched their “Pre-Register at 16, Vote at 18” campaign at Los Angeles-area high school and plans to work with civic engagement organizations, elected officials, school districts and education groups to get the work out about the new online opportunity. They will of course rely heavily on social media outreach too.</p>
<p>“We are also planning to contact teachers who have participated in our Mock Election program. We will continue to promote the ‘Pre-Register at 16, Vote at 18’ campaign during California’s high school voter education weeks, National Voter Registration Day, and support legislation to include pre-registration in the high school curriculum,” said Sam Mahood, press secretary for the secretary of state’s office</p>
<p>As of the week of the launch, there were 15,430 pre-registrants in California. Only time will tell how much that number grows.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>There were <a href="http://www.nh1.com/news/to-vote-or-not-to-vote-blizzard-2017-delays-scores-of-town-elections-across-nh/">two storms brewing</a> in New Hampshire this week.</strong> While snow, sleet and wind pounded the Granite State some local clerks were at odds with the secretary of state and the governor when they chose to cancel town elections because they were scheduled for Tuesday during the height of the late-winter blizzard. A lawyer for the New Hampshire Municipal Association said the <a href="http://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20170315/blizzard-reveals-local-election-law-confusion">towns have the authority to make the decision themselves</a> to postpone elections while the secretary of state’s office insisted that voting could not be postponed. &#8220;There is some differing opinion on the state level as to &#8230; whether that is a valid process for them to take,&#8221; Gov. Chris Sununu told SeacoastOnline. &#8220;Given that there are differing opinions, the best we can do is <a href="http://www.whav.net/cms/sununu-n-h-towns-that-postponed-local-elections-took-risk/">strongly recommend that all towns stay open for voting</a>….&#8221; Numerous town postponed their elections till later this week and through the weekend, but some did remain open for voting and for those that did, <a href="http://www.vnews.com/Voters-Brave-Winter-Storm-on-Town-Meeting-Day-8676060">voters arrived any way they could</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Kids grow up so fast these days</strong> and last election season in Wisconsin, <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/ap/state/dozens-of--year-olds-voted-illegally-in-wisconsin-primary/article_6be50f8b-0052-507f-b784-db44cca7c2a8.html">a few 17-year-olds took that just a step too far</a> by casting ballots in the primary election although they were not eligible. While some states do allow 17-year-olds who will be 18 at the time of the general election vote in the primary, Wisconsin is not one of those states. According to a report from the Wisconsin Elections Commission, at least 60 17-year-olds voted. Reid Magney, spokesman for the commission told the Wisconsin State Journal that he’d never seen this issue crop up before and believes that the teens were likely encouraged to go to the polls by messages on social media. The cases have been referred to local prosecutors but it is unclear if they will result in any <a href="http://www.leadertelegram.com/News/Front-Page/2017/03/16/lt-div-class-libPageBodyLinebreak-gt-Prosecution-doubtful-of-area-17-year-old-voters-lt-div-gt.html">prosecutions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A report by the Kansas Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights</strong> says that the state’s <a href="http://kcur.org/post/report-kansas-election-law-suppressing-turnout#stream/0">proof-of-citizenship requirement and voter ID law “may impose substantially higher burden</a> than that which has been previously challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court.” The advisory committee report says that research has found that stricter ID and registration requirements can suppress voter participation. It goes on to say that a preliminary analysis of Kansas turnout data “suggests that voter participation declined following the implementation of the SAFE Act.”</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate </strong>who won the <a href="http://www.businessrecord.com/Content/Default/-All-Latest-News/Article/Pate-wins-national-education-award/-3/248/76933">National State Boards of Education Award for Outstanding Leadership in Voter Education</a>. Pate was recognized for his efforts in conducting two statewide Iowa Youth Straw Polls and the Iowa Youth Caucus. “Our congratulations to Secretary Pate and his staff on their hard work teaching the next generation to carry the torch of liberty,” Gloria Kirshner, president of National Student/Parent Mock Election organization said in a statment.&nbsp;“Our mission is&nbsp;to light a fire in the hearts of our young, empowering them to preserve and protect government of the people, by the people and for the people for generations to come, and Secretary Pate’s efforts in Iowa align perfectly with that mission.” The Iowa Youth Straw Polls were the culmination of Caucus 101 and Elections 101. Those are free, online, social studies curricula developed by Secretary Pate and written by Iowa teachers for Iowa students. They are available for anyone to use at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elections101.org/">Elections101.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The John S. and James L. Knight foundation this week announced</strong> <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/press/releases/two-projects-will-help-increase-voter-engagement-through-technology-with-3-million-from-knight-foundation">renewed support to two separate nonprofit organizations</a> — Democracy Works&nbsp;and the Center for Technology and Civic Life — to help increase voter participation in elections and break down barriers to civic engagement through technology. Democracy Works will receive $2.5 million to expand its work in college and corporate outreach as well as expand its work with election officials by launching the Election Technology Cooperative. The Center for Technology and Civic Life will receive a grant for $508,000 to continue CTCL’s work in training municipal officials to use digital tools for community outreach and elections planning.</p>
<p><strong>And our sympathies to <a href="http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2017/03/06/1959-Corvette-gets-car-parked-on-it-at-Florida-Walmart/4391488809570/">Charlotte County, Florida Supervisor of Elections Paul Stamoulis</a></strong>. As reported by UPI a driver “cutting through” a Florida Wal-Mart parking lot accidentally hit the gas instead of the brake and her car ended up atop Stamoulis’ classic 1959 Corvette. The story notes that Stamoulis remained calm throughout the ordeal and if that’s case, we’re pretty convinced he must be downright stoic on an election night. Here’s hoping it’s not a complete loss.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> The House has voted unanimously for a bill that would define what criminal convictions should disqualify a person from voting. The bill names 42 crimes ranging from murder to forgery as <a href="http://abc3340.com/news/local/alabama-house-lists-crimes-that-forfeit-voting-rights">crimes of moral turpitude</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> The Senate as approved a bill that expands the list of places people may <a href="http://www.swtimes.com/news/20170310/arkansas-senate-oks-bill-to-expand-places-guns-allowed">carry a concealed handgun</a> including polling places. The bill had stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee, but the Senate approved a motion to bring it before the full body.</p>
<p><strong>Delaware:</strong> Rep. Earl Jaques (D-Glasgow) is trying again to remove language from the state constitution that requires voters to show a valid <a href="http://delawarepublic.org/post/bill-would-ease-restrictions-absentee-ballots-delaware">excuse for obtaining an absentee ballot</a>. Because it’s a constitutional change it will require 2/3 of the General Assembly to approve it in two consecutive years.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> A bill that would allow voters <a href="http://floridapolitics.com/archives/233596-vote-by-mail-ballots">to fix mismatching signatures</a> on their vote-by-mail ballot has cleared the House Government Accountability Committee by a unanimous vote. The bill now heads to the full House. There is no Senate companion bill at this time.</p>
<p>The House Oversight, Transparency &amp; Administration Subcommittee voted unanimously to approve HJR 811 that would place the issue of whether or not the <a href="http://www.news4jax.com/news/elected-secretary-of-state-gets-backing">state’s top elections official</a> should be elected or appointed by the governor as is currently the case.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho:</strong> Legislation to change Idaho’s procedure for <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/mar/13/idaho-bill-to-clamp-down-on-special-house-election/">special elections</a> when an Idaho member of Congress leaves office mid-term cleared a Senate panel on Monday, and headed to the full Senate. Under the bill, there would be both a primary election and a general election. When a vacancy occurs, the governor would have to pick one of the four existing Idaho election dates for the primary.</p>
<p>A bill that would limit <a href="http://www.localnews8.com/news/bill-limiting-early-voting-dies-in-idaho-senate/397574685">early voting</a> in Idaho has died in the Senate State Affairs Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> Lawmakers in the Senate are moving Senate Bill 1933, a new version of <a href="http://www.lincolncourier.com/news/20170315/state-lawmakers-revive-automatic-voter-registration-push">automatic voter registration</a>. If approved, and signed by the governor, it would take effect July 1, 2018. Under this new bill, qualified residents would automatically be registered to vote when they visit the Illinois Secretary of State and other state agencies for services. Additionally, there would be checks in place to ensure no one is registered to vote who should not be.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> The House has approved Secretary of State Paul Pate’s <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/09/iowa-house-approves-voter-id-bill-following-12-hours-debate/98950160/">election integrity bill</a> which would in addition to other things, require a voter to show a photo ID (or a state-issued voter registration card which will be automatically provided to those without a driver&#8217;s license or non-driver&#8217;s ID) in order to cast a ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Members of the House Elections Committee tacked an amendment onto a Senate bill that proponents say would make election offices in the state’s largest counties accountable to the people they serve. The local elections officials would be <a href="http://cjonline.com/news/state-government/local/2017-03-15/house-members-seek-strip-kobach-power-appoint-election">elected positions instead of appointed by the secretary of state</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> A Missouri bill would require the Department of Health and Senior Services to create a system notifying election authorities when someone has died therefore permitting them to <a href="http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/politics/reisch-backs-legislation-targeting-voter-rolls/article_1262d15a-4173-55ae-b50d-1c3c51c53b30.html">take the dead person off the voter rolls</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> As counties <a href="http://www.nbcmontana.com/news/keci/choosing-the-best-unlimited-data-plan/395333280">continue to prepare</a> for the May 25 special election how they replace Secretary Zinke remains up in the air. <a href="http://mtpr.org/post/mail-voting-bill-sent-kill-committee">Senate Bill 305</a>, which would allow counties to conduct the election by mail has been sent a committee that Sen. Steve Fitzpatrick (R-Great Falls) calls the kill committee. Fitzpatrick said the House Judiciary Committee has some of the most ideological representatives. The committee and full House have about two weeks to approve the bill and get it to the governor for his signature.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> The secretary of state’s office and the Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles testified against proposed legislation that would create a system of <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/nebraska-election-dmv-officials-testify-against-bill-that-would-make/article_d0c71154-abab-5f37-b5c6-3af15d612045.html">automatic voter registration</a> in Nebraska. Colleen Byelick, general counsel and chief deputy for the Secretary of State’s Office argued that AVR would flood the state’s voter rolls with ineligible voters.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> By a 12-9 party-line vote, the Nevada Senate has approved legislation that would allow residents to be <a href="http://kunr.org/post/nevada-could-become-7th-state-approve-automatic-voter-registration#stream/0">automatically registered to vote</a> when getting a new or renewing their license. It is unclear whether or not <a href="http://www.nevadaappeal.com/news/government/sandoval-may-veto-nevada-voter-registration-petition/">Gov. Sandoval</a> will sign the bill.</p>
<p>Also in Nevada, lawmakers are consider a bill to amend the state’s constitution to make it <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2017/mar/14/lawmakers-want-voter-protections-included-in-nevad/">unconstitutional to intimidate a voter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire:</strong> On a party-line vote the Senate killed a bill that would have allowed for <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/new-hampshire-senate-votes-down-online-voter-registration-bill#stream/0">online voter registration</a> in the Granite State. Arguments against the bill included that it would have been too expensive to implement.</p>
<p>Also in New Hampshire, the Senate has approved a bill to allow towns and cities to participate in an <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20170309/NEWS0621/170319999/0/NEWS03">e-poll book trial</a> program.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey:</strong> A bill has been introduced to the Assembly that would require all new voting machines purchased or leased to <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/bill_would_require_paper_trail_for_nj_voting_machi.html">produce a paper record</a> of each vote cast.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico:</strong> A bill that would have allowed someone to register to vote up to three days before an election has been killed in a Senate committee. The <a href="http://nmpolitics.net/index/2017/03/bill-to-allow-voter-registration-during-early-voting-dies/">voter registration deadline</a> in the Land of Enchantment will remain 28 days prior to an election.</p>
<p>Also in New Mexico, an amendment to House Bill 174 that would <a href="http://nmpolitics.net/index/2017/03/compromise-with-cities-moves-bill-to-consolidate-elections-forward/">consolidate most local elections</a> into one would now allow cities to opt out and continue to hold their own election.</p>
<p>By a 9-4 vote the House Judiciary Committee has rejected House Bill 206 which would have <a href="http://www.taosnews.com/stories/committee-tables-bill-to-open-primary-elections,39295">opened the state’s primaries</a> to independent voters.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> A bipartisan bill — House Bill 2731 — has been introduced to include Oregon in the <a href="http://katu.com/news/politics/oregon-mulls-joining-national-popular-vote-movement">National Popular Vote inter-state compact</a>. Legislation has been introduced before, 2009, 2013 and 2015, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina:</strong> Sen. Mike Fanning has proposed legislation that would require any elected official who is convicted of a crime and must resign their seat to <a href="http://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article137810213.html">pay for the special election</a> to fill that seat. The proposal would require solicitors to ask for that restitution, and it would authorize judges to order it.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> The Senate Affairs Committee voted 7-0 to send Senate Bill 5 to the full body. The bill would add options to voters who say they cannot “reasonably” obtain one of the seven forms of <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/03/13/senate-committee-approves-texas-voter-id-overhaul/">acceptable ID</a>. It would also allow voters over 70 to show an expired license as ID.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) has vetoed House Bill 1428 that would have required any voter submitting an application for an absentee ballot by mail or by fax to also submit a photo copy of their valid <a href="http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/politics/mcauliffe-vetoes-bill-on-photo-id-for-absentee-ballots/article_45e8288c-052f-11e7-a497-eb258985cf4c.html">photo ID</a>.</p>
<p>McAuliffe has also vetoed a bill (HB 2343) that would have required the state Department of Elections to <a href="http://wric.com/2017/03/15/mcauliffe-vetoes-bills-he-says-could-restrict-voting-rights/">provide local registrars with a list of voters</a> who, according to data-matching systems, have been found to be registered in another state. “This bill would invite confusion and increase the possibility of violating federal law,” McAuliffe said in his veto statement. “Moreover, it would expose eligible and properly registered Virginians to the risk of improper disenfranchisement.”</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> Legislators are considering a bill that would change the <a href="http://www.columbiabasinherald.com/article/20170315/ARTICLE/170319957">voter registration deadline</a> to 11 days prior to an election instead of the current 29 days.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> Elbert Melton, 69 Mayor of Gordon has been arrested on <a href="http://www.dothaneagle.com/news/crime_court/gordon-mayor-elbert-melton-arrested-on-voter-fraud-charges/article_0db30c4e-0925-11e7-b45d-9bb274a05c54.html">three counts of absentee voter fraud</a>, a class C felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. He won his election by 16 votes.</p>
<p>California: In a report entitled “No Voter Fraud Here: The Transparent Election Process,” an Orange County grand jury says it conducted a <a href="http://voiceofoc.org/2017/03/grand-jury-finds-no-signs-of-major-voter-fraud-in-orange-county/">thorough review of the local voting system</a> and found no signs of significant fraud in the recent election.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> A suit has been filed against Gov. Rick Scott (R) and three elected cabinet members by the Fair Elections Legal Network on behalf of seven ex-felons. The suit seeks to end Florida’s <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/federal-lawsuit-challenges-arbitrary-florida-clemency-system/2316426">“unconstitutionally arbitrary” system for restoring the civil rights of convicted felons</a>. The lawsuit says 1.6 million Floridians are currently disenfranchised, the most of any state, and that more than 10,000 are awaiting public hearings on their restoration applications.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> Steveland Kidd, 29 of Alorton has plead guilty to <a href="http://www.bnd.com/news/local/article138195003.html">voter fraud charges</a> in the April 2013 election. He was charged with two counts of violating absentee ballots. He was sentenced to 12 days in county jail and is barred from electioneering or campaign activities.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> State District Judge Tim Kelly has ruled that more than 700,000 Louisiana residents on probation or parole for felony crimes will <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/louisiana/articles/2017-03-13/judge-felons-on-probation-parole-cant-vote-in-louisiana">remain disenfranchised</a>. Kelley called it unfair to keep thousands of people from voting if they&#8217;re working, paying taxes and following the law. But he said Louisiana&#8217;s constitution and a four-decades-old state law required him to continue denying the voting rights. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this ruling. I don&#8217;t like it. It&#8217;s not fair,&#8221; Kelley said via the <em>Associated Press</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Under a court-ordered agreement, the state of Nevada and Washoe and Mineral counties have agreed to pay <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/nevada/articles/2017-03-09/nevada-tribes-win-60k-in-legal-fees-in-voting-rights-fight">$60,000 in legal fees</a> to the Pyramid Lake and Walker River Paiute tribes. The tribes won a federal lawsuit against the state and counties to provide early voting to the tribes.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> In a 2-1 ruling a panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that Republicans redrew Texas’ congressional map to <a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/court-voids-texas-congressional-districts/FJoxFl3QTJxL1PAqYnMKoO/">intentionally discriminate against</a> Latino and black voters.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Walter Mason, mayor of Waverly, has been indicted on <a href="http://www.nbc12.com/story/34900292/waverly-mayor-indicted-on-election-fraud-charges">12 counts of felony election fraud</a>. According to the indictments,&nbsp;Mason &#8220;unlawfully and feloniously, willfully make a false statement or entry on an absentee ballot application,&#8221; four different times between February and April of 2016. He is also accused of helping seven people &#8220;in a violation of absentee voting procedures.&#8221;</p></p>

<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> A group of 20 technology experts have written a letter to Secretary of State Brian Kemp urging that, following a suspected data breach, the state should stop using electronic voting machines and should switch to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2017-03-14/advocates-call-for-paper-ballots-in-georgia-amid-fbi-review">paper-based balloting</a>.

<p><strong>New York</strong>: The New York City board of elections is seeking $1.3 million from the city council to upgrade cybersecurity measures.
