							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stamp of approval</strong><br /><em>Turnout increases under King Co. pre-paid return postage pilot</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>electionline.org</p>
<p>If you build it they will come, but if you put a stamp on it will they vote?</p>
<p>Signs point to yes, at least as was discovered during a recent pilot in <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/elections.aspx">King County, Washington</a> where voter turnout was higher than expected for a special election that featured pre-paid return postage on mail ballots.</p>
<p>Based on previous turnouts, the county predicted about a 30 percent turnout for each of the two jurisdictions participating in the special election, however turnout was 37 percent in one jurisdiction and 40 percent in the other.</p>
<p>“I’m excited to see increased participation,” Julie Wise, King County elections director said in a statement. “When I was elected, one of my commitments was to remove barriers to voting. As we increase access with pre-paid postage and ballot drop boxes, we’re beginning to see a real impact.”</p>
<p>The special election was chosen because it provided small, discrete sample populations.</p>
<p>“Ideally with more than one jurisdiction participating, we also wanted to gain an understanding of whether or not there are significant differences between jurisdictions,” explained Kafia Hosh, communications specialist for the county.</p>
<p>Pre-paid postage can be done two different ways either through Business Reply Mail in which the county only pays for the ballots that are actually returned or with pre-paid postage where the sufficient postage is attached to all ballots and the county pays whether the ballots are returned or not.</p>
<p>King County chose the Business Replay Mail route and postage for the test cost King County $10,140. There were some additional one-time tasks to set up a new business reply mail account, design updated envelope artwork and establish a few new data collection procedures. There were no added steps to the actual processing of ballots.</p>
<p>The elections department used money already in its budget for the postage.</p>
<p>Tammy Patrick with the <a href="http://bipartisanpolicy.org/">Bipartisan Policy Center</a> said there are several advantages to pre-paid return postage for ballots.</p>
<p>“Postage can vary from one election to the next depending on the length of the ballot, how many ballot cards are used, the number of inserts, etc.,” Patrick said. “One benefit to prepaying is that the appropriate postage is affixed. Jurisdictions not paying for the return postage are required to notify the voter what the postage will be for each election unless they have an overage account to pay for any ballots lacking sufficient postage.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/">Secretary of State Kim Wyman</a> said her office is supportive of any effort to engage the electorate, but there are some reservations about only one county using pre-paid postage because the secretary of state’s office prefers all counties to be consistent in their policies and procedures to avoid voter confusion. Still she was encouraged by the King County pilot.</p>
<p>“There are logistical questions about how the USPS will process pre-paid return ballot envelopes that need to be answered and the King County pilot was instructive about that process,” Wyman said. “Our staff is also working directly with the USPS to better understand how the logistics would work, as well as with U.S. Representative Denny Heck’s office to explore possible federal solutions that might help us implement pre-paid return ballot envelopes statewide. The King County pilot was helpful and we will be closely monitoring their second pilot on this issue in April.”</p>
<p>Because the King County is diverse, both in terms of constituents and geography, Hosh said the April test will be important to show what pre-paid postage looks like in a variety of situations.</p>
<p>“We want to study the outcomes in different elections before making any decisions about permanently implementing pre-paid postage,” Hosh said. “We would also need to work with the King County Council and our local jurisdictions to figure out if this is something we want to fund on an on-going basis.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If legislation currently being considered is successful pre-paid postage could go statewide. Under <a href="http://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=5019&amp;Year=2017">SB-5019-2017-18</a> the state would reimburse counties for the cost of pre-paid postage.</p>
<p>“Our testimony was supportive with the request that the bill be amended to include all elections,” Wyman said. “The bill was subsequently amended to include all elections and we support the language of the substitute bill.”</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Montgomery County, North Carolina’s board of elections</strong> <a href="http://www.courier-tribune.com/news/20170224/confederate-flag-issue-results-in-polling-place-change">needs to find a new polling location</a> after the state board of elections told the county it could no longer use the Uwharrie Fire Department because the department flies a Confederate flag above the station. Since the county has no authority to have the flag removed they will need to find a new polling place. According to the <em>Courier-Tribune</em>, the flag became an issue during the 2016 general election when a poll worker declined to work at the Uwharrie Fire Department because she was offended by the flag over the polling place. In the past, the fire department would take the flag down on voting days, but refused to continue that practice. “We are researching other options for the Uwharrie precinct and will have this resolved for voters by the next election,” Amy Robert, director of elections said. “We respect their right to do as they wish on their property, but we cannot have a polling place there. A new place to vote is our only concern now.”</p>
<p><strong>A group of Democratic senators</strong> are <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/321014-senators-ask-feds-for-full-account-of-work-to-secure-election-from-cyber">asking the U.S. Election Assistance Commission for a “full account”</a> of its work to secure the 2016 election from Russian hackers. According to <em>The Hill</em>, the senators, lead by Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) also want the EAC to detail cybersecurity challenges facing state and local officials as they look to safeguard future elections. Twenty-six senators, including Independents Angus King (Maine) and Bernie Sanders (Vt.), signed onto the letter.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>An investigation by the Ohio secretary of state’s office</strong> found that <a href="http://nbc4i.com/2017/02/27/ohio-secretary-of-state-investigation-found-non-citizens-registered-to-vote-cast-illegal-ballots/">385 non-U.S. citizens are registered to vote</a> in the Buckeye State and 82 of them have cast an illegal ballot in at least one election in 2016. Secretary of State Jon Husted said those 82 voters will be referred to law enforcement for further investigation and possible prosecution. “In light of the national discussion about illegal voting it is important to inform our discussions with facts. The fact is voter fraud happens, it is rare and when it happens, we hold people accountable,” Husted said. According to NBC4i, the 303 registered voters identified as non-citizens who have not cast a ballot will be sent letters both informing them that non-citizens are not eligible to vote and requesting that they cancel their registration. A follow-up letter will be sent to any individuals that still remain on the rolls after 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed language for the Humboldt County, California voter’s guide</strong> <a href="http://www.northcoastjournal.com/humboldt/county-seeks-to-quell-smell/Content?oid=4519751">doesn’t pass the smell test</a> according to Kelly Sanders, registrar of voters. A con-statement for a special election measure included a fart joke and Sanders objected to sending voters a packed with the joke. According to the <em>North Coast Journal</em>, because the writer of the con statement refuses to withdraw or amend his irreverent statement, and because state law doesn&#8217;t give elections officials discretion to censor ballot arguments, Sanders has decided to seek a court order to delete the offending words.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> The House has given initial approval to proposals that will ask voters to repeal or revise a 1998 law that keeps lawmakers from repealing or changing <a href="http://azdailysun.com/news/state-and-regional/house-to-debate-bills-targeting-voter-initiative-rules/article_1d988eb1-5f63-5829-bc1e-7570e591efbe.html">voter-approved laws</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> The Arkansas House has passed a resolution that, if approved by voters, would require residents to present <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/feb/23/arkansas-house-passes-voter-id-measure/">photo ID</a> in order to vote.</p>
<p>Also in Arkansas, under a bill approved by a Senate committee, the <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/mar/01/bill-assigns-election-board-to-secretar/?f=news-arkansas">state board of election commissioners</a> would be shifted to the secretary of state’s office. Under bill 368, the board would be under the direction of the secretary of state but would exercise its powers, duties and functions independently. With dozens of senators not voting, the bill <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/mar/02/senate-rejects-election-board-s-shift-t/?f=news-arkansas">failed</a> 7-15.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> A House committee has approved legislation that would require the phrase <a href="http://news.wabe.org/post/ga-license-bill-tweaked-noncitizen-becomes-ineligible-voter">“ineligible voter”</a> to be printed on driver’s licenses issued to people who are not U.S. citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho:</strong> The Senate is set to take up a House-approved bill that would put <a href="http://www.kivitv.com/news/bill-limiting-early-voting-headed-to-idaho-senate">limits on early voting</a>. If approved, the early voting window in Idaho could take place any time from three weeks prior to the election to one week before. Currently clerks have the choice to begin early voting on or before the third week from an election.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> House Bill 1472 would allow more counties to eliminate precinct polling places with <a href="http://www.tristatehomepage.com/news/local-news/in-lawmakers-advance-two-voting-bills/662075737">vote centers</a>. The measure would also eliminate an existing requirement that county election boards unanimously approve vote centers. The bill now moves to the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa: </strong> Plans to amend Secretary of State Paul Pate&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="http://siouxcityjournal.com/news/state-and-regional/iowa/republicans-reverse-course-on-reduced-early-voting/article_cbc6ffee-84dd-53af-957d-ee8f32894cec.html">election intergity bill</a> to limit early voting and alter polling place hours have been scrapped although an amendment to eliminate straight-ticket voting remains. The amendment means that two different versions of the bill are moving through the House and Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky:</strong> The House Election, Constitutional Amendments and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee has approved a bill that would <a href="http://weku.fm/post/house-committee-approves-special-election-rule-change">reduce the number of special elections</a>. The bill would move local referendums to primary or general election dates.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> A large crowd recently showed up before the Legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee to testify about a <a href="http://freepressonline.com/Content/Download-the-current-issue-as-a-pdf/Features/Article/Big-Turnout-in-Opposition-to-Voter-Photo-I-D-Bill/93/78/50647">proposed voter ID law</a>. While some were there in support of the bill, according to The Free Press, most of those in attendance were there to speak out in opposition to the bill.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> A bill that would require voters in the Old Line State to show a <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-oaks-voting-20170227-story.html">photo ID</a> in order to cast a ballot was incorrectly reported by the Department of Legislative Services and listed Baltimore Sen. Nathaniel Oaks (D) on the bill. The bill has been introduced in the House of Delegates by Del. Neil Parrott (R-Washington County).</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> Legislation that would allow <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/28/early-voting-dies/98522440/">early voting and create online voter registration</a> for Mississippi has died in the Senate without a vote. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t even take them up in committee,&#8221; Denny, R-Jackson, who also authored both bills told <em>The Clarion-Ledger.</em> &#8220;The Senate Elections chairwoman had said they were DOA. To me that&#8217;s almost insulting, to have our committee in the House pass these out two years in a row, then have them pass the full House with no more than two to four dissenting votes, and then the Senate committee not even discuss them, to announce that they are DOA before they even get them.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> The Government, Military and Veteran’s Affairs committee voted 5 to 1 to support legislation that would restore <a href="http://journalstar.com/legislature/committee-advances-bill-to-allow-immediate-voting-rights-to-felons/article_159a8184-e27b-506f-bd4e-344dd65cccc7.html">ex-felons’ voting rights</a> as soon as the complete the terms of service instead of waiting for two years after that as current law states.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> The Senate Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections is considering a bill that would leave it up to the state central committees to request that a <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/presidential-primaries-could-be-the-horizon-nevada">secret-ballot primary</a> be held in February in presidential election years.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Sen. Regina Birdsell (R-Hampstead) has introduced Senate Bill 3 that would require anyone who registers to vote within 30 days of an election, present definitive <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/new-state-senate-gop-voter-registration-plan-tightens-proof-of-residency-requirements/8973521">proof-of-residency</a> in the state.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: By a 5-2 vote, a bill that would have allowed voters to be <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/legislature/automatic-voter-registration-bill-dies-in-committee/article_47544e5c-51f4-52b9-a42d-8cf34540cc48.html">automatically registered to vote</a> when applying for a new or renewing their driver’s license, was killed in committee. Two Democrats joined with Republicans to vote against the bill.</p>
<p>In other legislative news, the full House has approved House Bill 174 by a 38-29 vote. The bill, if approved by the Senate would <a href="http://nmpolitics.net/index/2017/02/house-oks-legislation-to-consolidate-most-local-elections/">consolidate most local elections</a>, including those for cities and school districts.</p>
<p>The Senate Rules Committee has forward a bill — without recommendation — to the Judiciary Committee that, if approved, would <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/958664/open-primary-bill-moves-forward-in-senate.html">open New Mexico’s primaries</a>.</p>

<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Under Senate Bill 60, clerks of the court would be required to report to the state board of elections the reasons some people have been <a href="http://www.wral.com/bill-to-match-jury-excuses-with-voter-lists-raises-concerns/16556943/">excused from jury duty</a>. The Senate Judiciary Committee debated the bill but has yet to vote on it.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> Sen. Rod Monroe (D-Portland) plans to introduce legislation that would push Oregon’s <a href="http://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-last-minute-voter-registration/">voter registration deadline</a> to the day before an election.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> According to Sen. Lisa Boscola, Senate leaders are drafting a <a href="http://www.wfmz.com/news/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-senator-wants-independent-voters-in-state-primaries/368481358">voter’s bill of rights</a> that would include no-excuse absentee voting, same-day registration and pre-registration.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Rep. Micah Van Huss (R-Jonesborough) and Sen. Mae Beavers (R-Mt. Juliet) have introduced a bill that would impose an additional $5,000 fine on those convicted of voter fraud and offer a $5,000 <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/27/anti-voter-fraud-bill-offers-5000-reward-tips/98499170/">reward for reports leading to a voter fraud conviction</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> After being held back twice, a bill to provide <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/4996961-155/voter-registration-privacy-bill-goes-to">privacy protections to voter-registration records</a> cleared committee on a 7-2 vote and is headed to the House floor. Before committee approval, HB348 was changed to allow all who are part of the political process to have access to the records, including the voter&#8217;s date of birth. In addition to political parties, candidates and persons affiliated with political action committees or political issues, as well as some nonprofits will still be eligible to receive voter records. The news media also is allowed access to the records to verify the identity of an individual.</p>
<p>By a 67-0 vote, the House approved legislation that will require county clerks to come up with plans, to be reviewed by the lieutenant governor’s office, on how to <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/home/5001208-155/bill-goes-to-governor-seeking-to">keep election lines under 30 minutes long</a>. The bill was approved 27-0 by the Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) has vetoed a bill that he said would require local election officials to <a href="http://wric.com/2017/02/24/gov-mcauliffe-vetoes-bill-to-investigate-potential-voter-fraud/">investigate voters without a clear standard</a> for how and when such investigations should be undertaken. The bill would have required local electoral boards to investigate the list of registered voters when the number of registered voters in a county or city exceeds the population of those old enough to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> The Senate has approved legislation by 49-0 that would <a href="http://www.heraldnet.com/news/senate-oks-bill-to-add-hundreds-of-ballot-drop-boxes-in-state/">increase the number of ballot drop boxes</a> statewide by almost 400. The bill requires at least one ballot drop box for every 15,000 residents.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has approved the <a href="http://www.kentreporter.com/news/state-house-passes-bill-to-give-local-voters-stronger-voices/">Washington Voting Rights Act</a>. This if the fifth time the House has approved voting rights legislation. None of the earlier versions were approved by the Senate. The bill, HB 1800, initially modeled after the Federal Voting Rights Act, would allow communities who are systemically disenfranchised in local government elections to challenge the process in state court, after a six-month cooling off and negotiating period. Unlike the Federal Voting Rights Act, this new state process would be quicker and less costly.</p></p>

<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> A lawsuit challenging Massachusetts’ <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2017/02/27/suit-tests-20-day-voter-registration-cutoff-in-massachusetts">20-day voter registration cutoff deadline</a> is working its way through the courts with a goal of finding a final resolution ahead of next year’s elections.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island</strong>: The Cranston, Rhode Island police department is <a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20170228/cranston-police-probing-general-election-voting-irregularities">investigating eight voting irregularities</a> in the November 2016 general election. Mayor Allan W. Fung told <em>The Providence Journal</em> the irregularities cropped up during a customary audit of the election by the board of canvassers.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: According to <em>Newsday,</em> attorneys for the Nassau County board of elections must file briefs by the end of February for a <a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/suit-that-calls-for-freeport-voter-lists-to-be-purged-discussed-in-court-1.13166286">voter registration list lawsuit</a>. The plaintiffs, four candidates for the upcoming municipal elections on March 21, allege that the voter rolls are bloated with those who have died or moved.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina:</strong> Last week the governor and attorney general ask the U.S. Supreme Court to halt its review of North Carolina’s <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article135314754.html">voter ID</a> and now legislators angry over that decision have filed a court document seeking to be added to the ID case.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> Federal prosecutors in Tennessee have accused two residents of <a href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/breakingnews/story/2017/feb/28/feds-charge-two-tennessee-residents-buying-votes-us-senate-primary/415176/">buying votes</a> in the 2017 U.S. Senate primary election. The 14-count federal indictment alleges that 13 people were paid to vote in the 2014 Senate primary.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> On February 24 a federal judge denied a request from the U.S. Department of Justice and Texas AG Ken Paxton to delay a March hearing on the state’s <a href="http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2017/02/24/judge-denies-request-to-delay-texas-voter-id-lawsuit/">voter ID law</a>. Then on Monday February 27 the DOJ <a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/politics/tns-doj-texas-voter-lawsuit.html">withdrew its appeal</a>.</p>
<p>Also in Texas, Crystal Mason, 41, has been indicted on a charge of <a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/election/article135748503.html">illegally voting</a> in the 2016 election. Mason cast a ballot even though she was still on supervised release for a conviction. Mason claims she did not know she could not vote.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> The state’s Republican Party has had a change of heart and is reversing its decision to drop a legal challenge to the <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865674343/Utah-GOP-reverses-decision-to-drop-Count-My-Vote-lawsuit.html">Count My Vote</a> law that allows candidates a pathway to a primary ballot by gathering signatures. The party voted to see through its appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> A three-judge panel of the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals recently heard arguments over claims that Republicans in Wisconsin had deliberately made it harder for minorities to vote by limiting <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/24/federal-appeals-court-hear-wisconsins-voter-id-early-voting-cases-friday/98308938/">early voting</a>. According to the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em>, the judges seemed skeptical.</p>
<p>Also in Wisconsin, a <a href="http://wbay.com/2017/02/28/ex-con-charged-after-illegally-voting-for-trump/">recently released felon</a> on parole cast a ballot for Donald Trump in the November 2016 election and now he’s facing additional charges because he had not yet regained his voting rights because he was still on parole.</p></p>

							<h2>Tech Thursday</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;V. Tech Thursday</strong></p>
<p><strong>National Tech:</strong> The U.S. Election Assistance Commission has certified ES&amp;S’ most recent voting suite EVS 5400, which <a href="http://www.essvote.com/blog/95/">certifies the ExpressVote as a tabulator</a>. The new tabulator mode allows voters to make all of their selections using the ExpressVote’s easy to read touchscreen. It can be configured to either return marked vote summary cards to the voter for manual review before re-inserting into the unit for tabulation or allow the voter to automatically cast their vote hands-free, after on-screen review with AutoCast®. Fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the ExpressVote can be used by every voter, regardless of abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> The secretary of state’s office has finalized <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/28/state-finalizes-contract-new-voting-machines/98551660/">$82 million in contracts</a> with Dominion Voting Systems, ES&amp;S and Hart InterCivic to bring new voting equipment to the state by the 2018 election cycle.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Selectmen in the town of Exeter have agreed to purchase <a href="http://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20170223/exeter-to-fund-technology-for-blind-voters">accessible election equipment</a> although it may not be in place for the upcoming town election.
