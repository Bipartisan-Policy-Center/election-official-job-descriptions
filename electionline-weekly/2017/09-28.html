							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Helping to build a voting time estimator</strong><br /><em>New tool will estimate how long it will take to vote a ballot</em></p>
<p>By Kurt Sampsel<a href="mailto:kurt@techandciviclife.org"><br /></a>Center for Technology and Civic Life</p>
<p>Everyone in the election field knows how important it is to minimize waits at the polls, and in recent years, we’ve seen big advances in using data to help predict and avoid polling place stress.</p>
<p>But while there’s a lot of research on overall wait times, there’s little data out there that addresses one critical piece of the puzzle: the amount of time it takes to vote a ballot.</p>
<p>For that reason, the <a href="https://www.techandciviclife.org/">Center for Technology and Civic Life</a> is working with software developer Mark Pelczarski to build a tool that will estimate how long it will take voters to mark a ballot based on its contents. Once it’s ready, the tool will be available for free in the <a href="http://electiontools.org/">Election Toolkit</a>.</p>
<p>As we move forward with the project, election officials have an important role to play in helping it come together.</p>
<p><strong>Working toward a goal</strong><br />“We know that when voters experience long wait times at the polling place, it can discourage participation,” says Whitney May, Director of Government Services at the Center. “This project is about collecting data to discover a clearer connection between ballots and voting times. Ultimately, we want to give election officials a free tool they can use to make resource allocation decisions that minimize wait times for voters.”</p>
<p>These are issues that have been on Mark’s mind for a long time.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Mark wrote and refined a software program (often called the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/vtp/calc3.htm">Line Optimization Tool</a>) that uses data inputs to predict polling place capacity. It’s a highly useful program, but it’s dependent on a few key pieces of data &#8212; in particular, the predicted average minutes to vote.</p>
<p>“Those who have used the tool can readily see how critical a difference a minute or so in that average time can be; it can easily change a smoothly-functioning polling place into one with long lines and hours-long waits,” explains Mark. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he says, this highly sensitive “minutes to vote” has often been the product of guesswork instead of real data, meaning that officials end up making important decisions based on unreliable information.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that determining voting times has been such a stubborn challenge is needing to account for all of the possible variations in ballots. But Mark has a plan for tackling this challenge, and his work will yield incredibly valuable information for election administrators.</p>
<p>“We’re using computational and mathematical analysis,” Mark explains, “to correlate differences in ballots with differences in completion times. For example, how much time does each additional contested race add to the time needed to vote? How much for each referendum? Is there a measurable time difference between electronic and paper voting? These are among over a dozen variables we&#8217;re analyzing.”</p>
<p>Mark is refining the math and programming stages of the project, but the most important step is collecting data &#8212; lots of it. This is where we need the help of election officials who care about these questions.</p>
<p><strong>Collecting ballot time data</strong><br />Although we have a good start with data contributed by Charles Stewart III of MIT, we need more to be able to create a reliable estimator.</p>
<p>“We’d like to collect as much actual timing data as possible with a wide variety of different ballots,” Mark describes. “Ideally, we’d like 50 or more voters timed with each ballot and minimally at least 30, so that we have reliable averages and ranges for the mathematical portion of our work.”</p>
<p>This may sound like a lot, but data collection doesn’t need to be a major undertaking. Although we’d like to have election officials oversee several timers working at several polling places, a single timer working at just 1 polling place could collect voting times for over 50 voters in an hour or two.</p>
<p>If you’re an election official who already has data on voting times, we hope you’ll volunteer to contribute to this project by sharing your data.</p>
<p>If you don’t have data, we’d love to have you collect some during an upcoming election, and we’re ready with technology and support to help you.</p>
<p>On the technology front, Mark has developed a simple tool to streamline the data collection process.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="http://electiontools.org/tool/voting-timer-app/">Voting Timer App</a> he created, you can time 4 booths simultaneously, and it automatically uploads your results, so you don’t need to do any data entry. It’s a lot easier than using a stopwatch and a pencil.</p>
<p>In terms of support, CTCL is offering training and assistance at no cost.</p>
<p>“If you’re interested in collecting ballot time data,” Whitney explains, “CTCL can train you and your team to use the Voting Timer App to collect voting times at your polling places. We want to make it as easy as possible for election officials to contribute data, so all that’ll be required from your office is a few staff members and their time.”</p>
<p>We hope you’ll consider contributing to this project. By helping us build this tool, you’ll also be helping the countless election officials around the country who will benefit from it.</p>
<p>If you have voting time data that you can share, or if you’d like to talk with us about collecting data in your area, please get in touch by emailing <a href="mailto:hello@techandciviclife.org">hello@techandciviclife.org</a>.</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Update</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>Late last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security contacted the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/dhs-tells-states-about-russian-hacking-during-2016-election/2017/09/22/fd263a2c-9fe2-11e7-8ea1-ed975285475e_story.html?utm_term=.4c5366fdf4f2">21 states it said the Russians had tempted to infiltrate</a> during the 2016 election cycle. The contact comes three months after DHS had originally announced the attempted hacks but did not release the list of states.</p>
<p>“We heard feedback from the secretaries of state that this was an important piece of information,” Bob Kolasky, acting deputy undersecretary for DHS’s National Protection and Programs Directorate told <em>The Washington Post</em>. “We agreed that this information would help election officials make security decisions.”</p>
<p>However, by Wednesday, DHS was <a href="http://www.necn.com/news/politics/Homeland-Security-Clarifying-State-Election-Hacking-Attempts-448333313-448333663.html">backtracking</a> a bit. While Russians had attempted to breach statewide systems in California and Wisconsin in the run-up to the election, the systems that they attempted to breach were not elections-related.</p>
<p>In Presidential Election Commission news, The Hill reports that the Lawyers’ Committee For Civil Rights Under the Law is calling on members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to question Attorney General Jeff Sessions about the <a href="http://thehill.com/regulation/administration/351733-group-urges-senate-to-probe-doj-link-to-trump-voter-fraud">Department of Justice’s connection to the president’s election commission</a>.</p>
<p>“With significant evidence of politicization at the Department and within the Civil Rights Division in particular, it is critical the Senate Judiciary Committee fulfills its oversight role,” Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee said.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Georgia has become the most recent state to <a href="http://www.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/trump-fraud-panel-agrees-pay-250-for-georgia-voter-data/iuLwxczYAZJebO8TMb4qSL/">provide limited voter data</a> to the election commission after the commission agreed to pay the state $250.</p></p>

<p><strong>A study by University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist</strong> Ken Mayer and funded by Dane County Clerk Scott McDonnell found that 16,800 to 23,250 voters in two counties <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/09/26/wisconsin-voter-id-law-deterred-nearly-17-000-voting-uw-study-says/702026001/">did not vote because of the state’s voter ID law</a>. According to the <em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em>, key portions of those surveyed said they did not vote because they did not have ID that would allow them to or did not believe the IDs they had could be used under the voting law. The study found the ID law&nbsp;disproportionately affected African-Americans and low-income people.</p>
<p><strong>An <a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865689700/Audit-of-3rd-District-primary-shows-weaknesses-in-election-process.html">audit of Utah’s 3rd Congressional District special election</a></strong> has pointed out some mistakes in the process and offered recommendations for avoiding similar mistakes. Auditor John Dougall recommended that poll workers strengthen protections to ballot secrecy and that elections officials send out correct ballots in a timely manner to prevent initial ballot errors.</p>

The organizations said it is concentrating first on NFL and NBA teams, but has plans to eventually hold events for MLB, NHL, WNBA and other professional sports teams. “We’re about amplifying athletes’ voices,” RISE CEO Jocelyn Benson told <em>The Washington Post</em>. “We’re not about telling an athlete how to do that or what to say.”</p>
<p><strong>Cuyahoga County, Ohio Executive Armond Budish announced this week</strong> that the county will be <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/cuyahoga-county/index.ssf/2017/09/new_cuyahoga_county_initiative_will_encourage_voting.html">hiring a voting rights coordinator</a>. &#8220;The right to vote is critical to our democracy,&#8221; County Executive Armond Budish said in a statement. &#8220;At a time when some are trying to make it harder to vote, we need to do more to help people get registered. Cuyahoga County is dedicated to making voting as accessible as possible for all of our residents.&#8221; The county will hire a voting-rights coordinator, who will work with other county agencies to improve civic engagement opportunities. The coordinator will also promote voter registration efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Seriously, we could have told you this would not end well.</strong> This week Boston council candidate Pat Payaso — which is Spanish for clown — thought it would be a good idea to <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_politics/2017/09/creepy_clown_candidate_brings_police_to_college_polling_place">dress up as a clown</a> and visit a few polling locations. Needless to say that didn’t float with voters who called the police and notified them that there was a “creepy clown” hanging around.</p>
