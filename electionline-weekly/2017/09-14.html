							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pasco County registration program makes lemonade from lemons</strong><br /><em>Program has reached nearly half a million residents</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>electionline</p>
<p>Jury duty… two words that are probably rivaled only by Tax Day in their ability strike fear and loathing into the heart of most Americans.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://www.pascovotes.com/">Pasco County, Florida Supervisor of Elections</a> Brian Corely sees those two words as an opportunity. The opportunity to engage a captive audience and extoll the virtues of becoming a registered voter.</p>
<p>In 2010, the county began a partnership with the county clerk and comptroller to do voter outreach to the pool of potential jurors called for duty on Monday mornings.</p>
<p>While prospective jurors wait through the jury selection process, Corley does a brief presentation on the importance of voting and keeping your voter registration current, and explains the different voting options.</p>
<p>Voter registration forms are available to interested persons as well as vote-by-mail ballot request forms, Voter’s Guides, and postcards with the Elections’ Office contact information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Although the goal of this outreach was to make registering to vote readily available and convenient, it was launched during a period of strict budget cuts in which we sought innovative, cost effective methods of reaching large segments of the population,” Corley said.</p>
<p>Since the start of the program Corley estimates he’s reached almost half a million Pasco County residents.</p>
<p>“Through the jury pool program, we reach over 40,000 citizens of our county yearly with little to no impact on our yearly budget,” Corley said. “The program remains a mainstay of our voter outreach due the success of cost effectively reaching the over 450,000 citizens of Pasco County one captive audience at a time!”</p>
<p>Corley makes the trip to Circuit Court himself each Monday morning, although he does now have staff come with him to assist with registration, registration confirmation and signing up for vote-by-mail.</p>
<p>“Not many people actually get super excited about jury duty but they get it-the awesome responsibility and role they play in our criminal justice system and the 7th amendment,” Corley said. “I sense an occasional vibe of ‘annoyed to be there’ but most are good natured about the experience.”</p>
<p>Another change to the program since it began seven years ago is the addition of an e-poll book that Corley brings with him.</p>
<p>“Now, when voters are unsure of their voter registration, we can look in the database, and advise them of their status and if an update is needed,” Corley said. “This immediate feedback in combination with the convenience of required paperwork and the availability of time offers immediate list maintenance that isn’t dependent on the voter following through at some future date.”</p>
<p>Corley also gets an opportunity to talk to voters about a variety of issues and dispel some rumors about the elections process.</p>
<p>“You name it- I&#8217;ve heard it!” he said.</p>
<p>The inquiries range from vote-by-mail — and the myth that vote-by-mail ballots only count in a recount to early voting. Corley also loves being able to dispel the biggest myth of all about voter registration.</p>
<p>“What better way to dispel the myth that names for jury duty are selected from the voter registration rolls, and to reach those potential voters who didn’t register because of it.”</p>
<p>And for those wondering, interestingly enough Corley has not been called for jury duty himself in the entire time he’s been running this program.</p>
<p><em>(<strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> Do you have a unique voter registration program? Let us know, we&#8217;d love to share it with our readers.)</em></p>

							<h2>Follow Up on the News</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Follow Up on the News</strong></p>
<p>Last week we took a look at how Hurricanes Harvey and Irma were impacting elections officials in Texas and in Florida and other East Coast states.</p>
<p>We’ll give our friends on the East Coast a bit more time to assess the damage and the lights turned back on before we follow-up with them, but we did hear from <a href="http://www.harrisvotes.com/">Harris County, Texas</a> and how they weathered Hurricane Harvey.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the county experienced no flooding at its elections warehouse or the county clerk’s office itself, but two branch offices are closed indefinitely.</p>
<p>“Overall, the County Clerk Office capacity to serve the public remains strong,” said Hector DeLeon, spokesman for the clerk’s office.</p>
<p>While the county clerk’s office and elections warehouse were spared, the same cannot be said for the county’s voting sites.</p>
<p>“The availability of six of forty-six early voting locations is undetermined,” DeLeon said. “An assessment of the availability of Election Day polling locations is ongoing.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sos.state.tx.us/">secretary of state’s office</a> provided guidance for assisting displaced voters:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a voter is able to return to their home, they may vote as usual in their county polling place.&nbsp; We realize that this is not possible for everyone affected by the storm, but suggest that voters check with their county, via phone or online, for the latest local information regarding polling places and early voting.
</li>
<li>A voter may apply for a ballot by mail from their home county.&nbsp; Voters wishing to vote by mail must submit an application for ballot by mail to their county election office; the application must be received no later than Friday, October 27, 2017.&nbsp; On the application, the voter must indicate that they will be out of their home county during early voting and on election day.&nbsp; Voters need to provide a mailing address for the ballot which is outside of their home Texas county.
</li>
<li>A voter may register to vote in their new county of residence.&nbsp; Voters in Texas must be registered to vote in the county that they consider their permanent residence or home.&nbsp; If a voter relocated to another county before or after the storm and has decided to stay in their new county, they may register to vote in their new county.&nbsp; Voters in this situation must submit a new voter registration application in their new county of residence no later than October 10, 2017 in order to vote in the November election.&nbsp; If a voter is not sure when they will return to their home county, but does intend to return, they must vote in their home county, either in person or by mail, and should not register to vote in the county where they are temporarily residing while evacuated.
</li>
<li>A voter may vote a limited ballot.&nbsp; Voters may also wish to vote a “limited ballot.”&nbsp; During the early voting period, October 23 – November 3, a voter can vote a limited ballot at the main early voting polling place in their new county.&nbsp; The ballot will feature all races or propositions which the new county and home county ballots have in common.&nbsp; For instance, a limited ballot anywhere in Texas will include the constitutional amendment election.&nbsp; Voting a limited ballot in the new county has the effect of registering the voter in the new county.&nbsp; A limited ballot is a good option for anyone who missed the registration deadline for a new county.&nbsp;&nbsp; provide displaced voters &nbsp;In Harris County, the vast majority of voters cast ballots during the twelve day Early Voting Period because all voters may vote at any one of the early voting locations.&nbsp;</li>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>The Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/09/12/550518986/tension-and-protests-mark-trump-voting-commission-meeting">met for the second time</a> this week and heard from a wide range of panelists throughout the daylong meeting.</p>
<p>There were some tense moments in the meeting between Vice Chair Kris Kobach (R-Kansas) and New Hampshire Secretary of State William Gardner (D). In advance of the meeting Kobach <a href="“All%20the%20commission%20is%20doing%20is%20collecting%20data,”%20he%20added.%20“It%20may%20make%20recommendations,%20or%20I%20think%20at%20this%20point%20there’s%20a%20high%20possibility%20the%20commission%20makes%20no%20recommendations%20and%20they%20just%20say,%20‘Here’s%20the%20data.%20States,%20do%20with%20it%20what%20you">alleged</a> that there may have been enough voter fraud in the 2016 election in New Hampshire to sway the outcome.</p>
<p>According to NPR, Gardner said Kobach&#8217;s column caused a &#8220;problem&#8221; by questioning whether last year&#8217;s election was &#8220;real and valid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is real and valid,&#8221; he said, to the applause of some in the audience.</p>
<p>The commission heard one proposal that all voters should go through the same federal background checks that gun owners are subject too.</p>
<p>The commission also heard from University of New Hampshire political scientist Andrew Smith about voter turnout data from the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>&#8220;The major reason that they see that people don&#8217;t vote &#8230; is that they just didn&#8217;t bother, they weren&#8217;t interested, they forgot,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;Basically, issues of convenience and noninterest were the major reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several dozen protestors, led by former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander (D) protested outside of the meeting.</p>
<p>Kobach spoke to reporters after the meeting and said that claims of voter suppression by the commission were “bizarre.”</p>
<p>“All the commission is doing is collecting data,” he said according to The Associated Press. “It may make recommendations, or I think at this point there’s a high possibility the commission makes no recommendations and they just say, ‘Here’s the data. States, do with it what you want.&#8217;”</p>
<p>Speaking of the data, the Associated Press has an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/how-states-are-handling-trumps-voter-information-request/2017/09/12/a90dc746-97f6-11e7-af6a-6555caaeb8dc_story.html?utm_term=.fbe4f26eaf72">up-to-date, state-by-state</a> (and the District too!) round up of how each jurisdiction has responded to the request for data.</p>
<p>Alabama: Probate Judge Alan King (D), a member of the presidential election commission who was not able to attend the meeting in New Hampshire submitted a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-advisory-commission-election-integrity-resources">5-page report</a> to the commission in which he <a href="http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2017/09/alabama_probate_judge_election.html">stressed the importance of expanding the right to vote</a> instead of hampering it. &#8220;It is my sincere hope and prayer that this Commission will focus on the real election issues facing the United States of America, including alleged &#8216;hacking&#8217; by the Russians, instead of spending precious time focusing on non-issues to deprive American citizens from voting,&#8221; King wrote.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The four Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation urged Secretary of State William Gardner (D) to <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/gardner-refuses-call-by-congressional-delegation-to-step-down-from-trump-election-commission/12199895">step down from his role on presidential election commission</a>. Gardner said he will not be stepping down. “No, I’m not going to step down, and it’s hypocritical to ask me to step down as a member of a federal commission,” Gardner said. “Have they ever stepped down from a Senate committee or a committee that they serve on because they disagreed with someone on the committee?”</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: Secretary of State Al Jaeger has told the White House election commission that the state is <a href="http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/north-dakota-unable-to-provide-voter-info-to-election-commission/article_f43ebb58-32da-5b6a-8431-7b43d592438c.html">unable to provide the requested voter data</a> because the state does not register voters and state law does not allow information maintained in the Central Voter File to be shared “except with certain individuals and groups for a specific limited purpose.”</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> The election commission has paid the $500 necessary to purchase Oregon’s statewide voter list. Under <a href="http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/371678-255513-feds-come-up-with-500-for-statewide-voter-info-list">a new policy</a> developed by Secretary of State Dennis Richardson the statewide voter list purchased by the commission did not include voters’ Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, signatures, disability information, phone numbers, birthdays, how a person voted in any election, certain information about public safety officers, participants in the address confidentiality program, persons who demonstrated that their personal safety is in danger and receive and exemption from their county clerk, and 16- or 17- year-olds who preregister to vote.</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>A new report from the Texas Civil Rights Project finds</strong> that no private high schools and just 14 percent of the state’s public high schools are complying with a <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/local/report-few-high-schools-texas-comply-with-voter-registration-law/VDe3oja05nIVFBcqX6sCvM/">state law that requires high schools to distribute voter registration forms</a> to students twice per year. The organization as well as the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law found that 198 out of 1,428 public high schools requested the forms. In total, the organizations said, six percent of high schools in Texas requested forms. According to the <em>Austin American-Statesman</em>, while the schools can get the voter registration forms from sources other than the secretary of state’s office, they argued that based on the state’s low youth voter registration and turnout rates, it’s clear the schools are not doing so. “This unique law should make Texas a leader in youth voter registration and turnout,”&nbsp; Beth Stevens, voting rights director for the TCRP said at a press conference. “But that’s not the reality.” Secretary of State Rolando Pablos wrote in an op-ed this summer that student voter registration is one of his top priorities.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile in California, the secretary of state’s office has launched</strong> an online <a href="http://highschool.latimes.com/riverside-community-college/secretary-of-state-alex-padilla-involves-school-districts-in-pre-registration-initiative-with-online-toolkit/">Back-to-School Pre-Registration Toolkit</a>. “Along with backpacks, new clothes, and school supplies, 16 and 17-year-olds should add pre-registration to their back to school checklists,” Secretary of State Alex Padilla said. The idea is that these toolkits (which include downloadable posters and brochures, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVkNVyJw5a4">PSA video</a>, sample social media posts and informational links) will help school’s better engage with their students on issues of voter registration and being active in their community.</p>
<p><strong>Break out those colored pencils Cape Girardeau, Missouri students!</strong> The county clerk’s office is sponsoring a contest, open to all 9th through 12th grade students in the county, to <a href="http://krcu.org/post/cape-girardeau-county-clerks-office-hosting-i-voted-sticker-design-contest-high-schoolers#stream/0">come up with a new “I Voted” sticker for the county</a>. County Supervisor of Elections Allen Seabaugh told KRCU that the idea actually came from a teacher who in 2016 got her students excited about the election by collecting “I Voted” stickers from across the country. The student who wins will have their design used on stickers given to voters who cast ballots during the 2018 and 2019 elections. “It will allow them to be involved in the election process, even for some of those students who aren’t quite 18 years of age and unable to register to vote, if they can be involved in creating the stickers we’re going to use to give voters at the polls.” Seabaugh told the station. We hear at electionline.org cannot wait to see the winning sticker and add it to our own collection of “I Voted” stickers.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>V. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Lawmakers have approved Assembly Bill 606 which would allow election officials to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-lawmakers-vote-to-slim-down-1504808420-htmlstory.html">print only summaries of ballot measures in statewide voter guides</a>. The bill requires the secretary of state to make clear in future voter guides the Internet address where voters can find the full text of ballot measures. Voters would also be given the option of calling a toll-free number to request a full guide of the legal language.</p>
<p>Also in California, a group of youth commissioners from several cities in the Bay Area traveled to Sacramento to lobby on behalf of ACA 10 which would <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/09/08/west-valley-teens-travel-to-sacramento-to-advocate-for-lowering-voting-age/">lower the state’s voting age</a> to 17. According to Assemblyman Evan Low (D-28th District) the legislation he introduced has bipartisan support.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> Voters in Greenbelt will decide whether or not to <a href="http://www.dbknews.com/2017/09/10/greenbelt-voting-age-referendum-city-council/">allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections</a>. The city’s Youth Advisory Committee put the proposal forward in 2015 and after two years of work, it was struck down by a 4-3 vote of the city council. Instead the proposal will appear on the November 7 ballot.</p>
<p>Also in Maryland, the College Park City council voted 4-3 to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/college-park-decides-to-allow-noncitizens-to-vote-in-local-elections/2017/09/13/2b7adb4a-987b-11e7-87fc-c3f7ee4035c9_story.html?utm_term=.a68fc1ecf529">allow noncitizens to vote</a> in local elections. The new ordinance will allow all undocumented immigrants, student-visa holders and residents with green cards to vote in city elections. About 20 percent of College Park’s 32,275 residents are &shy;foreign-born, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The University of Maryland campus, with more than 27,000 undergraduates, has about 3,600 international students.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has signed a bill into law that will allow election inspectors to <a href="http://www.post-journal.com/news/local-news/2017/09/cuomo-signs-youngs-election-inspector-bill/">work a split shift</a>. The new law permits Boards of Election to divide the shift, thereby eliminating a major obstacle to election inspector recruitment and retention. The payment for each worker would be adjusted accordingly.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VI. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Judge John Menedez has dismissed a suit against Siskiyou County Registrar of Voters Colleen Setzer, the county’s sheriff and several state employees and agencies brought by Hmong residents of the county who alleged in they were <a href="http://www.redding.com/story/news/local/2017/09/12/judge-tosses-hmong-voters-suit-against-siskiyou-county-state/658120001/">discriminated against during a voter fraud investigation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: A state Supreme Court ruling has made it possible for two-member county boards of elections to <a href="http://www.fayobserver.com/news/20170908/inside-politics-court-order-lets-cumberland-board-of-elections-do-its-job">continue to do their work</a> while the larger lawsuit about the state’s electoral process proceeds. Associate Justice Mike Morgan issued an order on Sept. 1 that says local election boards with just two members can conduct business. Their votes have to be unanimous to take effect, he said.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Late last week, plaintiffs in the ongoing suit against the state’s <a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/news/appeals-court-asked-block-texas-voter-law/wzgzNRSmHbR56JfNmQNXsN/">new voter ID law</a> asked all 14 judges of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to void a prior ruling by a three-judge panel of the court that would allow the state to use the ID law for this year’s elections.</p>
<p>Also in Texas, in a 5-4 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked two lower court rulings that had required Texas to <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Court-blocks-redrawing-Texas-maps-12193259.php">redraw certain congressional and state House districts</a> after the lower courts ruled the district lines discriminate against minorities. According to the Houston Chronicle, the justices gave no reasons in their one-paragraph statement granting a request from Texas that it not be forced to draw new districts until the Supreme Court reviewed the lower court&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge Jill Parrish has rejected a request by the Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission to rule in their favor in their suit against San Juan County and its <a href="http://fox13now.com/2017/09/07/judge-wont-toss-lawsuit-over-vote-by-mail-in-san-juan-county/">decision to move to vote-by-mail</a>. The suit alleges that the reduced number of polling places burdens Navajo voters who must sometimes drive hours to vote. Judge Parrish also rejected a request by the county to dismiss the lawsuit outright.</p></p>

The <a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/VVSG-2.0-draft-principles-and-guidelines_8.18.17.pdf">draft calls for</a> an audit trail for electronic votes, data interoperability among voting systems, logging of user access for election tools and limits on who gets access and under what circumstances. On the hardware side, the guidelines look to tighten up physical security by making sure any attempt to tamper with voting gear leaves physical evidence. The guidelines also call for data protection. While it doesn&#8217;t require encryption per se, the guidelines call for all cryptographic algorithms to be, &#8220;public, well-vetted, and standardized.&#8221;</p>
