							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Project Vote to close its doors on May 31</strong><br /><em>At critical time for voting rights, lack of funding leads to closure</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p><a href="http://www.projectvote.org/">Project Vote</a>, a national, nonpartisan, nonprofit that has spent recent years focusing its attention on improving voter registration, especially the enforcement of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) will officially close its doors on May 31.</p>
<p>Michael Slater, president since 2003, cited the lack of funding as the reason for the closure.</p>
<p>“[F]unding for voter registration programs declined precipitously after 2008, and the number of funders supporting voting rights advocacy and litigation slowly decreased as well,” Slater said. “At the same time, more organizations created voting rights programs, which resulted in more competition.”</p>
<p>Slater also pointed to the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision to strike down the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act which resulted in the donor community focusing available voting rights resources on VRA enforcement, which had the effect of reducing funds for other work, such as Project Vote’s work enforcing the NVRA.</p>
<p>“Despite that changing environment, we were able for many years to continue to deliver on our mission to make sure the American electorate better reflected the needs and diversity of the American people,” Slater said.</p>
<p>For a single-issue nonprofit like Project Vote — without a diverse portfolio of work to fundraise on — the situation gradually become untenable.</p>
<p>“A reorganization of the civic engagement infrastructure, and donor uncertainty over how best to respond to the 2016 election, finally proved to be too much for us, and we were forced to conclude that our current model was unsustainable in this environment,” Slater said.</p>
<p>Project Vote’s shuttering comes at a time when voting rights are making headlines daily and Slater is concerned about what impact the closure may have.</p>
<p>“From our perspective, voting rights work has never been more important. We hae been warning for months that [President Donald J.] Trump’s absurd rhetoric about ‘voter fraud’ signaled a top-down assault on the right to vote in America,” Slater said. “The concern, of course, is that the remaining voting rights organizations, already spread thing, will be unable to keep up with this assault.</p>
<p>The news of Project Vote’s closure is slowly starting to spread throughout the elections community and it is being met with sadness.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re terribly saddened by the closing of Project Vote. It has been a great organization that has contributed significantly to the protection of the fundamental right to vote,” said Ezra Rosenberg, co-director of the Voting Rights Project at the <a href="https://lawyerscommittee.org/">Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law</a>. “Its role in ensuring the registration of all eligible voters was and remains of utmost importance. &nbsp;It is particularly unfortunate for this to happen at a time when voting rights are under tremendous attack.”</p>
<p>Project Vote was involved in many legal cases nationwide with some recent cases including reaching a settlement agreement with <a href="http://www.projectvote.org/wp-content/uploads/Amended-Signed-Maricopa-transparency-settlement-agreement-2017-01-30.pdf">Maricopa County, Arizona</a>, settling a suit with Georgia on access to public records Maricopa County, Arizona aas wellas an onling list maintenance case with a summary judgment deadline tomorrow in, <em><a href="https://publicinterestlegal.org/files/Doc-1-Complaint.pdf">ACRU v Snipes</a></em>, in Florida.</p>
<p>“This is very sad news for voters,” said <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/">Rick Hasen</a>, chancellor’s professor of law and political science at UC Irvine and author of the ElectionLaw Blog. “Project Vote has been a leader in making sure that states comply with the provisions of the motor-voter law making it easier for people to register and vote when they come into contact with government agencies. I hope that others can step in and help with this very important work.”</p>
<p>Thomas Hicks, commissioner on the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> pointed to the groups’ work in Nevada in 2016 that resulted in a <a href="http://www.projectvote.org/wp-content/uploads/MOU-NV-DMV-3.13.17.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a> to bring the state into compliance with NVRA.</p>
<p>“I am sad they are going away,” Hicks said. “They do a great deal in terms of voter registration and I don’t know if there are folks out there to fill that void. In my own opinion, it’s horrible that an organization that does as much as they do will no longer exist.”</p>
<p>John Lindback, who is currently executive director of <a href="http://www.ericstates.org/">ERIC</a>, but used to serve an elections official in Oregon and Alaska said that as an elections official, Project Vote was never far from his mind.</p>
<p>“When I served as an elections official I was keenly aware that Project Vote was watching and monitoring any actions by states that might adversely affect voting rights,” Lindback said. “Project Vote served as a constant reminder to elections officials that it was important, for example, to comply with the NVRA. Such groups are vitally important to any Democracy, including the U.S.A.”</p>
<p>Project vote has helped millions of Americans get registered to vote through their direct engagement project and they’ve trained countless organizations to run efficient, effective voter drives.</p>
<p>“My thought is, online voter registration is great, but it’s just one additional tool to get people registered to vote and you need groups like Project Vote out there actually doing the footwork,” Hicks said.</p>
<p>With its extensive library of advocacy materials, the Project Vote website will remain live for at least the next three years.</p>
<p>Moving forward, staff will be taking some time off to spend with family and reflect, but most will be looking for employment. According to Slater, there is a good possibility that many staff and a large portion of Project Vote’s program portfolio will move to peer organizations.</p>
<p>As for the future of Project Vote, while Slater isn’t optimistic, all hope is not necessarily lost.</p>
<p>“It is hard to un-ring that bell. The board, however, will be meeting to discuss whether there is a role for a reconfigured Project Vote in the future,” Slater said. “After all, the Project Vote of today is version 3.0 of something that started in 1984. Who’s to say that a Project Vote 4.0 won’t make sense in one or two years?”</p>

							<h2>Our Say</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;II. Our Say</strong></p>
<p>The impact of Project Vote<br /><a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/users/hessdoug">Douglas R. Hess</a>, assistant professor of Political Science<br />Grinnell College</p>
<p>The impact of Project Vote’s work can be found in three areas, in each of which Project Vote’s staff, which at one time included a young Barack Obama, played highly influential roles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, Project Vote directly and indirectly registered to vote millions of citizens. These were mostly low-income, women, minority, and new citizens. Indeed, the only direct voter registration efforts that came close to Project Vote’s record achievement in this area, were those of the Obama campaign. As voter registration drives grew, they came under increasing attack. Ironically, many election officials who were doing little to conduct or enforce mandated voter registration outreach&nbsp;under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), engaged in some of these attacks.</p>
<p>Second, it generated and advocated for research and technical assistance on policy and procedural matters that would close the voter registration and participation gaps in American elections. Finally, Project Vote played a role in numerous influential lawsuits related to voter registration rights, registration drives, access to voter registration records, and the purging of lists.</p>
<p>Of course, policy advocacy and litigation is an activity that a great many civil rights organizations engage in. However, not having grown out of the “LDEFs” (legal defense and education funds) movement, I think Project Vote often had a different take on policy and litigation.</p>
<p>Unlike its peer organizations, Project Vote had direct experience in the physical process of voter registration—as one past executive director said, it had the bruises to prove this. Also unlike its peers, Project Vote put a significant amount of time and expertise into analytic studies.</p>
<p>To provide one example, the one I am most personally familiar with, Project Vote’s experience beyond the courtroom and lobbies, influenced how it designed remedies for violations of the NVRA. When some groups stressed remedies such as 800 numbers and radio broadcasts, Project Vote insisted on very detailed monitoring data. As a direct result of this administrative detail, some states have maintained significant NVRA-related registration efforts for years. In other states, the data allows advocates (and officials if they were so interested) to identify non-compliance with the NVRA.</p>
<p>A related example was the promotion of voter registration technology in public offices that were poorly thought through but which allowed advocates, officials, and funders to claim success. The lack of attention to the mundane technical details, however, meant that some of these reforms fell apart shortly after they were implemented. A lack of analytic approach to how complex government organizations evolve and how policy is administered guaranteed that these some of these victories were short lived. Sadly, Project Vote, and occasionally a few allies who also had an analytic bent, often seemed to be playing the role of Cassandra in some of these battles, condemned to know what would (or wouldn&#8217;t) happen while lacking an audience that would listen.</p>
<p>Thus, I fear the disappearance, even if temporary, of Project Vote from the scene means that too much of the voting rights work will include courtroom battles and flashy policy changes that do not keep the eye on the prize: the registration gap and its connection to policy detail.<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beginning in 2018, Putnam County, Indiana</strong> hopes to <a href="http://www.bannergraphic.com/story/2414627.html">join a growing list of counties in the Hoosier State that uses vote centers</a> to conduct elections. According to the <em>Banner Graphic</em>, Clerk Heather Gilbert presented a proposal to the county commission to make the switch. “We’re asking to do this because we’re falling behind,” Gilbert said, pointing out that a number of surrounding counties have gone to the vote center model. According to the paper, Gilbert noted that the move going from 29 polling locations down to eight will cause a big change in the election day staff she needs, down to 56 workers from the 145 previously required. The county would also provide 267 fewer meals to workers on election day and save on rental costs of several of the locations.</p>
<p><strong>This makes us so happy!</strong> After an almost 20-year absence, Northampton County, Pennsylvania will <a href="http://www.mcall.com/news/elections/mc-norco-i-voted-stickers-to-return-20170519-story.html">once again begin handing out “I Voted” stickers</a> beginning with the November 2017 general election. According to the Morning Call, although no one is sure why the county stopped handing them out, they think it was for budgetary reasons. &#8220;People started asking me, &#8216;Why don&#8217;t we get them? Why is my friend running around with an &#8220;I Voted&#8221; sticker?'&#8221; explained Councilman Ken Kraft who lead the charge to bring back the stickers.</p>
<p><strong>And in more good news</strong>, the Veteran of Foreign Wars (VFW) in Lauderdale County, Mississippi <a href="http://www.wtok.com/content/news/Voting-stickers-presented-to-Lauderdale-Co-Election-Commission-423242734.html">presented the county with 45,000 “I Voted” stickers</a>. This will be the first time the county passes out the stickers. &#8220;The stickers are real important because we want to know that they can go out and be proud that they voted and wear it and maybe get more awareness to get more people to the polls. Without the voters we cant make a difference until the voters show up,&#8221; Natalie Copeland, a member of the Ladies Auxiliary of VFW Post 12124 told WTOK.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Update</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Update</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation:</strong> A bill has been reintroduced into the House which mandates that no voter should have to wait in line for more than hour to cast a ballot. <a href="http://www.publicnewsservice.org/2017-05-18/civic-engagement/bill-to-reduce-waiting-time-at-polls-reintroduced/a57738-1">The Voting Access Act</a> establishes standards for staffing and placement of polling locations.</p>
<p><strong>Alabama:</strong> The Legislature has approved a bill that would automatically restore the voting rights of “many” ex-felons. The bill more clearly defines the term “<a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/05/alabama_legislature_approves_b.html">moral turpitude</a>”. The legislation limits the term to less than 50 specific felonies.</p>
<p>Also in Alabama, a bill to prohibit people from <a href="http://www.timesdaily.com/news/state-capital/crossover-voting-bill-clears-legislature/article_c2c1ab43-dcc4-56c3-9f8f-da33f8425e30.html">voting in a political party’s runoff</a> if they voted in the other party’s preceding primary has been approved by the Legislature and now awaits the governor’s signature.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> The House voted 78 to 70 for a resolution authorizing a referendum on a constitutional amendment allowing <a href="https://ctmirror.org/2017/05/23/house-takes-step-on-long-road-to-early-voting-in-connecticut/">early voting</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> The Senate has approved legislation that would <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/23/recount-costs/102057704/">double recount fees</a> for a candidate who lost an election by more than 5 percentage points. Rates would go from $125 to $250 per precinct. It would not alter the rates for candidates who lost by fewer than 50 votes or 0.5 percentage points.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> Secretary of State Steve Simon is supporting legislation that would create five uniform dates throughout the year when a <a href="http://www.southernminn.com/the_kenyon_leader/news/article_9440050f-0e28-5a62-9386-e186576d38fb.html">special election</a> for vacancies in local elections or for ballot questions would be allowed to be held.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> With the deadline for the legislative session looming, lawmakers approved a bill that will allow counties to establish <a href="http://mynews4.com/news/politics/lawmakers-ok-sick-leave-voter-center-bills-before-deadline">vote centers</a> open to all eligible residents regardless of their home’s proximity to the polling place.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Lawmakers are considering a measure that proposes amending absentee ballot forms to say that <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/23/measure-would-clarify-absentee-voter-signature-rul/">the signature must match the signature on the affidavit envelope</a> in which the ballot is returned.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: The Senate has approved legislation that would <a href="http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/275010/senate-passes-bill-to-hold-all-primaries-in-august-political-divide-remains/">consolidate federal and state primary elections</a> to the third Tuesday in August. The Assembly has approved a bill that would consolidate the elections to the fourth Tuesday in June.</p>
<p>Also in New York, the New York City council has approved legislation that will require the Campaign Finance Board to send registered voters a <a href="http://observer.com/2017/05/ritchie-torres-voter-guide-history-campaign-finance-board/">four-year voting record</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> By a 95-54 vote following a six-hour debate, the House has approved Senate Bill 5 that would relax some of the rules governing Texas’ strict <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/05/23/texas-house-backs-voter-id-overhaul-changes/">voter ID law</a>. SB 5 would add options for voters who say they cannot “reasonably” obtain one of seven forms of required ID, and it would create criminal penalties — which House members&nbsp;reduced on&nbsp;Tuesday — for&nbsp;those who falsely claim they need to choose from the expanded list of options.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Update</h2>
														<p><strong>V.&nbsp; Legal Update</strong></p>
<p><strong>National:</strong> The American Civil Liberties Union has sent <a href="http://www.nh1.com/news/aclu-takes-legal-action-after-president-trump-launches-committee-to-deal-with-voter-fraud/">Freedom of Information Act requests</a> to Kansas, Indiana, Maine and New Hampshire. “We believe the outcome of the commission’s investigation is preordained,” said Dale Ho, director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. “It’s time to shed light on whether any commission members were crafting policy recommendations before their investigation was launched or the commission was even formally announced. If they’ve got evidence, it’s time to stop hiding and start sharing.”</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Clay County Circuit Judge Gary Wilkinson has upheld an <a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/public-safety/2017-05-19/judge-tosses-lawsuit-challenging-putnam-county-sheriff-s-election">election for Putnam County sheriff</a> that was decided by only 16 votes. In his 21-page ruling, Wilkinson concluded that it reflected the will of the voters and that the challenger did not prove a number of controversial ballots were sufficient to sway, or cast doubts on the results.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> The state’s highest court has ruled that <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2017/05/23/maine-high-court-says-ranked-choice-voting-is-unconstitutional/">ranked choice voting</a>, approved by the voters in 2016 is unconstitutional. In a unanimous advisory opinion, the seven justices on the Maine Supreme Judicial Court acknowledged the validity of citizen-initiative ballot questions but noted that even citizen-enacted laws can be unconstitutional. “The object must always be to ‘ascertain the will of the people,&#8217;” the court wrote. “Nonetheless, when a statute – including one enacted by citizen initiative – conflicts with a constitutional provision, the constitution prevails.”</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> According to Secretary of State Jon Husted, 22 people have been referred for prosecution for voting in both Ohio and another state in 2016. “We reviewed every reported case of voter suppression and voter fraud and are sharing those facts to inform the discussion on election integrity,&#8221; Husted told The Toledo Blade. “Once again our review shows that while rare, voting fraud does occur. But more importantly, we are holding those accountable who violate our election laws,” Mr. Husted said.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina:</strong> Richland County, South Carolina has reached an agreement with Office of Civil Rights to <a href="http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article152178557.html">bring 49 polling places into accordance</a> with the American with Disabilities Act. The county has until June to make the sites accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Attorney General Ken Paxton has issued a ruling that 262 men <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Paxton-rules-violent-sex-offenders-can-vote-by-11156252.php">housed in treatment center for sexual offenses are allowed to cast ballots by mail</a>. The men at the facility have completed their prison sentences, but are civilly committed to the facility. Paxton’s ruling means that under Texas law, they are permitted to cast their ballots. The ruling comes after about 100 ballots from offenders at the facility were tossed in November 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Attorney General Brad Schimel has <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/22/attorney-general-brad-schimel-asks-u-s-supreme-court-block-order-voting-maps/337619001/">filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court</a> seeking to have the court block a lower court ruling that would force state lawmakers to redraw legislative maps by November. “Wisconsin should not be required to invest the considerable time, effort&nbsp;and taxpayer resources required to redraw district maps, especially when the case is likely to be reversed,” Schimel said in a statement.&nbsp;</p></p>

DEFCON founder Jeff Moss (also known as Dark Tangent) said he’s concerned that no one has proven where the soft spots are — and the combination of non-disclosure agreements and private contracts have allowed misinformation to take root. “Pretty much, just like everything else, it’s time for hackers to come in and tell you what’s possible and what’s not,” Moss told <em>Politico</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Fifteen years after Arizona launched online voter registration the state is set <a href="http://www.prescottenews.com/index.php/news/current-news/item/30041-secretary-reagan-seeks-updated-voter-registration-system">to build a new voter registration system</a>. The state partnered with Gartner Consulting which took six months to conduct comprehensive interviews with local election officials and voter registration personnel. “We all see this as an exciting opportunity to further secure our registration data and make needed improvements to a cumbersome and outdated system,” said Secretary Reagan. “Once we receive the proposals, our counties will be able to determine which solution works best for them moving forward.”</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> For a brief period of time on voter registration deadline day the state’s online voter registration system was <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/townnews/politics/virginia-elections-website-shows-security-warnings-on-last-day-to/article_6e54f61f-e0e2-5161-bd3f-ceb2d18c7cc1.html">displaying warning messages saying the state’s website was unsecure</a>. According to the <em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em> the issue lasted about an hour and was fixed shortly after officials were notified. Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortes told the paper in an email that the change occurred during a “broader site security enhancement” that “should not have been implemented” Monday.</p></p>

							<h2>Electionline Underwriting</h2>
														<p><em>&nbsp;</em><strong>XI. Electionline Underwriting</strong></p>
<p>For 15 years, electionline.org has brought you all the election administration reform news and information of the day through electionlineToday and of the week through our weekly newsletter electionlineWeekly.</p>
<p>Because of the generosity of such organizations as The Pew Charitable Trusts, Democracy Fund and the Hewlett Foundation we were able to bring you that news and information for free and free of advertising.</p>
<p>In order to continue providing you with the important news of the day and week we are now offering monthly underwriting for our daily and weekly postings (think more NPR, less local radio and television).</p>
<p>Underwriting will be available for electionlineToday, the weekly email that reaches about 4,800 inboxes each week and the weekly newsletter. Underwriting is available on a per-month basis and costs $2,500 per section per month. The underwriting is available on a first come, first-served basis. Each section will be exclusive to one underwriter per month.</p>
<p>We will accept underwriting from a variety of entities in the elections world, but will not accept political advertising.</p>
<p>Job posting and marketplace listings from elections offices seeking to sell/trade voting equipment will remain free of charge.</p>
<p>Reservations are now available. If you are interested in underwriting a section of election for a month (or more), please email us at <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">mmoretti@electionline.org</a></p></p>
