							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the eve of NVRD, a look at the state of registration</strong><br /><em>Paper may be new king in polling places, but it&#8217;s old news for registration<br /></em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>electionline</p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to include comments from the Arizona secretary of state’s office.</em></p>
<p>The year was 2002. Facebook was just a dream in a college student’s eye. The president was four years from being able to send his first Tweet and most of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/">Stranger Things</a> kids hadn’t even been born yet.</p>
<p>And even though only just over half of the population had <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/virginia/archive/webstats.html">access to the Internet at home</a>, the state of <a href="https://www.azsos.gov/">Arizona</a> boldly stepped into the abyss and became the first state in the country to allow residents to register to vote online.</p>
<p>Now, 15 years later, as we approach <a href="https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/">National Voter Registration Day</a>, and even though <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/09/19/russia-hacking-election-fears-prompts-states-to-switch-to-paper-ballots/666020001/">paper</a> is all the talk these days, there are more ways for people to get registered to vote than ever before and most those ways don’t involve paper at all.</p>
<p><strong>Online Voter Registration</strong><br />Since launching in 2002, online voter registration in Arizona has been the most popular method of registration. Since 2010, the state has registered approximately 1.8 million people online. The state has also saved approximately $1.5 million dollars.</p>
<p>Currently, Arizona’s online voter registration system is maintained as an overnight batching process for voter registrations applications that were received from the prior day. Matt Roberts, spokesman for the secretary of state’s office said that although this process works successfully, they would prefer and recommend to other states a real-time submission of voter registration applications.</p>
<p>“As we move forward with technology advancements, we look for ways to maintain the most secure online system while also providing ease of usability for voters and our state’s voter registration officials,” Roberts said. “One of our future enhancements may include a real-time interface between MVD and our statewide voter registration database, providing faster validation checks and a more streamlined process for changes/updates to existing voter registration records.</p>
<p>As of September 2017, 35 states and the District of Columbia offer online voter registration Tennessee was the most recent state to join the growing list.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/">National Conference of State Legislatures</a> (NCSL), an additional three states have approved legislation to enact OVR.</p>
<p>But what about those 12 hold outs?</p>
<p>“Some of these states have introduced and debated online voter registration this year, and others have not. It&#8217;s possible that last year&#8217;s elections, with concerns raised about cybersecurity, may have made a few states pause,” explained Wendy Underhill, program director, Elections and Redistricting, NCSL. “Even though online registration does not link to online voting, there may have been some understandable hesitation to push it in 2017.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>Underhill said that she’s heard informally that a few stats may look at it next year, but as she pointed out, introductions don’t necessarily lead to enactments.</p>
<p>She also noted that about the same number of states offer some form of early, in-person voting as offer OVR.</p>
<p>“And my colleagues at NCSL who cover issues besides elections say it&#8217;s not uncommon for a trend to be adopted by about 2/3 of the states, and then not move further,” Underhill said. “It&#8217;s the nature of federalism, that states don&#8217;t all move together.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Voter Registration</strong><br />In 2016, <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2016/1793-electionlineweekly-february-4-2016">Oregon</a> became the first state in the nation to implement <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx">automatic voter registration</a>. To-date, nine states and the District of Columbia have approved AVR, although only three have implemented it thus far.</p>
<p>But how exactly is automatic voter registration defined? NCSL’s Underhill said that’s been an issue.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;d say that it is tricky to define the difference between automatic voter registration and a well-run motor voter process, where registration applications are automatically sent from the motor vehicle agency to the voter registration authorities,” Underhill said. “It&#8217;s the difference between opt-out, and opt-in, and about semantics.”</p>
<p>Oregon is the only state that literally automatically registers voters at the DMV and then gives the registrant the choice to opt-out at a later date. All the other states and DC allow a potential voter to opt-out at the point of service.</p>
<p>“We expect we&#8217;ll see at least a small handful of states consider ‘automatic voter registration’ again in 2018, even though the definitions may vary,” Underhill said. “Mostly, the sponsors have been Democrats, but not always. <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/100/PDF/100-0464.pdf">Illinois&#8217;</a> recently signed bill was bipartisan, and has a model for implementation that other states might like to review.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katy Hubler with Democracy Research, LLC added that as more states have looked at AVR legislation their concept of what automatic voter registration could look like has evolved.</p>
<p>“I think in the beginning everyone thought of it as something that had to involve the DMV, and possibly only the DMV. People forget sometimes that the NVRA covers a lot of other agencies as well, and more recent legislation and conversations about AVR have included other voter registration agencies, if they are able to sufficiently verify citizenship status and the like.”</p>
<p>Hubler noted that <a href="http://www.elections.alaska.gov/petitions/15PFVR/15PFVR-Proposed-Bill-Language.pdf">Alaska’s</a> process is worth highlighting.</p>
<p>“They found that they would catch more people to register by using the permanent fund dividend application than if they used the DMV as a source for automatic registrations, so that&#8217;s what their AVR process is tied to.”</p>
<p><strong>Election/Same Day Registration</strong><br />Currently, 14 states and the District of Columbia offer <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx">same day voter registration</a>. Hawaii has approved legislation but it’s not slated for implementation until 2018. Underhill thinks that election/same day registration may be the “next big thing” in voter registration.</p>
<p>“Typically this idea has been championed only by Democrats, but NCSL has had recent inquiries from Republicans. If technology can be used to assure that Election Day voters are indeed eligible and cannot vote twice, then security concerns are allayed,” Underhill said. “Recently I heard a nonpartisan person refer to Election Day registration as a fail-safe option.”</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Update</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Update</strong></p>
<p>Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colorado) and Sen. Corey Booker (D-New Jersey) have introduced federal legislation that would require the government to <a href="http://gazette.com/sen.-bennet-calls-for-investigation-of-trumps-election-integrity-panel/article/1611405">audit the president’s election commission</a>. &#8220;There is simply no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the United States,&#8221; Bennet said in a statement. &#8220;The commission is wasting taxpayer money investigating the president&#8217;s invented claims about voter fraud, while serious threats like Russian interference in our elections go unaddressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>During a 90-minute hearing of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, an advisory panel to Senate Democratic leadership, members stressed that voting rights must be at the top of Congress’ agenda and that the president’s election commission <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/nh-primary-source-democratic-senate-committee-hits-trump-election-panel/12441383">must be stopped</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> Although there have not been reports of Hawaii voters unregistering in large numbers following the data request from the presidential election commission, county elections officials do report that quite a few have <a href="http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/news/local-news/some-voters-concerned-about-records-sent-trump-commission">expressed concerns</a> and complained about the data sharing. Honolulu has not yet sent its list of voters because the election commission has not paid $153 in fees as requested.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> Secretary of State John Gale said he still needs <a href="http://nebraska.tv/news/local/secretary-of-state-will-hold-data-until-commission-answers-questions">more answers</a> from the elections commission about data security and access before he will release the state’s data.</p></p>

														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio says that the time has come</strong> to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/de-blasio-time-rethink-board-elections-model-article-1.3496341">rethink the city’s board of elections</a>. &#8220;I think the Board of Elections&#8217; time has come and gone,” DeBlasio told The <em>New York Daily News</em>. “I think it&#8217;s time for fundamental change. This model doesn&#8217;t work, period.” DeBlasio said that he would look to change state law to overhaul the board. “The first thing we could do, and there&#8217;s a piece of legislation that exists right now, is professionalize the agency and give the executive director a professional role not dependent on a political board to make fundamental changes in the operations,&#8221; de Blasio said.</p>
<p><strong>Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill announced</strong> how the <a href="http://www.wbrc.com/story/36380563/secretary-of-state-john-merrill-says-cross-over-voting-law-will-be-enforced">state plans to stop crossover voting</a> in the upcoming Senate runoff. The state outlawed crossover voting earlier this year and this will be the first election with the new law in place. Under the law, if a voter voted as a Republican or not at all in the special election, they are allowed to vote in the runoff, however if a voter voted as a Democrat, they may not vote. Poll workers will have a list of names of those who voted and how in the original special election and they will check that against those arriving to vote in the runoff.</p>
<p><strong>The American Civil Liberties Union is launching </strong>an effort to expand voting rights in all 50 state with their first state being Kansas. According to <em>McClatchy News Service</em>, The ACLU campaign, called <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article174293861.html">Let People Vote</a>, will forgo a federal approach to expanding voting rights. Instead, it will pressure each state to adopt individually tailored plans, including proposals such as creating independent redistricting commissions and restoring voting access for convicted felons. “We, as protectors of voting rights, we’ve been playing defense,” Faiz Shakir, ACLU’s national political director, told <em>McClatchy</em>. “And this is a moment to go on offense.”</p>
<p><strong>Leon County is honoring former Supervisor of Elections</strong> <a href="http://news.wfsu.org/post/local-officials-dedicate-new-voting-operations-center-honoring-ion-sancho">Ion Sancho</a> by naming the new election center building after him. It houses the new Supervisor of Elections’ administrative offices and operations center—now under one roof. It includes voter registration and candidate services, more parking, and a new early voting site.</p>
<p><strong>We think this is a great idea!</strong> The League of Women Voters of Kent, Ohio is teaming up with the Girl Scouts of North East Ohio on a program dubbed <a href="http://www.thesuburbanite.com/news/20170916/league-of-women-voters-girl-scouts-team-up-forvoter-girl-project">The VOTER Girl Project</a>. As part of the project, League members will provide instruction about citizenship, voting and leadership and the Scouts that attend the workshops can earn their citizenship badges.</p>
<p><strong>And here’s another great idea from Hernando County, Florida</strong>. Shirley Anderson, the supervisor of elections, has created a <a href="http://hernandosun.com/Wall-of-Honor-at-Supervisor-of-Elections-office">Wall of Honor</a> in the office that showcases county veterans and those who are actively servicing. Anderson told the <em>Hernando Sun</em> that the inspiration for the wall came after she started the “Vote in Honor of a Vet” program several years ago. She explained that the goal of the program is to advocate voter registration to youth within Hernando County while spreading knowledge about our military and conflicts that helped shape the United States of America.</p>
<p><strong>Personnel News</strong>: <strong><a href="http://www.dailyastorian.com/Local_News/20170915/clatsop-county-hires-new-clerk">Tracie Krevanko</a></strong> is the new Clatsop County, Oregon clerk.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois) has introduced the <a href="https://www.riverbender.com/articles/details/duckworth-champions-voting-rights-expansion-amid-attacks-on-the-right-to-vote-23586.cfm">Pre-Registration of Voters Everywhere Act (PROVE)</a>. The bill would enable citizens who are 16 and older to pre-register to vote in all 50 states and the District. The legislation is also sponsored by U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and a companion bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressmen Don Beyer (D-VA) and Keith Ellison (D-MN).</p>
<p>Sen Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island) has introduced a bill that would move Election Day from the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November to the <a href="http://wpri.com/2017/09/20/sen-jack-reed-lets-move-election-day-to-the-weekend-not-tuesday/">first full weekend in November</a>. “Americans should not have to choose between their workday and family responsibilities and participation in our democratic process,” Reed said. “It is time for Congress to update the law and make it more convenient for Americans to cast their ballots.” States would still be allowed to offer alternative voting options, such as early voting and voting by mail, under the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors have approved moving the county to the <a href="http://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/board-of-supervisors-approve-new-election-model/article_341803aa-98f7-11e7-99f9-67c0ac74d905.html">new elections model</a> proposed under the California Voter’s Choice Act. The June 5, 2018 statewide direct primary will be the first election under the vote center model.</p>
<p>Also in California, lawmakers have approved a bill that would move the state’s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/california-lawmakers-approve-presidential-primary-march/">presidential primary</a> to March. The bill now heads to Gov. Jerry Brown’s (D) desk. According to <em>The Associated Press</em>, he has not indicated whether or not he will sign it.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> Although the College Park city council voted 4 to 3 to <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-college-park-voting-20170916-story.html">allow noncitizens to vote</a> in local elections apparently a charter amendment needs six votes of the eight-member council to be approved. That rule was changed in June, and the mayor and council members said they neglected to note that they needed six votes. “We each accept our responsibility for not realizing the impact of the June charter amendment on Council procedures and we apologize to our residents,” the mayor and council said in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>Rhode Island:</strong> During a special session, both chambers of the Legislature approved a bill that will allow the state board of elections to develop a program for <a href="http://wpri.com/2017/09/19/6-key-bills-ri-lawmakers-did-and-didnt-approve-on-tuesday/">auditing</a> the initial results of voting machines to ensure their accuracy.

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Litigation</strong>: The U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals hear arguments last week in a case about whether or not residents of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands should be <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/residents-u-s-territories-ask-court-expand-voting-rights/">allowed to vote absentee in their former state of residence</a>. The case was brought by seven Illinois residents who argue that because federal law allows former residents living in the Northern Mariana Islands to vote via absentee and Illinois law allows those in America Samoa to vote as well, it should be extended to all territories.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> A three-judge panel of the Kansas Court of Appeals hear arguments this week over a suit filed by statistician Beth Clarkson who wants to use <a href="http://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article174144281.html">audit tapes of the state’s voting machines</a> to determine their accuracy. Clarkson is asking the judges to order a recount of votes on ballot questions in the 2014 election using the paper tapes generated by the voting machines.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed against the city of Augusta by a Maine State Prison inmate who said he was <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2017/09/14/judge-dismisses-maine-inmates-lawsuit-alleging-denial-of-voting-rights/">denied his right to vote</a> in the 2016 presidential election. The complainant, Raishawn Key, 35, sought the dismissal himself, saying he did not have the resources to pursue it while incarcerated.</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Plaintiffs in an ongoing suit against the state’s ban on <a href="http://hillsdalecollegian.com/2017/09/alumni-continue-waging-selfie-battle/">ballot selfies</a> have filed a motion to reply in their fight to amend a complaint they filed a year ago against Michigan election rules that prohibit people from photographing a marked ballot. The amended complaint would not only argue the ban on ballot photographs — which carries a maximum punishment of 90 days in jail, a $500 fine, and forfeiting one’s ballot — is a violation of free speech, but of voting rights, too.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit on behalf of three voters against the state for the its challenging process for <a href="http://nh1.com/news/lawsuit-challenges-absentee-ballot-signature-proce">validating signatures on absentee ballots</a>. The suit alleges that current law allows election officials to reject ballots without giving notice to the voter.</p>

Larsen was charged with voting in Burke and Ward counties, something Secretary of State Al Jaeger said hasn’t happened in the state since at least 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Seven people have been indicted on <a href="http://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/seven-indicted-for-illegally-registering-to-vote">illegal voting charges</a> in the 2012, 2015 and 2106 elections.

<p>Also in Ohio legal news, in their latest filings before the U.S. Supreme Court, the ACLU and Demos argue that targeting registered voters who fail to vote in a two-year period for eventual removal from the registration rolls is a tool for <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/ohio/articles/2017-09-18/parties-in-lawsuit-call-ohio-purges-voter-suppression">voter suppression</a>.</p></p>
