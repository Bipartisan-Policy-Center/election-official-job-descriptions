							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>President expected to launch commission on ‘election integrity’</strong><br /><em>Commission to be chaired by vice president</em></p>
<p>In a closed- door meeting with Congressional leaders and subsequently in numerous tweets shortly following his inauguration, President Donald J. Trump alleged that three to five million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 general election.</p>
<p>Although he had no evidence to back up his claims — including a claim that former New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte (R) would <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-voter-fraud-senators-meeting-234909">have been re-elected</a> had there not been voter fraud — Trump said he would sign an executive order to create a presidential commission to look into the alleged voter fraud.</p>
<p>The president’s claims were met with denial from state and local elections officials and great skepticism from others in the elections field. Even <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/25/trump-claims-3-to-5-million-illegal-votes/">Snopes.com</a> weighed in on the claim.</p>
<p>“The process had integrity. It was extremely well administered. And in the end, the people&#8217;s voice was heard and the process served voters well,&#8221; U.S. Election Assistance Commission Chair Matthew Masterson (R) <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/328670-gop-election-official-denies-voter-fraud-epidemic">told the</a> Center for Public Integrity.</p>
<p>Now, according to multiple media outlets, the president is expected to sign an executive order today (May 11) authorizing the establishment of an “election integrity” commission.</p>
<p>According to published reports, Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach will lead the commission which is supposed to include Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p><em>The Associated Press</em> <a href="http://www.startribune.com/ap-sources-trump-to-launch-panel-to-investigate-voter-fraud/421996333/">reports</a>, potential panel members include Secretaries of State Connie Lawson (R-Indiana), William Gardner (D-New Hampshire), Matthew Dunlap (D-Maine) and former Secretary of State Ken Blackwell (R-Ohio). Also among the reported potential commission members is U.S. Election Assistance Commissioner Christy McCormick (R).</p>
<p>At press time there are no reports of local elections officials on the commission.</p>
<p>A White House official told <em>The Associated Press</em> that the panel will “aim to ensure confidence in the integrity of federal elections while looking at vulnerabilities in the system and the possibility of improper voting and fraudulent voter registration and voting.”</p>
<p>In addition to questions about who will serve on the commission and what its guidelines will be, the question about how it will be funded also remains unanswered. In February Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that federal funds should not be used for such a commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;This sort of thing is handled at the state level, and the Democrats always claim there&#8217;s no election fraud at all. That is, of course, not true &#8212; election fraud does occur. There&#8217;s no evidence that it occurred in such a significant number that would have changed the presidential election, and I don&#8217;t think we ought to spend any federal money investigating that,&#8221; the Kentucky Republican <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/05/politics/mitch-mcconnell-voter-fraud-states-trump/">told</a> CNN.</p>
<p>The need for a presidentially-appointed commission has been questioned by members of both parties since the president first suggested it.</p>
<p>“If the administration decides to pursue some sort of investigation on that, we will certainly cooperate in any way that they ask for,” Sen. John Thune (R-South Dakota) said during an earlier GOP retreat <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-voter-fraud-20170511-story.html">according to</a> <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>. “But all I can tell you is this: We had an election; it was a decisive outcome. We have a new president, a new Congress and I view the election as history and we’re ready to roll up our sleeves and go to work for the American people.”</p>
<p>Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz who currently chairs the House Oversight Committee has said his committee <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/322667-house-oversight-chair-panel-will-not-investigate-trumps-voter">will not conduct an investigation</a> into the 2016 election.</p>
<p>&#8220;The president said that he thought there was &#8216;widespread voter fraud,'&#8221; Chaffetz told CNN&#8217;s &#8220;New Day&#8221; in early March.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any evidence of that. We&#8217;re not doing an investigation of that. Sometimes you do, sometimes you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>ElectionlineWeekly will have more on this next week.</p>

<p><strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NYCIVoted.jpeg" alt="NYCIVoted" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px none #000000; float: left;" width="150" height="147" />We have a winner!</strong> Congratulations to Marie Dagata, 59 and Scott Heinz, 56 of Bronxville for their winning design in the NYC Campaign Finance Board’s competition to <a href="http://www.nyccfb.info/media/press-releases/nyc-votes-announces-the-winning-design-in-the-i-voted-sticker-contest/">create a new “I Voted” sticker for New York City</a>. The winning design is based on the city’s subway system. &#8220;All the people of the boroughs meet together, pass each other, need each other in the subway and the voting booth,&#8221; said the winning designers, in reference to their submission. The CFB received more than 700 submissions, which they then narrowed down to 10 finalists. The winning design was chosen through a public vote of nearly 10,000 ballots that were cast via phone, computer and tablet and the CFB used ranked choice voting to choose the winner. Congratulations Marie and Scott and the people of New York City. We here at electionline <em>love</em> your design and are just a bit jealous.</p>
<p><strong>It’s always interesting when elections officials</strong> determine the <a href="http://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/each-may-vote-cost-more-than-hourly-minimum-wage">per-vote cost</a> of conducting an election and recently, Bexar County, Texas determined that with only an 11 percent turnout, each vote of the May 6 cost about $9.14. That’s almost $2 more than the minimum wage in Texas. Elections Administrator Jacque Callenen told News 4 San Antonio that the cost of running an election isn’t cheap, “But it’s the best we have. It’s democracy at its best.” And in Genesee County, Michigan the clerk’s office <a href="http://davisonindex.mihomepaper.com/news/2017-05-11/News/Surplus_of_ballots_for_May_election_costs_county_a.html">spent about $25,000 for ballots that weren’t used</a>. The county ordered 156,124 ballots and turnout was only 21,171. “It has become abundantly clear that May elections do not work,” Genesee County Clerk John Gleason said. “It is an unusual date for voters to participate.”</p>
<p><strong>This has just <a href="http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2017/05/10/marion-county-election-ballot-no-names/101486768/">not been Marion County, Oregon’s election</a></strong>. First it was reported that 318 residents received empty ballot envelopes and now 28 ballots have been left without candidate names. The empty envelopes was blamed on an inserting process mix-up and the blank ballots were the result of an error that occurred with the ballot software. County Clerk Bill Burgess said the printing problem has been resolved with manufacturer and now it’s just a matter of making sure those affected get new ballots before Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to the <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170504006300/en/Pitney-Bowes-Announces-Winners-2017-Brilliance-Awards">Hillsborough County, Florida Supervisor of Elections Office</a></strong> that was recently received a 2017 Brilliance Award from Pitney Bowes. In the Industry-Leading Compliance category, the Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections Office was recognized for its use of a Pitney Bowes Relia-Vote solution to manage the increased demand for mailed ballots, while also complying with state mandated deadlines and other regulations.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal:</strong> Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) recently sent a letter to the Senate appropriations committee seeking <a href="http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/332498-maine-sen-requests-160m-for-auditable-voting-machines">$160 million to supply states with voting machines</a> that provide a paper record. &#8220;A simple and effective solution to the cybersecurity vulnerability of our voting systems is available immediately: audit the results of elections instead of trying to secure computer systems,&#8221; King wrote in his letter according to <em>The Hill</em>.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> By a vote of 32-6, the California Senate has approved a measure to <a href="https://yubanet.com/california/california-senate-approves-prime-time-primary-bill-to-move-presidential-vote-from-near-last-to-top-tier-of-states/">move the state’s presidential primary</a> election up to March beginning in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> With the clock ticking, by a 31-4 vote the Senate has approved a bill that would <a href="http://gazette.com/open-primary-bill-for-colorado-loses-provision-linking-voters-to-parties/article/1602693">dictate how the new open primaries in the state are run</a>. The bill has passed out of a House committee, but must pass two votes on the House floor.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> House Bill 539, which was approved 99-11 by the House, will allow county clerks to <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/elgin-courier-news/news/ct-ecn-kane-election-judges-st-0505-20170504-story.html">reduce the number of judges</a> required at a voting precinct from five to three during primaries.</p>
<p>Also in Illinois, the Senate has approved Senate Bill 1933 that would <a href="http://www.sj-r.com/news/20170505/illinois-senate-oks-automatic-voter-registration">automatically register</a> Illinoisans to vote when they visit the secretary of state’s office or other state agencies. The bill would not automatically register those who obtain driver’s licenses.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> Gov. Terry Branstad (R) has signed <a href="http://www.kmaland.com/news/branstad-signs-sweeping-voter-id-bill-into-law/article_06dd0526-31ae-11e7-8599-9ba9ca3f7901.html">House File 516</a> into law. The Election Integrity Act will require voters to show a form of photo ID in order to cast a ballot, will shorten the time for absentee voting and provide guidelines for accessibility at polling places.</p>
<p><strong>Louisiana:</strong> The House has approved House Bill 272 which makes it <a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/05/house_passes_bill_wednesday_to.html">easier to recall</a> elected officials. The bill would retain the 40 percent requirements for voting district with 1,000 registered voters or fewer. But it seeks to repeal the requirement that recall organizers must gather signatures from at least one-third of registered voters in districts with more than 1,000 voters.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> The Bozeman city commission voted unanimously to hold an <a href="http://www.nbcmontana.com/news/ktvm/bozeman-approves-mail-in-ballot-for-november-election/489061165">all-vote-by-mail</a> election this November. The commissioners also agreed to cover the cost of the return postage.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> An attempt to <a href="http://journalstar.com/legislature/override-of-ex-felon-voting-rights-bill-fails/article_7be60993-0f18-5703-be00-5629e5f5ff64.html">override Gov. Pete Rickett’s veto</a> of a bill to expand ex-felon voting rights has failed. Ricketts vetoed a bill that would have eliminated the two-year waiting period for ex-felon to have their rights restored. The attempted override failed on a 23-23 vote.</p>
<p>Also in Nebraska, a <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/nebraska-legislature-votes-to-kill-voter-id-resolution/article_360cf620-34f7-11e7-8c8a-db1495ae6fca.html">voter ID proposal</a> was defeated with the threat of a filibuster.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Under Senate Bill 125, ex-offenders would have their <a href="https://knpr.org/headline/2017-05/bill-aims-restore-civil-rights-ex-felons">voting rights restored</a> a year after being paroled or put on probation. There would be exceptions for those convicted of crimes such as rape or murder.</p>
<p>Also in Nevada the Senate Legislative Operations and Elections Committee heard testimony this week on Assembly Bill 272, which gives county clerks the ability to establish vote centers, allows <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2017/may/11/voter-access-bill-trekking-through-senate-with-loo/">early voting to extend</a> to the Sunday before election and allows clerks to set up polling sites on tribal lands if requested by the tribes.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> The Stow City Council voted 6-0 to place an ordinance on this year’s general election ballot asking voters whether they want to amend the city’s charter to <a href="http://www.stowsentry.com/news%20local/2017/05/07/voters-to-decide-if-primaries-should-end">eliminate the September primary</a>. The county runs non-partisan elections and only uses the primaries to narrow down the number of candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma:</strong> Gov. Mary Fallin has signed Senate Bill 360 into law. Under the new law, the Oklahoma State Election Board must set up an <a href="http://newsok.com/article/5548138">online voter registration system</a> following the November 2017 elections. In 2015 the state approved online voter registration, but that system is still under construction. This new system will allow already registered voters to update their information.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> Gov. Terry McAuliffe has vetoed a bill that would have <a href="http://www.alexandrianews.org/2017/05/governor-mcauliffe-vetoes-bill-that-would-shorten-online-voter-registration-period/">shortened the time Virginian’s could register online to vote</a>. The bill had attempted to move the deadline to 5pm instead of 11:59pm on the deadline day. “Eligible Virginians should continue to be allowed to register up until 11:59 p.m. in order to make it easier for our busy citizens to participate in the electoral process. We should be working to reduce barriers faced by eligible Virginians when engaging in the franchise, rather than creating new ones,” McAuliffe wrote in his veto statement.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> House Bill 25, which would eliminate “one-punch” <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/05/05/bill-would-abolish-one-punch-voting-approved-texas-house/">or straight-ticket voting</a>, was approved 88-57.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> The Committee on Campaigns and Elections has approved House Bill 85 that will allow municipal officials to <a href="http://urbanmilwaukee.com/pressrelease/legislation-to-allow-municipal-officials-to-serve-as-election-officials-passes-assembly-committee-on-campaigns-and-elections/">serve as election officials</a>.</p></p>
