														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exit Interview: Angie Rogers</strong><br /><em>Longtime commissioner of elections looking forward to time with family &amp; friends</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>Louisiana’s longtime commissioner of elections Angie Rogers is set to retire soon and so electionline wanted to catch her before she left for one our Exit Interviews.</p>
<p>Angie has been Louisiana commissioner of elections for more than a decade, through several <a href="https://www.sos.la.gov/Pages/default.aspx">secretaries of state</a> and one life-changing hurricane.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Angie_Rogers.jpg" alt="Angie Rogers" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px none #000000; float: left;" width="276" height="414" />The Civil Service League recently honored Angie with the <a href="http://wwwcfprd.doa.louisiana.gov/LaNews/PublicPages/Dsp_PressRelease_Display.cfm?PressReleaseID=4868&amp;Rec_ID=0">Monte M. Lemann Award</a>, which is the highest civil service award given to administrators and unclassified employees in the state.</p>
<p>“When Louisiana voters go to the polls to cast their ballot on Election Day, the person behind the scenes, ensuring not only each citizen’s right to vote, but also their right to a fair and impartial election system, is Angie Rogers,” <a href="https://www.sos.la.gov/OurOffice/LearnAboutTomSchedler/Pages/default.aspx">Secretary of State Tom Schedler</a> said in a release on the announcement of the award.</p>
<p>“There is no greater demonstration of democracy than fair and reliable elections, and Angie has been integral to that work here in Louisiana under the leadership of several secretaries of state, including myself. Angie’s legal background, coupled with her instinctive determination and focus, provide the perfect framework in overseeing Louisiana’s complex election system. Her influence in an area so critical to our nation’s core beliefs and values is immeasurable and touches the lives of every one of Louisiana’s three million registered voters,” Schedler said.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I first met Angie in 2006 when I headed to New Orleans to cover the post-Katrina rescheduled mayoral election. Angie was beyond helpful to me in my work and her steadying hand was evident throughout that Election Day with genuinely happy and grateful voters heading to the polls with many of them seeing friends and neighbors for the first time since the storm. Thank you so much Angie for all you’ve done for electionline and the voters of Louisiana. We’ll miss you!</p>
<p><em>Why have you decided to retire at this time (clearly you’re nowhere near retirement age! 🙂 )?&nbsp;</em><br /> Thanks for the compliment Mindy and who knows what retirement age is right or not, but I felt like it was the right time for me after 33 years of state service! &nbsp;I decided to retire simply because I was eligible and young enough to hopefully have many wonderful years of doing all those things we have to put off or put on hold in order to work elections! &nbsp;Of course I plan to fill my days with family, friends, travel and just waking up late on Election Day!!</p>
<p> <em>What are you most proud of during your time in the Louisiana secretary of state’s office?&nbsp;</em><br /> I&#8217;m most proud of the team that we have built in Elections, which was divided by two different state departments just prior to my appointment as Commissioner of Elections. &nbsp;We are now one, not just in being one department but in being one team who thinks about each other and the reactions that our actions have on each other in the elections process from start to finish. &nbsp;And of course I have several highlights in my career at the Louisiana Secretary of State&#8217;s office that were tough times, like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, but those memories make me smile when I think about our team and what we did to help the citizens of Louisiana who were displaced all over our country be able to participate in the Orleans Mayoral election in 2006.</p>
<p> <em>What would you say is the most difficult thing you faced during your time running elections in Louisiana and how did you deal with it/what did you learn from it?&nbsp;</em><br /> I think the most difficult thing for me in elections from the first day that I started was in keeping everyone calm during the &#8220;fires&#8221; that seem to have to be put out each day leading up to an election and especially on Election Day. &nbsp;I try to manage from a calm state and help our leaders and elections partners weather the &#8220;fires&#8221; of elections and learn that while there is no perfect person (except God) or no perfect election, that we have the processes and people in place to be able to handle everything we need for a successful election.&nbsp;</p>
<p> <em>Is there anything you were not able to accomplish as elections commissioner that you really wish you had?&nbsp;</em><br /> I am retiring before we will invest in a new technology for voting in Louisiana and although I am not going to be part of that process, I feel good about the foundation that I was part of building in elections that I know will be part of the new voting system. &nbsp;</p>
<p> <em>What are your thoughts about women in positions of leadership in elections? There aren’t many at the state level despite dominance locally. What’s your advice to young women seeking to take the next step?</em><br /> All that I knew growing up was that I wanted to be a lawyer like my dad. I never thought about being a leader, it just came natural to me to become a lawyer and get a job and like most if not all of us in elections, I just stumbled into this field and then fell in love with it! &nbsp;I also don&#8217;t think of gender for leadership positions. &nbsp;I&#8217;m a firm believer in the best person should have the job. &nbsp;So my advice is to work hard and do something that you find passion in doing and the rest will fall into place.&nbsp;</p>
<p> <em>In an increasingly partisan world, what advice would you give to an up-and-coming elections official to deal with that?&nbsp;</em><br /> I will share the advice that I received from the late Al Ater, who was acting Secretary of State during the hardest times dealing with Hurricane Katrina and a wonderful leader to work with! &nbsp;Al reminded everyone that we are the referees in elections, just like the referees in football that do their best to make sure the game is played by the rules and fair. &nbsp;If you keep that in mind, you can&#8217;t go wrong! &nbsp;</p>
<p> <em>If you could design the perfect elections system, what would it look like?&nbsp;</em><br /> Oh that&#8217;s easy &#8230; I call it pajama voting where I can sit on my couch and vote in my pajama&#8217;s &#8230; smiley face!</p>
<p> <em>What innovations would you like to see the elections community work on in the future?&nbsp;</em><br /> I want to see less elections in Louisiana. &nbsp;We have worked hard on this for many years and we have reduced our elections to twice a year instead of four times a year. &nbsp;So while we have made great improvements, it is still too many elections in a year and it wears out the interest in voting in my opinion.</p>
<p> <em>Anything else that you would like to add would be greatly appreciated.</em><br /> In closing I&#8217;d like to say a big &#8220;THANK YOU&#8221; to all the wonderful people that I have had the privilege of meeting and working with not only in Louisiana but all over the country that I think fondly of, not only as colleagues but as friends! &nbsp;I have learned so much from so many and I will look with joy on my career days and wait patiently to find out what God has in store for me in this next exciting chapter of my journey. &nbsp;Best wishes to everyone in Elections! &nbsp;I will be thinking of you on Election Day!</p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>NBC News has another article</strong> on the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-s-voter-fraud-panel-has-gone-dark-members-don-n827796">radio silence from the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity</a>. While Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap (D) has been the most outspoken member of the commission about the silence, this article has quotes from New Hampshire Secretary of State William Gardner (D) and Alan King (D) the chief election official in Jefferson County, Alabama.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my understanding that this commission is supposed to submit its recommendations in March 2018,&#8221; King told the network. &#8220;I’m wondering when you take a two-and-half-month hiatus from meeting. &#8230; I obviously think anyone would have concerns how a deadline like that is supposed to be met.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The American Civil Liberties Union has added</strong> concerns about <a href="http://kmuw.org/post/aclu-adds-data-security-concerns-lawsuit-challenging-kobach-voter-fraud-commission">personal privacy and data security</a> to its list of complaints in a lawsuit against the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. According to KMUW, The ACLU lawsuit cites concerns that the data-gathering effort would become a target for hackers, and by way of example points to indications that Kansas’ multistate Crosscheck voter registration system may not be secure. The defendants have yet to file an answer to the ACLU’s original lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>According to <em>The Hill</em>, the Department of Homeland Security</strong> (DHS), the Election Assistance Commission and voting equipment industry and nonprofit groups met recently to&nbsp;launch an election security <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/365081-homeland-security-private-sector-launch-election-security-group">Sector Coordinating Council</a> (SCC). The SCC will represent the private sector as Homeland Security deliberates strategies and policies to protect critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>“The SCC framework provides a well-tested mechanism for sharing threat information between the Federal government and council partners, advancing risk-management efforts, and providing federal agencies with insight into the security landscape faced by industry,” David Wulf, acting deputy assistant secretary of the DHS Office of Infrastructure Protection said in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>Members of Congress from 18 of the 21 states</strong> that had their voting systems attacked in 2016 have sent a <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/12/rep_marcy_kaptur_seeks_electio.html">letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan</a> requesting briefings from the FBI and DHS. According to <em>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</em>, a spokeswoman for Ryan did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.</p></p>

<p><strong>With the state’s <a href="http://wvmetronews.com/2017/12/14/secretary-of-state-launches-new-campaign-to-educate-public-about-new-voter-id-law/">new voter ID law</a> set to take effect with the turn of the calendar to 2018</strong>, the West Virginia secretary of state’s office is working overtime to get the word out to the public. Secretary of State Mac Warner has launched the “Be Registered &amp; Be Ready to Vote” awareness campaign to address frequently asked questions about the new law. The law, which does not require a photo ID, may be one of the most lax ones in the country with voters being allowed to show anything from a voter registration card to bank or debit card to prove identity. That being said, the state is working hard to make sure that voters—and county clerks—are aware of the multitude of IDs that are acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>This is a new one for us.</strong> Chicago election officials are investigating complaints from residents alleging that they were approached by people <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/illinois/articles/2017-12-15/city-board-probes-claims-of-election-official-impersonators">impersonating employees of the board of elections</a>. According to the AP, Board Chairwoman Marisel Hernandez said in a Friday statement that city election officials do not go to voters&#8217; homes to ask about petition signatures.</p>
<p><strong>Election Day 2017</strong>: The rollercoaster election in Virginia continued this week when a recount in a Newport News-area House race ended up with a one-vote victory. The winning candidate — after the recount — began with recount down by about a dozen votes, but ended up “winning” by one. However, the following day, a three-judge panel reinstated one ballot for the “losing” candidate and <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/virginia-elections-board-to-pick-random-winner-in-tied-house/article_203dc6b1-0cb6-5027-bc22-10b4ebfad10d.html">now the race is tied</a>. The Virginia State Board of Elections will draw lots — slips of paper with each candidate’s name on them from an old film canister — on December 27. The ultimate winner of the election will most likely determine which party has control of the Virginia House of Delegates.</p>
<p><strong>Personnel News</strong>: <strong>Marcia Johnson-Blanco</strong>, co-director, Voting Rights Project, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law; and Clarissa <strong>Martínez-De-Castro</strong>, deputy vice president, Office of Research, Advocacy, and Legislation, UnidosUS have both been elected to the U.S. Vote Foundation’s executive board. <strong><a href="http://www.gcdailyworld.com/story/2468737.html">Tammy Woodall</a></strong>, former first deputy clerk is now the clerk of Greene County, Indiana. <strong><a href="http://www.timesrepublican.com/news/todays-news/2017/12/benson-talks-auditor-recorder-appointment/">Nan Benson</a></strong> was recently appointed the Marshall County, Iowa auditor and recorder.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;IV. Legisative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: A bill that was approved by the House Education and Workforce Committee would <a href="http://thehill.com/regulation/other/364793-gop-bill-scraps-voter-registration-requirements-for-colleges">no longer require colleges and universities to inform students about registering to vote</a>. According to <em>The Hill</em>, the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success and Prosperity through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act would nix language&nbsp;requiring that schools request&nbsp;voter registration forms&nbsp;from their state at least 120 days before the voter registration deadline,&nbsp;and send&nbsp;students an “electronic communication” exclusively about voter registration. It also&nbsp;eliminates language specifying schools are&nbsp;required to follow these requirements for general and special federal elections, state gubernatorial elections and elections for chief executives within the state. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sen. James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-South Carolina), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-California) have announced plans to introduce a bill to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senators-to-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-prevent-foreign-cyber-interference-in-elections/">improve and streamline information about cyber threats</a> between state and federal entities. The bill, which will include resources for states, is also intended to help states identify and prepare against cyber attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> The Gallatin County commission voted this week to stick with an <a href="https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/county/county-denies-request-to-appoint-election-administrator/article_e70872ee-f804-5b0d-872a-47661bfa13c2.html">elected elections administrator</a> instead of making this position an appointed one. Although they voted down the idea this time, they left the door open to taking up the matter again in the future once they had hammered out more details about the new role.</p>
<p><strong>Nebraska:</strong> State Sen. John Murante said that he will once again introduce legislation to enact <a href="http://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/not-giving-up-on-voter-id-push-state-sen-murante/article_b0f7d922-e4f1-11e7-a8f8-1b60b9a92147.html">voter ID</a>. He provided no details about the bill in advance of its introduction.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Sen. Ron Rice (D-Essex) has announced his intentions to introduce legislation in 2018 that would allow <a href="http://observer.com/2017/12/proposed-legislation-could-extend-voting-rights-to-convicted-criminals/">convicted felons, those on probation, people on parole and incarcerated individuals to vote in elections</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Mayor Bill Be Blasio has signed a bill into law that will allow New York City residents to <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/12/16/online-voter-registration/">register online to vote</a> from any computer even without a DMV-issued ID.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: Fargo City Commission voted 3-2 against putting a measure on the June ballot to <a href="http://www.kvrr.com/2017/12/19/fargo-city-commission-votes-reforming-citys-election-process/">reform the city’s election process</a>. The election reform recommendations were made by a task force formed more than a year ago.</p>
<p>Also in North Dakota, the Burleigh County commission voted to drop a plan for <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/north-dakota/articles/2017-12-19/burleigh-county-wont-change-people-vote-on-election-day">universal vote centers</a> after the state’s attorney informed the commission that the city of Bismarck has the jurisdiction to draw the precinct lines within city limits.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> House Democrats have announced their intentions to push a <a href="http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/politics/state/story/2017/dec/16/tennessee-house-democrats-renew-push-change-t/459340/">repeal or change to state voting laws</a> in the 2018 session including the state’s 2011 voter photo ID law.</p></p>

<p><strong>California:</strong> Add Los Angeles County to the list of states and counties that Judicial Watch has sued over what they are argue are <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-conservative-activist-group-files-a-1513316440-htmlstory.html">bloated voter rolls</a>. The suit argues that the county’s two lists of voters, one for active and one for inactive, should be combined into one and voters should be purged.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> A 16th Circuit Court judge will hear testimony about putting a question on the March 20, 2018 ballot asking Aurora residents if they want to <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/aurora-beacon-news/news/ct-abn-election-commission-st-1219-20171218-story.html">eliminate the Aurora Election Commission</a>. Proponents of eliminating the commission filed more than 1,000 petition signatures Friday with the Kane County Circuit Clerk&#8217;s office.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Federal Judge Nicholas Garaufis has signed the consent decree in the settlement between the New York City Board of Elections and activists in the suit filed over the city’s <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/judge-finalizes-voter-purge-settlement/">illegal purge of voters</a>. The board must review all the names of voters purged since July 1, 2013 and restore any voter who was removed in violation of state or federal election law. It&nbsp;also&nbsp;has to create a comprehensive remedial plan within 90 days that addresses the specific violations of the Election Law. If all parties don&#8217;t agree to the board&#8217;s plan, it&nbsp;could go back to court.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: The Santa Fe city council spent time this week hammering out details of how <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/santa-fe-city-council-sets-rules-for-ranked-choice-voting/article_6b93a46c-d53c-5974-bbc1-71aed1ea022b.html">ranked-choice voting</a> will work when the city begins using the voting system in 2018. Members of the council approved language to define a “majority” as well as ballot design.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: An Alamance County grand jury has indicted 12 people for <a href="http://www.wral.com/12-indicted-in-n-carolina-county-for-voting-as-felons/17187720/">violating state election laws</a>. According to WRAL, after elections, the State Board of Elections compares the state&#8217;s voter registration database against the state Department of Public Safety&#8217;s list of felons, and reviews voting history to determine if matches voted while still serving their sentences.</p>
<p><strong>South Carolina</strong>: Attorney General Alan Wilson has ruled that the state’s election agency does not need to <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/south-carolina-election-agency-can-withhold-cybersecurity-documents-attorney-general/article_f701f432-e4df-11e7-a35f-fb0bb1c8b408.html">publicly release documents</a> on how it is protecting voting systems.
