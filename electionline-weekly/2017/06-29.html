							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>Exit Interview: Michigan Elections Director Christopher Thomas<br /></strong><em>Thomas looking forward to having time to actually think about elections</em></p>
<p>There are somethings in life you can just count on and Christopher Thomas being up late on an election night has been one of those things for nearly forty years.</p>
<p>But the times they are a changing and Thomas, Michigan’s election director since 1981, is retiring on June 30.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ChrisThomas1.jpg" alt="ChrisThomas1" width="276" height="368" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px none #000000; float: left;" />Thomas has run the state’s elections through five gubernatorial administrations and four bosses from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>In his resignation letter Thomas wrote: “Enormous changes in the world of election administration have taken place over the past 40 years. The bureau has never been better prepared or more cohesive as they are right now. I am comfortable leaving Michigan elections in these hands.”</p>
<p>We snagged a bit of Thomas’ time before he set off for St. Joseph and the world and asked him a few questions about his tenure in the world of elections and what he sees in the future.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time for this interview and for your service to Michigan and the entire elections community.</p>
<p><em>Obviously everyone needs to retire at some point, but why now?</em></p>
<p>I’ve always been told that “you will know when it is time.” That is a good observation as it was true for me. I met Kristin a couple of years ago and soon knew that we would marry and not live in the Lansing area. Leaving after the 2016 made good sense to me. We married in March and I’m now moving to St. Joseph, Michigan to join her.</p>
<p><em>Basically your entire career has been in elections, what is about the administration of elections that kept you here for so long?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>It is a hard career to walk away from as the work is never finished. It isn’t like a technology project that is theoretically done on a date certain. Each election is obviously a deadline; however, each on usually has consequences that take you into the next cycle.</p>
<p>Frankly, it is comfortable field to work in. The people are great; it has purpose beyond making money; it has more challenges than one could wish for; it places you close enough to politics to observe, but not get burned (well, most of the time); if America stands for anything, this is it; it places you in contact with the widest possible array of professions: lawyers (what can I say), politicians, technology experts, academic wonks, accountants, media of all types, law enforcement, crusaders, professional irritants, public servants of many types, vendors, legislative and congressional staff. Essentially, never a dull moment.</p>
<p><em>What are you most proud of from your tenure as elections director?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In Michigan we have a legacy of non-partisan election administration even though we are part of the office of Secretary of State, a partisan office. This legacy was established by the first employees hire when the Bureau of Elections was established in the early 1950s. Bernard Apol set this legacy in stone. At the end of World War II Bernie worked with the Nuremberg trials; he brought that experience back to Michigan. &nbsp;I am most proud that I have maintained that legacy through the tenure of four Secretaries of State and have passed that on the to the Bureau staff who will carry on after me.</p>
<p><em>What will you miss most about working in elections?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>That’s easy: the people. All the good laws and the all the innovative technology are worthless without people who are fundamentally committed to the profession of a well-run election. This work is sacred.</p>
<p><em>What would you say is the most difficult thing you faced during your time running elections in Michigan and how did you deal with it/what did you learn from it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>There were many difficult and trying times. I’d have to say the development and rollout of the Qualified Voter File (our statewide VR system) gets top billing. With 1,600 jurisdictions and clerks this was an enormous undertaking that eventually worked out. Thank you Candice Miller for your patience! Also, I was fortunate to Tim Hanson as the point person for getting this project done correctly…Minnesota’s great loss!</p>
<p><em>Is there anything that you would have liked to accomplish as elections director that you weren’t able?</em></p>
<p>Heavens Yes! Every time I think voter registration is finally done and can be checked off the list of projects, something arises to improve the process. Online voter registration didn’t get done here, but hopefully is on the way. Election day needs work in Michigan and a pressure release with a secure option for all voters to vote before election day. Most states have already figured that out. Michigan is close on this too. We are implementing new voting systems statewide, which will require new procedures and law. Finally, I would like to build an election night reporting system that would become the archive of all elections held in the state. As you can see, there is a never ending list of projects in elections.</p>
<p><em>In an increasingly partisan world, what advice would you give to up-and-coming elections officials to deal with that?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>If you are a hardcore partisan who works campaigns or in the rough and tumble world of legislative politics, this career may not be for you. If you see the world through the prism of one political party or another you will face a tough challenge. In the beltway surrounding Washington and every state capital, the common think is there is no such thing as an ‘independent’. I’ve always thought that is the wrong distinction. The one I prefer is the degree to which a person in immersed in partisan politics, especially as a career. Many, many people tend to vote for one party or the other on a consistent basis; however, that is not their world view. It not how they process information and make decisions.</p>
<p>Partisan elected or appointed election officials are a fact of life in America. The challenge is to insulate those who do the work from the partisanship. In Michigan this has been accomplished by having the director in the civil service. I have worked for one Democratic Secretary of State and three Republican Secretaries of State. I have found no problem working for Secretaries of either party. They are the policy maker and I am the administrator. Other states have accomplished this objective through other means.</p>
<p><em>If you could write the rules, what would be your perfect voting system/process?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>A paper based system with electronic tabulation that can be securely programmed and results transmitted. Accommodating a variety of voting devices is also important. I think the optical scan voting system is a good result. Improvements can always be had, but the key for me is the paper ballot that the voter marks.</p>
<p><em>What innovations would you like to see the elections community work on in the future?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Someone needs to educate young people on civics. This has been lost and likely needed improvement long ago. I am amazed at how little the people know about elections. To a large extent the legitimacy of our system is dependent on participation of the governed. Also, I’d like to see an avenue into election administration open at the undergraduate level. It would be wonderful to expose college students interested in public administration or even political science to the administration of elections. It isn’t for everyone, but those who have the talent for it need exposure to the field.</p>
<p><em>What’s next for you?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I started working in elections in 1974. I think 2017 is a good time to disengage from the day-to-day. I have been invited onto a couple of boards, US Vote Foundation and MIT Election Data and Science Lab. I still have an interest in seeing the Presidential Commission on Election Administration recommendations implemented. Essentially, I don’t want another job. As I told Kevin Kennedy, we actually have time now to think about election issues rather than just move from one impending issue to another.</p>
<p>Kristin and I are going to travel and explore this country and others. St. Joseph and Benton Harbor will be my local communities where I am planning to be engaged in some type of civic work.</p>

														<p><strong>&nbsp;II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Senate Intelligence Committee has asked 21 states</strong> to <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/339880-senate-intel-asks-dhs-to-publicize-21-election-systems-targeted-by">make public information about 2016 Russian hacking efforts</a> into their election systems. According to The Hill, the request was made in a letter sent last week from Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC) and Mark Warner (D-Va.). “I do not see how Americans are made safer when they do not know which state elections systems Russia tried to hack,” Warner told <em>The Hill</em>.</p>
<p>T<strong>his week, Vice President Mike Pence held an <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/339923-pence-prepares-for-first-meeting-of-election-integrity-commission">organizational phone call</a> </strong>with members of the newly established Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. The commission will hold its first meeting in late July in Washington, D.C. &#8220;The integrity of the vote is a foundation of our democracy,&#8221; Pence said Wednesday, according to a White House press release. &#8220;This bipartisan commission will review ways to strengthen that integrity in order to protect and preserve the principle of one person, one vote.&#8221; A <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/28/readout-vice-presidents-call-presidential-advisory-commission-election">complete readout</a> of the call can be found here.</p>
<p><strong>Although Massachusetts teens are <a href="http://www.newburyportnews.com/news/local_news/teens-not-eager-to-register-to-vote/article_ec3baa86-c4dd-50b9-91c1-14f8afe46f93.html">allowed to pre-register to vote beginning at 16</a></strong>, a recent review by the secretary of state’s office found that many teens aren’t taking advantage of that option. According to Secretary of State William Galvin, only 2,270 teens pre-registered before the November 2016 election. According to the <em>Daily News,</em> that’s slightly more than 1 percent of the 16- and 17-year olds living in the state. “It’s a well-intentioned effort to increase participation,” Galvin told the paper. “But because it doesn’t allow you to vote immediately, it doesn’t get the same interest as other programs.”</p>
<p><strong>The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security</strong> has determined that there was no malicious intent from the attempted <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/malicious-intent-homeland-security-alleged-georgia-probing/66iZYiOt1U8sJtkkY8Yy1L/">intrusion into the Georgia voter registration database by DHS</a>. “Earlier today, I personally spoke with current DHS Secretary John Kelly and learned that the investigation is now complete,” Kemp said in a statement. “DHS did not knowingly attempt to breach Georgia’s firewall or hack our systems. Federal officials were able to re-create the event, and they have promised to provide a detailed report for my review.</p>
<p><strong>Vote centers</strong>: In a follow-up to last week’s item about vote centers, the <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jun/23/jps-approve-plan-for-voting-centers-201/?f=news-arkansas">Sebastian County, Arkansas</a> Quorum Court finally approved the use of countywide vote centers beginning with this September’s school election.

Frank was an alderwoman in the Village of Brokaw but could not vote for herself because she didn’t have an ID or the birth certificate necessary to obtain one. &#8220;Well, that was just a slap in the face,&#8221; Frank told Wisconsin Public Radio. &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t even look at my other papers. I had everything. I had my social security card. I had my marriage license. I had proof where I lived, and I had all the other requirements. The only thing I didn&#8217;t have was a birth certificate. I don&#8217;t feel that I should have to have a birth certificate to be able to vote.&#8221; The lawsuit continues.</p>

The survey is a deep dive into a wealth of election and voting data and includes findings such as an increase in registered voters since 2012, a growing number of Americans voting before Election Day, and a larger number of jurisdictions using technologies such as e-poll books.</p>
<p>“In the face of unique challenges last year, election officials across the country administered fair and accurate elections,” said EAC Chairman Matthew V. Masterson. “Today’s report gives us a detailed look inside that process and provides data we can use to improve future elections and voter experience. The EAC looks forward to turning the 2016 EAVS responses into resources for state and local election officials and the American voters they serve.”</p>

							<h2>VIP Update</h2>
														<p><strong>VIII. VIP Update</strong></p>
<p><strong>Request for Applications Signals Next Step in Voting Information Project Transition</strong></p>
<p>In March, the <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/election-initiatives/about/voting-information-project">Voting Information Project</a>&nbsp;(VIP) <a href="http://votinginfoproject.org/news/voting-information-project-seeks-new-home/">announced</a> that it had begun the process of identifying a new home for the project in 2018 and beyond.</p>
<p>Today, that transition takes another major step with the release of a request for applications (RFA) by The Pew Charitable Trusts. The RFA encourages entities to indicate their interest in and qualifications for taking on VIP’s work serving voters across the nation.</p>
<p>Applicants will have an opportunity to demonstrate how they will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adhere to the key VIP principles set out by a group of stakeholders from the fields of election administration, technology (including civic technology), and academia.</li>
<li>Manage the current and future technical challenges of aggregating official election data in the VIP form and ensuring the success of voter-facing tools established by VIP and its collaborative partners.</li>
<li>Maintain and nurture the strong relationships with state and local election officials that are instrumental to VIP’s success.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the RFA process, Pew hopes to identify a new home for VIP, which will assume responsibility in early 2018 and commit to its long-term success.</p>
<p>Expressions of interest are due Tuesday, July 11, 2017, and full responses are due Monday, Aug. 21. Pew and VIP will host an informational conference Tuesday, July 18, to further explain the RFA process and answer any questions that prospective applicants may have.</p>
<p>All of us associated with VIP are excited about this next stage and look forward to thoughtful and skilled responses from a variety of leaders in the field.</p>
<p>The RFA can be found <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/%7E/media/Assets/2017/06/EI_Request_for_Applications_Signals_Next_Step_in_Voting_Information_Project_Transition.pdf?la=en">here</a>.
