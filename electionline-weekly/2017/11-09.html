							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p>I. Election News This Week</p>
<p><strong>Exit Interview: Utah’s Mark Thomas</strong></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>Most people, especially younger generations, don’t expect to spend their entire career in one job and that’s why Utah’s Director of Elections Mark Thomas is moving on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/photo-mark-thomas.jpg" alt="photo mark thomas" width="200" height="276" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px none #000000; float: left;" />Thomas began in the Lieutenant Governor’s office right out of college in 2006. At the time he was tasked with helping the state transition to new voting equipment. He was appointed elections director in 2009.</p>
<p>Now, 12 years after he started, Thomas is moving on to a new job as chief of staff for the Utah Senate.</p>
<p>We chatted with Thomas as he prepared for his last election in Utah and prepared to leave the office he’s called “home” for more than a decade.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why have you decided to step down as Utah’s elections director?</strong></em></p>
<p>It’s a very hard and stressful job. I had two jobs actually. I was also the chief deputy for the lieutenant governor. It just takes a toll after some time and 12 years was my run and I felt like if there was an opportunity that came up this year, it would be a good time. The opportunity came up in the Senate and the things that I have learned and done here would work well there and I’m glad they agreed. It was time for a different pace and just something a little bit different.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are you most proud of during your tenure in elections?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>For me personally I think as I think about it, we have over the past 10 years, elections have become much more complicated and it’s also become more partisan and I felt like the elections office has done a really good job to be a fair and neutral executor of election laws in how we interpret those laws and how we enforce them. We’re a trusted office. Everyone has a lot of trust in the elections office. We’ve worked really hard to try and ensure that. Yes, it’s a partisan office, but I feel like we’ve done a really good job of being that trusted resource to go to and ask question. I felt like we always tried to make very reasonable decisions that people could understand. They may not have liked the decision we made, but they did understand it. We could have easily become a really partisan office, but we’ve navigated that.</p>
<p><em><strong>What would you say is the most difficult thing you faced during your time running elections in Utah and how did you deal with it/what did you learn from it? &nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>At least the biggest thing for our office, we never seemed to have all of the resources that we could have used. It was always difficult to be too be proactive with some of the things we wanted to do because we didn’t have all the resources. And even as I leave that’s still an issue. We just need more resources, particularly on our tech side. Trying to have the resources not to just keep up, but to be proactive and be imaginative of what we could do and better increase the election experience.</p>
<p>Also, what I think makes elections hard is most people think you only work a few days year. You work, work, work and if you do such a great job, pretty much no one cares because no one is calling you the day after the election saying “oh you did such a great job.” It’s hard to get that positive feedback and it’s fine you get used to that, it’s just one of those professions where your successes are not well known and any time you make a mistake they are VERY well-known and they are all over the newspaper and it’s your name that’s quoted all over the press.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is there anything you were not able to accomplish as elections director that you really wish you had?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think one of the things that’s puzzling for our office and even Utah in general, our voter participation numbers have been towards the bottom for a couple of decades now. It’s odd because Utah is civic minded. We’re number one in volunteers, we have a lot of people who want to run for office but when it comes to voter participation, it tends to be at the low end and we’ve always tried to struggle to figure out why that is. As a majority GOP state we’ve been able to do early voting, vote-by-mail, we’ve done a lot of things to increase participation and we’ve only had some very modest increases. I know some people would say that’s not our fault or even really our job, but I wish we could have figured that out and at least turned a corner and increase that.</p>
<p><em><strong>I</strong><strong>f you could design the prefect elections system, what would it look like?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>The perfect elections system? I think Utah has done a lot, I feel like we are fortunate to have a Legislature that trusts us. We offer early voting, on election day, we have vote centers and we have vote by mail. Those are a lot of options that makes it difficult to manage, but I do like that we have those and we’re making it really convenient for the voters.</p>
<p>Probably where I see other ways to improve elections systems is through automated voter registration and maybe not even automatic, but working with licenses bureaus and finding that data. We live in such a mobile society, people are moving all the time and I don’t’ know if it’s a huge barrier, but it would certainly make it a lot easier to be able to participate and just save time and effort on coming up with some really good voter registration system.</p>
<p>I really do think we’ll be there [voting online] at some point. I don’t think it’s any time soon. We know that tech exists that allows it, I think that’s pretty clear, now it’s coming up w/ a system that can be trusted and I think that’s the hardest part. I think there will be voters that will trust it and they are willing to take the risk. You think about our systems now, there are risks now, voters have to trust the system that it’s going to work and that ballot is going to be tabulated that’s taken years to build of course. With Internet voting it’s going to come with this younger generation.</p>
<p><em><strong>In an increasingly partisan world, what advice would you give to up-and-coming elections officials to deal with that?&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>First off, we listened. We were always listening more than we talked and I think that was helpful in allowing people to trust us. We were able to listen and understand, what their concerns and issues were.</p>
<p>I also think that everything we did was very careful, methodical and deliberate. We didn’t overreact and it’s so easy to get caught up in the moment, especially with these big issues that come with elections. It’s just really being careful.</p>
<p>I’d also say, just not taking it personal. I think sometimes people take things really personal and as you make decisions you are basing it on personal feelings you might have and maybe not based on actual it’s very easy to go down that route. It’s just a rabbit hole you don’t want to go down and it’s hard, very hard to shake stuff off and make a very careful decision on things. If people can remind themselves of that, not to take that personal and just really be careful. I think those would be some good advice.</p>
<p><em><strong>What innovations would you like to see the elections community work on in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>I know for me, one of the things that I would have liked to really have access to is data. In the elections world there is so much data that we are capturing there is even more that we could capture. To have someone in our office that just focuses on data that captures it correctly and runs all the numbers. As we talk about I think it’s just really taking the data and running the numbers and just trying to come up with more efficiencies and look at the election world through data, I think that’s where officials really should focus There is so much out there that we could learn and become better at by looking at the data.</p>

							<h2>Election Day 2017</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election Day 2017</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> At least 50 Michigan counties debuted <a href="http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/content/news/Michigan-Has-a-New-Voting-Experience-455857193.html">new voting equipment</a> this election and there were very few reports of problems other than in <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2017/11/07/voting-problems-detroit-election-day/840412001/">Detroit</a> where problems included issues with new machines and voting sites opening late. <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2017/11/new_election_equipment_deliver.html">Kalamazoo</a> was able to post election results in record time thanks to the new equipment.</p>
<p>Also in Detroit, unofficial election results have longtime <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/elections/2017/11/07/detroit-clerk-race-winfrey-gilchrist/107447530/">Clerk</a> Janice Winfrey keeping her seat 50.6 to 49.1 over newcomer Garlin Gilchrist. Gilchrist has said that he is <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2017/11/loser_in_detroit_clerk_race_ma.html">considering calling for a recount</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> Although the results weren’t in until Wednesday in Minneapolis’ mayoral race, the process was much improved from previous elections using <a href="http://www.startribune.com/clerk-minneapolis-mayoral-results-will-be-known-wednesday/456113553/">ranked choice voting</a>. When none of the candidates secured a majority of votes Tuesday night, <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/11/08/minneapolis-mayoral-race-2017-final-result">counting moved</a> on to Wednesday. The count came in an election that saw the <a href="http://www.mndaily.com/article/2017/11/n-voter-turnout-for-minneapolis-municipal-election-highest-in-decades">highest turnout</a> in two decades — 43 percent.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: In Allentown, voting machines were inoperable all morning after faulty machines were replaced with machines that also didn’t work. “Voters are voting on emergency ballots,’’ said Allan Roth, chairman of the <a href="http://www.app.com/story/news/local/2017/11/07/bad-voting-machines-replaced-bad-machines-forcing-use-paper-ballots-allentown/839876001/">Monmouth County</a> Board of Elections.&nbsp;“No voter has been turned away. They’re just voting on paper ballots.’’</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2017/11/lost_voter_registration_books_delay_voters_at_2_je.html">Jersey City</a>, voters were delayed about two hours Tuesday morning when poll workers could not locate the voter registration books for the polling place.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.njherald.com/20171109/rare-election-glitch-machine-out-of-calibration#//">Sussex County</a>, at least one of the touch-screen voting machines was out of calibration.</p>
<p>And in the governor’s race, Democrat Philip D. Murphy and his running mate Sheila Oliver were victorious. Oliver will now be the state’s <a href="http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2017/nov/07/sheila-oliver-becomes-first-black-lieutenant-gover/">chief elections official</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: Election Day 2017 in New York was a celebration of women’s suffrage, which was granted 100 years ago on November 6. Voters were given <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/suffragist-rosalie-jones-thanks-you-voting/">special suffrage “I Voted”</a> stickers and once again <a href="http://wxxinews.org/post/susan-b-anthony-grave-once-again-home-i-voted-stickers">Susan B. Anthony’s grave</a> became a hotbed of sticker activity on Election Day.</p>
<p>One polling place in <a href="http://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/local/2017/11/07/vestal-polling-place-evacuated-voters-redirected/841381001/">Broome County</a> had to be evacuated due to smoke from a fire. Voters were redirected to another nearby polling place. Voters in <a href="http://buffalonews.com/2017/11/07/buffalo-voter-reports-ripped-ballots-election-official-sees-no-widespread-problem/">Buffalo County</a> reported problems with ripped ballots. Officials from the Dept. of Justice were on hand in <a href="http://wxxinews.org/post/federal-inspectors-check-out-bilingual-accommodations-some-local-polling-places">Monroe County</a> to make sure that bilingual accommodations were available at polling places.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Election Day 2017 was the first experience for many with <a href="http://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/cleveland-metro/election-day-to-be-the-first-experience-with-many-using-e-poll-books-to-sign-in-at-polling-place">new e-poll books</a> and there were few reported problems.</p>
<p>Some issues included a polling place in <a href="http://www.timesreporter.com/news/20171107/few-minor-bumps-in-tuesdays-general-election-in-tuscarawas-county">Tuscarawas County</a> losing power for several hours. In <a href="http://www.indeonline.com/news/20171107/voters-run-into-problems-at-four-locations">Stark County</a>, voters temporarily had to use paper ballots when several precincts experienced problems with voting machines. In <a href="http://wkbn.com/2017/11/08/mahoning-county-elections-director-issue-with-machine-did-not-affect-election/">Mahoning County</a>, one tabulation machine that had not been reset was double counting ballots, but when the problem was discovered, the ballot were recounted.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Problems with election machines in <a href="http://www.ydr.com/story/news/2017/11/07/problem-york-county-voting-machines-could-allow-extra-votes-some-candidates/841010001/">York County</a> could have allowed a single voter to vote more than once for certain candidates on Tuesday. The issue was discovered Monday, but it was too late to reprogram the machines according to York County spokesman Mark Walters. According to the York Daily Record, the problem, a technical oversight caused by an&nbsp;employee of the York County Elections and Voter Registration office, impacted candidates who appeared twice in a single race where more than one candidate is elected. The county hopes to have the problem rectified by the <a href="http://www.heraldonline.com/news/local/article183436826.html">end of the week</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/city/election-philadelphia-voting-machines-republican-judge-fizzano-cannon-20171107.html">Philadelphia</a>, a candidate for Commonwealth Court had her name misspelled on the ballot.</p>
<p>Common Pleas Court Judge Richard E. McCormick, Jr. ordered that as many as 307 absentee ballots in Monessan (<a href="http://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/12921966-74/absentee-ballot-flap-could-delay-results-of-monessen-mayoral-race">Westmoreland County</a>) be impounded and uncounted until a hearing is held to determine their legality. According to the Pittsburgh Tribune, the court order came in response to a request for an emergency injunction filed late Tuesday by Democratic mayoral candidate Matthew Shorraw, who contended the county&#8217;s elections bureau improperly allowed residents to vote via absentee ballot solely because they are 65 or older.</p>
<p>And in <a href="http://abc27.com/2017/11/08/early-visit-to-polling-place-gets-man-arrested-for-dui/">Susquehanna Township</a>, a man was arrested for DUI after he showed up at his polling place to vote — on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> Driven in-part by a special congressional election, turnout in Salt Lake County topped 37 percent and 30 percent in Utah County. Although clerks had expressed concerns about late voters <a href="https://www.ksl.com/?sid=46194010&amp;nid=148&amp;title=salt-lake-utah-counties-estimate-average-election-turnout">flooding vote centers</a> on Election Day, that situation never materialized.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> In one of the most closely watched elections in the country numerous Virginia localities <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/with-eyes-of-nation-upon-virginia-a-smooth-showing-election/article_45cc31a9-06fc-55e5-bb69-3e9f441f9cc4.html">debuted new voting machines with few issues</a>. There were some problems with jammed machines in <a href="http://wtvr.com/2017/11/07/trust-votes-will-be-counted-henrico-official-says-after-machine-jams/">Henrico County</a> and machine problems in <a href="http://www.nbc12.com/story/36788428/polling-machine-in-chesterfield-goes-down-voters-using-provisional-ballots">Chesterfield</a>.</p>
<p>This was only the second election when thousands of <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/virginia-restoration-of-voting-rights_us_5a026556e4b092053058cd0e">former felons</a> were cast a ballot after having their rights restored by Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) in 2016.</p>
<p>Concerns were raised by the ACLU and others when reports surfaced that voters were receiving <a href="https://wamu.org/story/17/11/07/virginia-voters-report-robocalls-saying-polling-places-changed-officials-say-fake/">robo calls</a> informing them that their polling places had been relocated. Elections officials worked to spread the word that the calls were fake.</p>
<p><strong>Odds &amp; Ends</strong>: Oops! For a while on Tuesday, <a href="http://www.seattlemag.com/news-and-features/oops-washington-secretary-state-website-lists-wrong-election-day-date">King County, Washington</a> voters checking ballot dropbox information were informed by the secretary of state’s website that Election Day was November 8 not 7. The office quickly made the correction after it was alerted to the problem.</p>
<p>The biggest issue facing elections officials in <a href="http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/local/article183284471.html">Horry County, South Carolina</a> was county residents complaining to elections officials when they were told that they could not vote in the Myrtle Beach mayoral election.</p>
<p>Connecticut had some problems with dead people on Election Day. In <a href="http://www.theday.com/local-news/20171107/listed-as-deceased-montville-92-year-old-votes-from-dead">Montville</a>, 92-year-old Max Kopko was listed as deceased on the voter rolls despite the fact that he’s alive, well and showed up to vote on Tuesday. According to The Day, Kopko’s brother died earlier this year and that may have lead to the problem. And in <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article183218871.html">Danbury</a>, after a Republican candidate for office died on Saturday, Republicans wanted to leave the name on the ballot, but Secretary of State Denise Merrill said state law is clear that if a candidate dies from 24 days to 24 hours before an election, their name must be removed.</p>
<p>A council race in <a href="http://helenair.com/406mtsports/local/with-provisional-ballots-yet-to-be-counted-election-day-ends/article_63797cc8-cf37-5d70-830a-c31b133b3ddf.html">East Helena, Montana</a> ended in a tie but with two provisional ballots still to be counted, it remains to be seen if there will be the need for a recount.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fosters.com/news/20171107/trial-run-of-electronic-voter-check-in-goes-smoothly">Rochester, New Hampshire</a> used e-poll books for the first time in Tuesday’s election and reports are that they helped speed up the process.</p></p>

							<h2>Federal-State Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Federal-State Updates</strong></p>
<p>President Donald J. Trump’s <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/359392-trump-homeland-security-pick-worried-about-voting-machine-security">nominee for the Department of Homeland Security</a> testified before Congress this week. Kirstjen Nielsen testified that when she voted this week in Virginia, she pressed poll workers about the security of her vote.</p>
<p>“When I went to vote this week in the Virginia election, I was quite concerned with the scanning machine and started asking a variety of questions on what the security was on the scanning machine for the ballot. I think we all have to be very aware and work with the state and locals,” Nielsen said during her testimony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nielsen also committed to senators that on her watch, DHS would be proactive about notifying states and counties about possible cyberattacks on elections systems.</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Earlier this year the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ended its participation in the Interstate Voter Registration <a href="http://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2017/11/03/massachusetts-crosscheck-system">Crosscheck Program</a>. All of Massachusetts files were deleted from the program in March 2017. A spokesman for Secretary of State William Galvin told WBUR no one was removed from the state’s voter rolls “solely because they appeared on the Crosscheck lists.”</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: New Hampshire still has not forwarded the <a href="http://www.concordmonitor.com/Effort-to-send-New-Hampshire-voter-data-stalls-amid-uncertainty-in-Washington-DC-Bill-Gardner-Donald-Trump-13573419">state’s voter data</a> to the White House election commission. The state’s Attorney General had been reviewing the town-by-town checklists for publication since August, but that review is now complete. Secretary of State William Gardner, who serves on the election commission said his office has reached out to the commission’s executive director to find out how to securely transmit the data but has yet to hear back.</p></p>

<p><strong>The New York State Comptroller has released an </strong><a href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7296-ahead-of-election-day-comptroller-audit-highlights-board-of-elections-dysfunction"><strong>audit</strong> of the New York City Board of Elections</a> that highlights problems at the quasi-city agency. According to the report, at 82 sites, about 53 percent, auditors witnessed violations of federal and state election laws and also of the BOE’s own rules. At 14 percent of sites, affidavit ballots were mishandled, and at 10 percent of sites, voters received no assistance when they faced issues. Some poll workers even engaged in electioneering, telling voters which candidate to vote for. “We have uncovered deep dysfunction,” Stringer said at a news conference.</p>
<p><strong>When surveillance video surfaced of a Palmview, Texas</strong> councilwoman help voters in a polling site questions arose about <a href="http://www.themonitor.com/news/local/article_12acd35a-c03c-11e7-8f16-1f3e6af2d42c.html">why there was a video camera in the polling site</a>. City Manager Omar Romero told <em>The Monitor</em> that surveillance cameras have always been at the library voting site, but the footage surfaced after he received a public information request for it. Although Romero was legally allowed to release the footage and the cameras did fall under state guidelines Councilwoman Linda Sarabia is concerned about the impact the released footage may have. “It’s not about who wins the election, what’s at stake here is our right to vote,” she told <em>The Monitor</em>. “Turnout is low as it is, imagine what it’s going to be like now.”</p>
<p><strong>Necessity is the mother of invention</strong> and that’s exactly what happened when Reno County, Kansas elections officials realized they could not get the county’s voting machines into a storage space in a second-story attic. That’s when county maintenance tech Art Miller and his supervisor Jim Arneson came to the rescue. During his free time, Miller <a href="http://www.hutchnews.com/news/20171104/maintenance-workers-receive-kudos-for-inventiveness">built a pulley system</a> to get the machines up the stairs. Miller created the system piecemeal from mostly available parts. “Kudos to Art and Jim for keeping after it, with several designs,” Reno County Maintenance Director Harlan Depew told <em>The Hutchinson News</em>. “The end result is neat to watch.”</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/690/687556.pdf">Voters with Disabilities: Observations on Polling Place Accessibility and Related Federal Guidance</a></strong>&nbsp;– United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), October 2017: Per a Congressional request, the GAO examined access for people with disabilities at early voting and Election Day polling locations for the 2016 general election. Of the&nbsp;178 polling places observed, 60 percent had one or more potential impediments outside the locations, such as steep ramps outside buildings, lack of signage for accessible paths, and poor parking.</p>
<p>The GAO was able to fully examine the interiors of 137 locations. Of these 65 percent had a voting station with an accessible voting system that could impede the casting of a private and independent vote. This included &nbsp;voting stations not set up to accommodate people using wheelchairs as well as stations not set up to provide the same level of privacy for voters with disabilities that other voters had.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among its recommendations the GAO suggests the U.S. Department of Justice study federal accessibility requirements and how they are implemented related to in-person early voting.&nbsp;</p>

Ford School of Public Policy, November 2017: Highlights from this survey of local government&nbsp;officials in Michigan about election administration include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Officials in 91 percent of&nbsp;the state&#8217;s&nbsp;townships and cities&nbsp;are very confident in the ability of their jurisdictions to administer elections accurately.</li>
<li>The most common challenges reported related to recruiting poll workers. 29 percent said there were problems finding poll workers with the needed&nbsp;skills.</li>
<li>25 percent of respondents said&nbsp;the costs of administering elections are a problem for their&nbsp;budget.&nbsp;</li>
<li>67 percent&nbsp;of local officials support the state’s move&nbsp;to update voting equipment by August 2018.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>When asked about a variety of possible changes to the election process in the state, respondents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported no-excuse absentee voting, 66 percent in favor, 19 percent opposed; and supported&nbsp;synchronizing voter lists with other states, 50 percent in favor, 10 percent opposed.</li>
<li>Opposed same day registration, 66 percent opposed, 17 percent support; and opposed early voting, 50 percent opposed, 32 percent support.&nbsp;</li>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VI. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Debbie Dingell (D-Michigan) has introduced the Safeguarding Election Infrastructure Act which requires voting machines funded with HAVA money <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/359368-dem-rep-bill-would-require-paper-voting-recounts-in-close-elections">print a paper receipt</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Gov. Paul LePage (R) allowed a bill to delay the implementation of voter-approved <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2017/11/03/politics/lepage-lets-bill-that-would-kill-ranked-choice-voting-in-2021-become-law/">ranked choice voting</a> to become law by not signing it. “I encourage the people who want to have a people’s veto to bring it in. The Supreme Court has already said it is unconstitutional, so let the courts decide,” he said according to the <em>Bangor Daily News</em>. On Monday, Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap approved petitions for the <a href="http://mainepublic.org/post/ranked-choice-voting-supporters-collect-signatures-people-s-veto-polling-places">people’s veto</a>. Those spearheading the veto have 90 days to collect 61,123 valid signatures.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: <a href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/7303-as-new-york-votes-a-push-to-allow-17-year-olds-the-ballot-next">The Young Voter Act</a> would allow 17-year-olds to cast a ballot in state and local elections. The legislation would also require that all students in public high schools receive at least eight hours of formal civics education and that schools provide voter registration forms to students when they turn 17.</p>
<p><strong>South Dakota</strong>: Supporters of a ballot measure that would allow South Dakota counties to switch to elections <a href="http://www.kdlt.com/2017/11/06/20k-signatures-submitted-for-vote-by-mail-measure/">conducted entirely by mail</a> ballot have turned in nearly 20,000 signatures to put it before voters in 2018. The measure needs 14,000 signatures and the secretary of state’s office will conduct a random sampling for validity.</p>
<p><strong>Wyoming:</strong> <em>The Cody Enterprise</em> has a fascinating story about the County Clerks Association of Wyoming (CCAW) attempt to push legislators to consider introducing and approving a bill that would allow counties to move to <a href="http://www.codyenterprise.com/news/local/article_2ed77e30-c33a-11e7-9c39-4f675ec42859.html">vote-by-mail</a>. According to the paper, in 2016, approached the Legislature’s Joint Corporations, Elections and Public Subdivisions Committee on at least three occasions seeking to explore moving to a vote-by-mail/vote center model. Those opposing the move cited concerns about fraud or making it “too easy” for people to vote.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>VII. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> The League of United Latin American Citizens and the Arizona Students Association have filed suit charging that thousands of Arizonans are being <a href="http://azdailysun.com/news/local/arizona-lawsuit-contends-voters-are-being-disenfranchised/article_446701ef-2406-5987-83ca-24b273f39f1d.html">illegally denied the right to vote</a> in federal elections. The suit contends that state law is trumping federal law and disenfranchising thousands.</p>
<p><strong>Mississippi:</strong> A candidate for the Mississippi House of Representatives will finally get the chance to <a href="http://www.wtva.com/content/state/Hearing-on-2015-Mississippi-election-dispute-set-for-April-456140723.html?ref=723">challenge a 2015 election loss in court</a> in April. <em>The Enterprise-Journal</em> reports that specially appointed Pike County Circuit Judge James Bell has scheduled the challenge for April 30. Bell also scheduled a ballot review in March. The candidate alleges voting irregularities, illegal campaigning and mishandled ballots. Myers and election officials deny wrongdoing.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Democrats are asking a judge to halt <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/democrats-ask-court-to-halt-recall-efforts-of-nevada-senators/">three potential recall elections</a>. The suit claims that the recalls would put a burden on the plaintiffs’ right to vote.</p>
<p><strong>New Jersey</strong>: Judge Julio Mendez ruled this week that <a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/politics/judge-denies-request-in-atlantic-city-ballot-case/article_a016f5b4-6059-599b-ab8f-29f281efc2d7.html">state law does not allow for the review of mail-in ballots before an election</a>. At the center of the suit are 6,100 absentee ballots in Atlantic County. “It would create a very chaotic process that would delay, substantially, the ability of the board to count the votes and issue results, which would undermine the electoral process,” Mendez said, adding the campaign can review the materials as part of an election challenge.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: First Judicial District Court Judge David Thomson ruled this week that the <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/judge-state-workers-can-take-paid-leave-to-vote-in/article_6f7b5902-bd30-51cd-aab6-5a8e06ef652c.html">state government’s voting leave policy</a> must extend to municipal elections. The suit was filed by two state employees in October.</p>
<p>Also in New Mexico, Judge Greg Shaffer issued an order commanding the city of Santa Fe to use <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/move-to-recuse-judge-clouds-ranked-choice-voting-case/article_c2c82cce-9835-5517-a4cd-89f1c8b6c8cf.html">ranked-choice voting</a> in the March municipal election. Shaffer did allow the city at least one more chance to argue why it isn’t ready to switch to the new system.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: New York Supreme Court Justice Erika Edwards issued an order last week for the <a href="https://www.timesledger.com/stories/2017/44/lefrakvoting_2017_11_03_q.html">immediate relocation of five election districts</a> back the Lefrak City. The city’s board of elections had removed the election districts from the housing complex. Edwards call the move “irrational, arbitrary and capricious.”</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Judge Paul Ridgeway ruledthat he lacks the authority to prevent counties from using a <a href="http://www.wral.com/judge-won-t-block-use-of-polling-site-software/17095702/">software program to check in voters</a> at polling sites Tuesday, despite the concerns of state elections officials. The State Board of Elections &amp; Ethics Enforcement had enough questions about the functionality and security of the EViD software that they determined it shouldn&#8217;t be used in this year&#8217;s municipal elections.</p></p>
