							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Friend Vote</strong><br /><em>Website means to put a little peer pressure on friends to encourage participation</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>Electionline.org</p>
<p>Our good friends at <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/">Merriam-Webster</a> define peer pressure as: a feeling that one must do the same things as other people of one&#8217;s age and social group in order to be liked or respected by them.</p>
<p>Concerned about voter apathy, a group from the University of Montana created <a href="http://thefriendvote.com/">The Friend Vote</a> website in order to allow Missoula County, Montana residents to put a little positive peer pressure on their friends, neighbors and colleagues.</p>
<p>The Friend Vote allows people to see how — but obviously not for who — friends have voted and is designed to help people motivate their friends to get registered and vote.</p>
<p>The Friend Vote allows people to search public voting records to find out if their friends are registered and regularly voting. Then, it provides tools and guidance to help people reach out to their friends with targeted messages to get them to vote, or keep them voting.</p>
<p>The project was lead by <a href="http://hs.umt.edu/polsci/people/default.php?id=3027">Sara Rinfret</a>, associate professor of political science and public administration, <a href="http://www.bber.umt.edu/Staff/Ward.asp">Bryce Ward</a>, health care director/associate director of the University of Montana’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research and <a href="http://www.business.umt.edu/faculty-staff/JustinAngle">Justin Angle</a> from the School of Business administration.</p>
<p>“We wanted to work together across disciplines and better understand how to use technology to encourage participation,” said Rinfret.</p>
<p>The Friend Vote currently uses the voter database from <a href="https://www.missoulacounty.us/government/administration/elections-office">Missoula County</a>. Election Administrator Rebecca Connors was an eager participant in the project.</p>
<p>“Election Administrators not only want to see 100 percent voter turnout for an election to ensure we have a robust democracy, but also because as someone who conducts elections and understands the time, money, energy, and people-power to make elections happen, we want to see voters utilize the services our office offers,” Connors said. “If knowing your friend&#8217;s participation rate encourages you to vote more, that&#8217;s a good thing! I would love to see this app increase local election turnout as those elections are just as important as a presidential one.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 700 people visited the site, but Ward said the registration page was a deterrent. Fewer than 100 registered.</p>
<p>Rinfert, they are working on crunching the data from the site and hope have more concrete results in early fall. Those who registered searched for 330 registered voters.</p>
<p>Those who registered mostly searched for high propensity voters. Seventy three percent of the registered voters whose record was viewed at least once had voted in 100 percent of eligible general elections since 2008. Only 32 of the registered voters searched were “low propensity” voters.</p>
<p>“We suspect this reflects high propensity voters discovering that their social networks consist of other high propensity voters. &nbsp;This raises an interesting issue of how to find people whose networks include more low propensity voters,” Ward said.</p>
<p>Ward said that anecdotally the researchers have gotten positive feedback about the site and that at least a few people used it to identify and engage low propensity voters in their social network.</p>
<p>“One person I know who owns a store identified that one of her workers was not regularly voting, so she made an extra effort to make sure that her worker was aware that she offered paid time off to go to the polls,” Ward said.</p>
<p>The website does have an opt-out option for anyone who wants to remove their information. Ward said only one person chose to opt-out.</p>
<p>“When the Missoulian article on The Friend Vote was published, I did receive two phone calls from voters caught off guard that their voting information was public,” Connor said. “I had to explain that we do not have record regarding how they voted, only that they voted in that election. That did not resolve their concerns, but I think the element of surprise that election information is public is what truly upset them. While the ballot is secret, voting is a very public process.”</p>
<p>In addition to time spent creating the concept, it took a few days to clean the data and program the website. The only costs were the cost of webhosting and a subscription to a cloud database platform. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The researchers are still considering next steps for the project.</p>
<p>“It seems like a tool that should be more widely available, but it needs to be targeted at people who (a) are willing to reach out to people who they know that do not vote and (b) actually know some people who do not vote regularly,” Ward said.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the Missoula County elections department has partnered with the University of Montana. Back in 2016, the county and university partnered together to <a href="https://electionline1.wpengine.com/index.php/2016/1854-electionlineweekly-april-14-2016">survey county residents</a> on their thoughts about the elections office.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re fortunate to work in a university town and have a local partnership with the University of Montana. The political science department assists us with scientific research, internships and brainstorming ideas to improve election services,” Connors said. “Students offer perspectives and ideas to help us be competitive in our industry and we in return reinforce the importance of elections with an emerging voting population. It&#8217;s a win-win for both of us!”<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"></p>

							<h2>Federal/State Update</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Federal/State Update</strong></p>
<p>In a 35-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly allowed the White House’s election integrity commission to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/federal-judge-allows-trump-commissions-nationwide-voter-data-request-to-go-forward/2017/07/24/83fa89c6-635d-11e7-84a1-a26b75ad39fe_story.html?utm_term=.046e2c74ec2b">move forward with seeking the voter data</a> from all 50 states and the District. Kollar-Kotelly ruled that the advisory panel is exempt from federal privacy review requirements, regardless of the additional risk it may pose to Americans’ information. “Neither the Commission or the Director of White House Information Technology — who is currently charged with collecting voter roll information on behalf of the Commission — are ‘agencies’&nbsp;” of the federal government subject to the court’s review in this matter, Kollar-Kotelly wrote. “To the extent the factual circumstances change, however — for example, if the . . . powers of the Commission expand beyond those of a purely advisory body — this determination may need to be revisited.”</p></p>

<p><strong>Ten years after being approved by voters, Memphis, Tennessee</strong> is <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/politics/elections/2017/07/20/memphis-scrap-city-council-runoff-elections-2019/492299001/">preparing to implement ranked choice voting in the 2019</a> city council elections. By moving to ranked choice voting, the city will be able to eliminate costly runoff elections which can run as high as $24 per vote. As part of the preparation to roll out RCV, the county will organize a large-scale, internal mock election to work out any kinks in the system and the city council will need to approve ordinances surrounding policy questions. “We&#8217;re going to have to spend a lot of money on voter education,&#8221; Shelby County Administrator of Elections Linda Phillips told The Commercial Appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Officials in Mercer County, New Jersey</strong> are investigating why <a href="http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2017/07/130_ballots_not_counted_after_getting_lost_in_the.html">more than 100 mail-in ballot arrived a month after the June primary</a>. According to New Jersey.com, Joanne Palmucci, chairwoman for the Mercer County Board of Elections, said the office was blindsided when it received about 130 mail-in ballots on July 6, a month after the state primary. All of the ballots were postmarked by the deadline. There were some from every municipality and both parties. Palmucci said the ballots were not misplaced at the county elections office, but by the U.S. Postal Service. &#8220;Somebody messed up, but it wasn&#8217;t the county,&#8221; Palmucci said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate, but there&#8217;s nothing we can do about it.&#8221; The USPS has said it is investigating the situation.</p>
<p><strong>The Navy has announced</strong> the <a href="http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=101413">elimination of seven shipboard collateral duties including Voting Officer</a>. Voting Officers ensure that members of the Navy understand their voting rights and how to register and vote absentee. According to the Navy News Service, the removal of these officers is part of a larger objective to remove unnecessary burdens and distractions from sailors. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about removing collateral duties,&#8221; said Moran. &#8220;It&#8217;s about taking a hard look at all the demands we put on our ships, squadrons and our Sailors, and refocusing our efforts on eliminating the unnecessary tasks that ultimately distract our Sailors from their primary duties.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A lot of thought goes into the choosing the perfect location</strong> for a polling site and the Washington County, Maryland Board of Elections has decided to relocate one of its early voting sites which is currently <a href="http://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/local/citing-jail-concerns-washington-county-election-board-books-new-early/article_edd735b1-3617-5330-acef-b77d08f19084.html">in a building near the county detention center</a>. The Board’s Attorney Roger Schlossberg told county commissioners that female voters are subject to verbal harassment from inmates in the yard and that voters will have to make their way through those using the day-reporting center.</p>

<p><strong>In Memoriam</strong>: We’d like to ask for your slight indulgence on this one. On July 22, legendary Washington, D.C. news anchor <strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/jim-vance-washingtons-longest-serving-local-news-anchor-is-dead-at-75/2017/07/22/7869297c-6ee4-11e7-b9e2-2056e768a7e5_story.html?utm_term=.55cc87299f6f">Jim Vance</a></strong> died. He was 75. Vance, as everyone referred to him, started at NBC4 in Washington, D.C. in 1969 and became anchor in 1972. He was charismatic and smart and a huge part of life for those of us that call D.C. home. He was on the air through every major event in the nation’s capital. Most of us do not remember a time when he was not on our televisions at the dinner hour. He was also very outspoken on many issues and that’s what we’d like to share with you here. This is a clip of <a href="http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Vances_View_Go_Vote_Washington-DC-400483221.html">Vance’s View from November 2016</a>. In it, Vance reads the riot act to those who were choosing to sit out the 2016 election. It’s good stuff, no matter what side of the aisle you’re on.</p></p>

The suit says that refusal “resulted in anomalies in the election. Mr. Fox has attempted to assist in the election process that has occurred this year but Mr. Soffer has threatened Mr. Fox and attempted to have him removed from public meetings.”</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Activists have filed suit in an effort to upend a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-recall-election-rules-lawsuit-20170720-story.html">new law that revises the rules for California recall election</a>s.

<p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> The Suffolk Superior Court has ruled that the statewide practice of <a href="http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/07/mass_court_rules_voter_registr.html">setting a 20-day voter registration deadline is unconstitutional</a>, arbitrary and has needlessly prevent thousands of residents from voting. &#8220;The court concludes that the Commonwealth has shown no real reason, grounded in data, facts or expert opinion, why election officials need to close registration almost 3 weeks before the election to do their job,&#8221; Associate Justice Douglas H.

														<p><strong>VI. Tech Thursday</strong></p>
<p><strong>National Tech</strong>: This week, Facebook announced that it will provide funding to <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/343945-facebook-funds-harvard-group-trying-to-fight-election-hacking">Defending Digital Democracy</a>, a Harvard-based nonprofit that seeks to curb cyberattacks aimed at political groups and election systems.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Riverside County District Attorney Michael Hestrin announced that <a href="https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/07/21/hackers-penetrated-voter-registrations-in-2016-through-states-election-site/">hackers successfully infiltrated the state’s online voter registration system in 2016</a> which lead to confusion and heated exchanges between voters, polls workers and poll watchers during the June primary. Twenty formal complaints were filed by voters turned away by poll workers, leaving them unable to vote in their party’s primary. Hestrin told KQED he believes — from anecdotal accounts — that many, many more people were turned away but did not complain, opting instead to forgo voting or to vote by provisional ballot. “I have no idea who they are, or why they did this,” Hestrin said. “Not sure who did it, not sure why, just know it was happening across a broad section.”</p>
<p>Also in California, staff from the Los Angeles County Registrar of Voters office are headed to Defcon, one of the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-defcon-voting-20170724-story.html">world’s largest hacking conventions</a>, to hope they can learn what they need to worry about as they work to create a new voting system for the county. “There is a past history in the election community &#8230; to kind of resist this kind of event,” Registrar of Voters Dean Logan told the Los Angeles Times. “But we need to embrace this. We need to know what the threats are.”</p></p>
