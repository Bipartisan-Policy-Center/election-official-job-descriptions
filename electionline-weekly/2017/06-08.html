							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>A tablet for every county</strong><br /><em>Iowa program provides tablets and accessibility app to all auditors</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />ElectionlineWeekly</p>
<p>It was like Christmas in April when Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate provided all 99 Iowa county elections office with computer tablets.</p>
<p>But these weren’t your average tablet, each of the Acer Tablets included the ADA Checklist for Polling Places Program to help elections officials determine if their voting sites (1,681 statewide) are compliant with the American Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>The checklist provides guidance to election officials to determine whether a polling place has the basic accessibility features needed by voters with disabilities, or can be made accessible on Election Day.</p>
<p>Features of the app include the ability to take photos of polling place structures, and providing guidance for making temporary accommodations. Additionally, it helps counties with polling place layout, reports, and tracking supply needs for individual polling places.</p>
<p>While the state could have just provided the app to each county, an important part of the program was also providing the tablets.</p>
<p>“The tablets are an important part of the package,” said Secretary of State Paul Pate. “They enable auditors to take them to potential polling sites and take pictures with the device. Not every county auditor would already have a device like a tablet to utilize with the app, so it was important to make sure every auditor had one.”</p>
<p>The tablets were paid for with funds from a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Election Assistance to Individuals with Disabilities grant.</p>
<p>The ADA app was originally designed by the IT staff in <a href="https://vote.franklincountyohio.gov/">Franklin County, Ohio board of elections</a> which received a <a href="https://vote.franklincountyohio.gov/assets/pdf/press-releases/2015-08-20.pdf">Professional Practices award</a> from The Election Center in 2015.</p>
<p>“We are quite proud of the work that our team here at the Board of Elections has done to develop and share this software tool that is designed to improve the accessibility of our voting locations to those with physical disabilities,” Ed Leonard, Director of the Board of Elections said in a <a href="https://vote.franklincountyohio.gov/public/documents/pdf/1D128B2B-B8A7-2B54-028A433C2E78111F.pdf">statement</a>.</p>
<p>Franklin County shared the app with Iowa at no cost and officials in Iowa needed to spend only a small amount of money modify the app for use in Iowa.</p>
<p>The Iowa program is part of a Pate&#8217;s larger initiative, &#8220;<a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/news/2017_02_23.html">Helping Veterans and Iowans with Disabilities Vote</a>,&#8221; which is a finalist for the 2017 Ideas Award by the National Association of Secretaries of State.</p>
<p>“The Franklin County Board of Elections was very generous in sharing the app with us and helping us implement it,” Pate said. “We would be glad to pass on this information with other states and counties, but would refer them to the folks in Franklin County who developed it. This ADA Accessibility Checklist App is a wonderful tool.”</p>
<p>Pate said the feedback from auditors has been positive both from the counties and from the disability community.</p>
<p>“These tablets will enable county auditors to confirm that each polling site meets the current ADA Standards. This new technology will be very useful in assuring that all voters are treated uniformly at each polling location in each election,&#8221; said Rhonda Deters, president of the <a href="http://www.iowaauditors.org/">Iowa State Association of County Auditors</a> and <a href="http://www.grundycounty.org/departments/auditor/elections">Grundy County</a> auditor.</p>
<p>Rick Shannon, public policy manager for the <a href="http://iddcouncil.idaction.org/">Iowa Developmental Disabilities Council</a> said in statement that the program is just one more step to make voting accessible not only to those with disabilities, but to all voters.</p>
<p>“The curb cuts and automatic doors that we all take for granted today were intended by the ADA to give individuals with disabilities greater access to the community. Similarly, this renewed focus on polling place accessibility will benefit not only Iowans with disabilities but all voters,” Shannon said.</p>
<p>Another benefit to the program is that the tablets now belong to the county auditors’ offices, so they can also utilize them for other election-related work.</p>
<p>“It’s another step toward modernizing our elections, which is something every county and state in the country should focus on. Making sure all our polling places are accessible to everyone is not just a requirement, it’s a necessity,” Pate said. “I am wholly committed to encouraging and helping all Iowans participate in the electoral process, and this technology is another tool in accomplishing that goal.”</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>&nbsp;II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>A report by a coalition of voting rights groups</strong> called Keystone Vote, charges that as many as 26,000 Pennsylvanians, including 17,000 Philadelphians, were <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/elections-coalition-says-17000-voter-registrations-in-philadelphia-were-processed-late-20170605.html">left off the voter rolls for the 2016 election</a> because their voter registration forms were not processed quickly enough. “We are in business of franchising voters, not disenfranchising voters,” City Commissioner Lisa Deely told the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>. “I am really perplexed. … We need time to verify what they are saying. Where did they get these numbers?” Ray Murphy, a spokesman for Keystone Votes, said the Public Interest Law Center requested from the Department of State all voter-registration transactions from 2016 and noted whether the application was approved or rejected and when.</p>
<p><strong>A report by the Election Integrity Project found</strong> more than <a href="http://www.pe.com/2017/06/07/more-than-4000-incidents-marred-californias-november-election-according-to-a-watchdog-group/">4,300 incidents in 15 California counties that the group believes threaten the integrity of elections</a>. The incidents include things such as failure to ask for voters’ names at check-in, failure to ensure voter privacy and a lack of supplies at polling places. “California has a lot of work to do not only to ensure fair and honest elections, but also to convince the public that there is a reason to participate in the process,” the report concludes. According to the <em>Press-Enterprise</em>, the group describes itself as a “nonpartisan, citizen volunteer organization whose mission is to advocate for fair and honest elections in California.” Orange County Registrar of Voters Neal Kelley told the paper he’s not sure of the project’s methodology or where its data come from. “Unfortunately, not having received or reviewed the report, we cannot comment on any specifics,” said a statement from the LA County registrar’s office. “We have a very rigorous poll monitoring program and work cooperatively with individuals and organizations who observe elections – including providing direct access on Election Day to ensure quick response or corrective action, if needed.”</p>
<p><strong>DuPage County, Illinois Board Chairman Dan Cronin said this week</strong> that he is <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20170605/dupage-county-may-seek-referendum-to-dissolve-election-commission">prepared to seek voter approval to eliminate the county’s election commission</a>. According to the <em>Daily Herald</em>, Cronin was waiting for the state Legislature to merge the current election commission with the county clerk’s office, but the bill got bogged down. Cronin said he&#8217;s prepared to pursue a binding referendum to simply return election oversight to the county clerk&#8217;s office &#8212; power stripped from that office in the early 1970s to create the election commission. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to dissolve the election commission and hand over all of the responsibilities for running elections and administering elections to the county clerk,&#8221; Cronin told the paper.</p>
<p><strong>In the latest round of Reagan vs. the Recorders</strong>, <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2017/06/01/reagan-secretary-of-state-recorders-tensions-mount/354644001/">Arizona’s 15 county elections officials are at odds with Secretary of State Michele Reagan</a> over whose fault it is that a committee that makes sure the state’s voter registration database is working has lapsed. Although the latest spat is over the state’s old voter registration database, officials who spoke with <em>The Republic</em> said it was really about the proposed new voter registration database. &#8220;I think the counties got tired of being pushed around,&#8221; F. Ann Rodriguez, the Pima County recorder told the paper.&nbsp;Most counties have stopped payments to the state for the existing voter registration system in an effort to force the secretary of state’s office to schedule a meeting about the new voter registration database. “This is probably the biggest meeting of the year for us,&#8221; David Stevens, Cochise County recorder told the paper. &#8220;We’re sort of flailing in the wind.”</p>
<p><strong>Voters went to the polls (or mailboxes) in several states</strong> this week including California, Mississippi and New Jersey. Overall turnout was relatively light and the problems were few. In <strong>New Jersey</strong>, <a href="http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/06/after_voting_for_herself_guadagno_vouches_nj_vote_1.html">Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno</a> pulled double duty by voting for herself in the Republican primary for governor and, as the state’s top elections official, assuring the public of the integrity of New Jersey’s voting system in the wake of reports of Russian hacking. Polls in <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/06/who-had-keys-morristown-poll-site-opened-75-minutes-late/374112001/">Morristown</a> opened about 75 minutes late because the head custodian of the polling place location was late. In <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/passaic/wanaque/2017/06/06/wanaque-polling-place-not-relocated-basketball-game/375206001/">Wanaque</a> it was ballots vs. basketballs when there was an attempt to move a polling place — mid-vote — for a basketball fundraiser. The fundraiser moved instead. And hats off to <a href="http://6abc.com/society/96-year-old-new-jersey-poll-worker-inspires/2068704/">Laura Wooten</a> who at 96 served as a poll worker at the same polling site she’s worked for 78 years! In <strong>Mississippi,</strong> a voting location in <a href="http://www.wapt.com/article/jackson-polling-location-runs-out-of-ballots-amid-rush-of-voters/9986619">Jackson</a> ran out of ballots more than an hour before the polls closed. Voters had to wait in line while elections officials resupplied the polling place.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Gov. Rick Scott (R) has signed HB 105 into law. The new law will require county elections supervisors to notify voters if their <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/florida/articles/2017-06-02/florida-gov-signs-33-bills-including-vote-by-mail-fix">signatures on their vote-by-mail ballots</a> and voter registration forms don’t match. The voters would then be given an opportunity to fix the problem before the ballots are counted.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota:</strong> A bill allocating <a href="http://www.southernminn.com/faribault_daily_news/community/article_c3cb39f4-32da-505a-af3e-c4f276b59c5a.html">$7 million for the purchase of new voting equipment</a> has been signed into law. The bill creates a grant fund for counties to replace voting equipment by 2018. It provides up to a 50 percent match between the state and counties for mandatory equipment and up to a 75 percent match for e-poll books.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Assembly Bill 519 would provide $8 million to the secretary of state’s elections division for the purchase of <a href="http://www.nevadaappeal.com/news/government/bill-would-replace-nevada-voting-machines/">new voting equipment</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: The Legislature has approved SB3, a bill that that requires a person registering to vote 30 or fewer days before an election to provide the <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/state-government/Bill-tightening-voter-registration-requirements-passes-in-the-House-06012017">date they established their domicile in the state</a>. Those who lack the proof would still be allowed to vote, but would have mail or present the proof of domicile within 30 days. Gov. Chris Sununu is expected to sign the bill.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Gov. Greg Abbott (R) signed Senate Bill 5 into law. The new law will allow registered voters who lack a <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/abbott-signs-voter-end-straight-party-voting-into-law/5vb95W3p0406a5mRgysEyL/">photo ID</a> to cast a ballot after showing documents that list their name and address, including a voter registration certificate, utility bank, government check or work paycheck.</p>
<p>Also in Texas, the Legislature has approved House Bill 658 that would create a process for <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/06/02/texas-might-broaden-ballot-access-elderly-and-voters-disabilities/">collecting absentee ballots at nursing homes</a> and other such facilities. In essence, the nursing homes would essentially be turned into temporary polling places during early voting to discourage others from attempting to collect the ballots. Under the bill, judges would arrive at a nursing home with enough ballots so that any qualified voter there could fill one out. Folks who may have forgotten to request an absentee ballot could fill out the paperwork on site and cast a vote during the judges’ visit.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> Seattle Councilmember Kshama Sawant is proposing an ordinance that would require landlords to <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/pay-deposit-rent-truck-register-to-vote-kshama-sawant-plan-would-have-landlords-give-voter-info-to-new-renters/">provide voter registration information to all new tenants</a>.</p></p>
