							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Class is in session</strong><br /><em>EAC offers IT workshops for elections officials</em></p>
<p>By M. Mindy Moretti<br />Electionline.org</p>
<p>On a chilly, late November day, 150 elections officials from all over Iowa gathered at the Adventureland Inn in Altoona for a different type of adventure.</p>
<p>Staff from 50 of Iowa’s 99 counties as well as the entire staff from <a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/">Iowa Secretary of State</a> Paul Pate’s office and state IT staff were in attendance to take part in an IT training workshop presented by the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> in partnership with the secretary of state’s office.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with the Election Assistance Commission is crucial, not only for the state, but also for counties,” Pate said in a statement.&nbsp;“It is vital that all of us remain up-to-date on the latest technology and election security issues. We, as election administrators, interface with technology in nearly every aspect of our jobs. Understanding the challenges of our current environment, security considerations and new technology will help us deliver better elections to Iowa voters.”</p>
<p>Modern day election administrators must have core competencies as lawyers, HR specialists, communications officers, accountants, auditors, trainers and information technology managers.</p>
<p>They wear a lot of hats and IT manager is one area where EAC Chairman Matthew Masterson thought his agency could help.</p>
<p>“This sort of evolved out of the state certification meetings,” Masterson explained.</p>
<p>During the state certification meetings, Masterson and the working group realized that some county and even state elections officials didn’t have the baseline attitude, skills and knowledge of being an IT manager.</p>
<p>“The purpose of the workshops is a 101-level class for elections officials,” Masterson said. “This class is designed for folks to bring home the core concepts of being an elections official and an IT manager.”</p>
<p>The workshops are led by Masterson and Director of Testing and Certification Brian Hancock. The EAC covers their own travel expenses and the classes are free to those who participate. In Iowa, the state was responsible for meeting facilities and AV equipment.&nbsp;The total cost was under $1,500.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the classes offer a baseline IT training, Masterson noted that in light of recent events, there has been more of a cybersecurity focus to the workshops.</p>
<p>“In part that’s because that’s what election officials are focused on right now,” Masterson said, “But, in order to take advantage of cybersecurity training, you have to have the baseline attitude, knowledge and skills of an IT manager.”</p>
<p>Masterson said that many of the elections officials also bring their IT staff with them, which really makes the classes interactive.</p>
<p>“It’s a really neat room,” Masterson said. “There is a lot of exchanges between the elections officials and the IT staff. The training works best when there is a really good dialogue. The IT people help to carry the class with us.”</p>
<p>On more than a few occasions, county and state IT staff have been able to answer questions from county elections officials that Masterson and Hancock may not have been able to.</p>
<p>“The feedback we received was very positive from county election administrators,” said Kevin Hall, director of communications for the Iowa secretary of state’s office. “Even though the IT concepts were pretty basic, the IT staff in attendance benefited from hearing security discussed from the election administrators viewpoint, which in turn, will help them serve their county election divisions better.”</p>
<p>To-date Masterson Hancock have conducted a handful of the workshops. Some at the state level and some just at the county level. Masterson said the EAC is open to whatever works for county officials. For example, he noted that <a href="https://escambiavotes.com/about-david-stafford/">Escambia County, Florida</a> Supervisor of Elections David Stafford coordinated a workshop with county officials in the general geographic area of Escambia County.</p>
<p>While Masterson would like to see as many state and local elections officials participate in the workshops as possible, there is no expectation that elections officials in all 50 states and the District of Columbia will participate. Masterson even said the EAC would be fine with if someone wanted to take the slides and glossaries from the workshop and present those local.</p>
<p>“Our pitch is that we offer a training class on IT management which is a new/emerging skill set that election officials have to have to run elections securely and efficiently,” Masterson said. “It’s a starting point. It helps set an attitude.”</p>
<p><em>(Anyone interested in the EAC IT workshops should contact Brian Hancock at <a href="tel:(202)%20459-7861" target="_blank">202-459-7861</a> or via email at <a href="mailto:bhancock@eac.gov" target="_blank">bhancock@eac.gov</a>)</em></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama Special Election:</strong> The eyes of the world turned to Alabama this week for the Senate special election. While the election was not problem-free, there were not widespread problems and polls closed on time. With turnout around 40 percent, long lines did form in some voting locations. In <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2017/12/12/new-voting-machines-cause-senate-election-problem-montgomery-polling-place/944247001/">Montgomery</a>, only one vote tabulation machine was working during the morning hours which added to the lines. There were issues in <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/12/some_mobile_voters_face_delays.html">Mobile</a> when some voters whose addresses on their license did not match that on their voter registration. Voters were referred to a clerk rather than being allowed to vote. A voter’s ID address does not have to match their registration address in order to be able to vote. At one polling place in <a href="http://www.decaturdaily.com/news/elections/judge-party-declaration-improperly-required-in-senate-election-at-fort/article_088384db-42af-525d-b1ff-b54281b2dc85.html">Morgan County</a>, poll workers were improperly requiring voters to declare party affiliation before allowing them to vote. There was also a lot of discussion about a court decision — ultimately going to the state’s Supreme Court—that did not require the state to preserve <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/12/alabama-wont-keep-digital-voting-records-after-special-election/944775001/">digital images of ballots cast</a>. In the days leading up the election, a 2015 news story about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/11/that-viral-story-about-alabama-drivers-license-offices-is-from-2015-and-its-missing-one-key-point/?utm_term=.54f25fb8afa9">voter ID</a> in Alabama began making the rounds with many armchair election geeks expressing concerns about voter suppression. The Washington Post’s Wonkblog does a great deep dive into the story and how old news can affect current situations.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) sent a letter</strong> to National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster asking McMaster to take additional steps to secure elections. According to FCW, in the letter Wyden asked McMaster to designate a senior <a href="https://fcw.com/articles/2017/12/13/wyden-election-cyber-johnson.aspx">White House election security czar</a> to brief Congress of executive branch election security efforts, direct the National Institute for Standards and Technology and the Department of Homeland Security to grade states on their election infrastructure and designate political campaigns as critical infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>In an attempt to boost voter registration and turnout</strong> in Tennessee, U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Nashville) and state Sen. Steve Dickerson (R-Nashville) are teaming proposing <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/12/11/tennessee-voter-registration-cooper-dickerson-project-register/941325001/">Project Register</a>. The project, which is similar to one they started for young voters, would reach adults in workplaces by getting employers to send out reminders to vote in company emails and links to online voter registration and to include voter registration information in the hiring process. As of this week, 75 businesses&nbsp;representing 125,000 employees have signed on to participate in the project. These businesses range from major corporations to local nonprofits to&nbsp;an association of real estate agents&nbsp;and local universities.</p>
<p><strong>We mentioned in a previous edition that there were a lot of tied races</strong> on Election Day 2017 and when we said there were a lot, we weren’t kidding. <a href="http://www.sharonherald.com/news/ties-broken-in-races-from-mercer-county-elections/article_5f9715fc-6354-554c-8256-65e9a016d577.html">Mercer County</a>, Pennsylvania alone had 47 tied races. All of the ties were for municipal auditors and poll workers. All but four of the elections were won by candidates receiving one vote. The ties were broken by the drawing of lots…a lot of lots. <a href="https://observer-reporter.com/news/election/a-tiebreaking-day-at-elections-office-settles-races/article_650cbf8e-e03f-11e7-9c6a-03574b06b80b.html">Washington County</a> also had its fair share of ties, most of which were positions on local boards of elections, but there were also ties in commissioner, auditor and tax collector races.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a major award, times two!</strong> The Seminole County, Florida supervisor of elections has won the <a href="http://awards.electoralnetwork.org/finalists-2017.php">First Time Voter Award</a> from ICPS and the International Electoral Awards Committee. The award recognizes electoral management bodies and electoral officials who have taken outstanding measures to facilitate and optimize the electoral experience for first time voters. Seminole County won for the county’s Future Voter program. Also at the awards, Los Angeles County’s <a href="https://scvnews.com/2017/12/13/la-county-registrar-clerk-wins-international-electoral-award/">Dean Logan</a> was named winner of the 2017 Electoral Ergonomy Award. The category of Electoral Ergonomy recognizes election officials who have tailored electoral procedures to the psychology of the voters and the specific characteristics of their electorate.</p>
<p><strong>And a hearty congratulations</strong> to the Miami Dolphins who were <a href="http://www.hickoryrecord.com/bc-fbn--dolphins-voter-registration/article_061ac7bd-af08-5ec9-a948-d2710f7aa121.html">successfully able register every single player</a> to vote.</p>

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> The DuPage County commission has agreed to put an <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20171212/dupage-voters-to-decide-if-election-commission-should-be-dissolved">advisory referendum</a> question on the March 2018 ballot asking county voters whether or not they would like to see the county election commission disbanded and return the county to having a clerk’s office oversee elections.</p>
<p><strong>Maryland:</strong> Del. Eric Luedkte and Sen. Will Smith plan to introduce the Secure and Accessible Registration Act (SARA) that would <a href="http://www.eyeonannapolis.net/2017/12/voter-registration-changes-sought-in-2018-general-assembly-session/">automatically register</a> Maryland residents to vote whenever they have an interaction with a state agency capable of determining eligibility.</p>
<p>Del. Kirill Reznik plans to introduce legislation that would allow <a href="http://www.eyeonannapolis.net/2017/12/voter-registration-changes-sought-in-2018-general-assembly-session/">election day registration</a>. Currently Marylanders may register and vote during early voting, but may not do so on Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: According to Seacoastonline, expect a <a href="http://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20171210/fight-looming-in-nh-senate-over-voting-rights">voting rights fight</a> when the Senate reconvenes in the New Year. The state Senate Election Law and Internal Affairs Committee approved an amendment to a retained bill, which passed the House of Representatives in the last session, and would tighten the legal definitions of “resident, inhabitant and residence or residency.” The move is expected to pit Senate Democrats who consider the bill an infringement on voting rights against Republicans who claim it eliminates the legal gray area surrounding domiciled citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow <a href="https://www.wpr.org/lawmakers-push-recognition-tribal-id-cards">tribal IDs</a> to be used to verify identity for voter registration.</p></p>

														<p><strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> Steve Curtis, the former chairman of the Colorado GOP has been found guilty of <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2017/12/07/steve-curtis-voter-fraud-conviction/">voter fraud</a> and forgery for signing his ex-wife’s mail ballot. Curtis had claimed he was suffering a diabetic episode and that’s why he signed the ballot. It took a jury about four hours to find him guilty.</p>
<p><strong>Connecticut:</strong> The state Supreme Court will hear arguments next week in an expedited appeal of a lower court’s ruling that found <a href="http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Supreme-Court-to-hear-arguments-in-Bridgeport-12427319.php">fraud and abuse</a> by Bridgeport election officials and ordered a new primary.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Leon County Circuity Judge Charles Dodson ruled that while it’s “unfortunate” that two <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2017/12/08/judge-not-so-fast-on-special-elections-democrats/">special elections</a> occur when they do, moving up the dates could lead to an argument that shorter windows for absentee voting would prevent people from voting. The Democratic Party has sought to move up the elections so the seats would not remain vacant.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey has denied a challenge to how Chicago’s elections board conducts <a href="https://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/511276337-lawsuit-challenging-chicago-election-audit-loses-in-landslide">post-election audits</a>. Several election monitors had filed suit claiming that the audit methods used by the Chicago BOE violated their right to vote as well as their right to association. “Simply put, the plain text of (the law) unambiguously says that the discovery procedure’s results, and thus the 5 percent test’s results, cannot change election results,&#8221; Blakey said in the decision. &#8220;Under Illinois law, the only outcome of an error in the 5 percent test count is a publicly available written report.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: Attorneys for the city of Santa Fe have written an emergency appeal to the state Supreme Court arguing that <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/ranked-choice-voting-unconstitutional-city-argues/article_d40945e4-bd93-5eb6-8852-4dda1897d088.html">ranked choice voting</a> is unconstitutional and the city should not be forced to implement it in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> The Shelby County election commission voted unanimously to file suit against the state election coordinator and the city of Memphis over <a href="https://www.memphisdailynews.com/news/2017/dec/12/election-commission-goes-to-court-in-rcv-controversy/">ranked choice voting</a>. According to the <em>Daily News</em>, the purpose is to get a ruling on whether the use of RCV via a 2008 city charter amendment is valid or if a September opinion from state election coordinator Mark Goins saying there can be no use of RCV is valid. The charter referendum is binding on the election commission and so is the legal opinion from Goins.</p>
<p><strong>Washington:</strong> Snohomish County is planning to sue the state in order to recoup the money it spent on a new law requiring <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/washington/articles/2017-12-11/county-plans-suit-against-state-to-recoup-costs-from-new-law">more ballot drop boxes</a>. According to news reports the county expects to spend $250,000 to install and operate 19 new ballot boxes.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Judge Elliot Levine has declined to punish Connie Sykes, 63 of La Crosse for <a href="http://lacrossetribune.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/judge-declines-punishment-for-ineligible-la-crosse-voter/article_dce2d35c-ae86-5102-b51b-605652423f87.html">voting while ineligible</a>. The judge called the case a “waste of time.” Sykes was still on probation for a 2015 felony conviction when she cast her ballot in the 2016 election. The judge imposed a $518 fine for court costs, which he then vacated.</p>
<p>Also in Wisconsin Judge Martin De Vries accepted a guilty plea from Herbert E. York Jr. for <a href="http://host.madison.com/news/local/courts/horicon-felon-fined-for-voting-illegally/article_ab965168-6448-5f50-a485-0a4fed80cfeb.html">illegally voting</a> in the 2016 election.
