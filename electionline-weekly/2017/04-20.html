														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>Helping judges deal with election cases</strong><br /><em>Five ways elections officials can be resources for judges</em></p>
<p>By David Levine<br />Special to electionlineWeekly</p>
<p>As noted by the <a href="http://law.wm.edu/academics/intellectuallife/researchcenters/electionlaw/">Election Law Program</a>, a joint project of William &amp; Mary Law School and the National Center for State Courts, the United States has witnessed a dramatic increase in election-related litigation over the past ten years.</p>
<p>Legal challenges to election laws and procedures are now commonplace, and a source of considerable uncertainty and confusion.</p>
<p>Election administrators can be an important resource for judges deciding election disputes &#8212; they understand the laws covering voter registration and elections in their jurisdiction(s) and the practicalities of administering and implementing those laws.</p>
<p>Election administrators are often automatically drawn into election disputes. They may, for example, be the named defendant in a lawsuit, in which case they will be the client of (and likely principal witness/resource for) the lawyer handling the case for the jurisdiction. In other cases, the court (or a party to the case) will contact or subpoena an election official to testify as the “local expert” on the subject matter of the case.</p>
<p>But even if an election official is not pulled into a case, there may be ways for him/her to help a judge.</p>
<p>For example, even if not a party, an independently elected official with authority to act on his/her own initiative can reach out and offer to serve as a “friend of the court” when a political dispute becomes a court matter, testifying as an impartial observer and providing facts/insight concerning the relevant law and how it is administered. [An election administrator that is not independent – i.e., one who heads a department that reports to a mayor or county executive – can also do this, but only after securing the approval of his/her superiors.]</p>
<p>Alternatively (and with approval if required), the administrator can reach out to the party he/she believes is correct on the merits, and work with that party to secure its success. For example, if a local or state law enforcement agency files a lawsuit against a candidate for failing to file campaign finance expense reports in a manner that complies with state laws, the election administrator can work with local law enforcement to ensure they understand how reports should be filed.</p>
<p>Here are five ways election administrators can be a resource for judges:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Offer your subject matter expertise on election administration-related matters. In any election-related dispute, a judge must first have a set of facts to work with. For example, where a ballot-related statute has not kept pace with changes in voting technology, a court may be asked to interpret statutory ballot requirements in light of existing capabilities. Election administrators are as well-positioned as anyone to explain changes in voting technology – and their implications for the voting process &#8212; to judges. Without such knowledge, a judge will be hard pressed to interpret statutory requirements in an informed manner.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Tell the judge what it will take to implement a requested remedy. When a plaintiff files a lawsuit alleging that the election official did not follow statutory or administrative requirements when creating the ballot, the plaintiff will often ask the court to correct the ballot mistakes prior to the election. But the court may decline to order corrective action unless it is satisfied that acceptable changes can be made on time and at a reasonable cost. Since election officials are often the ones designing the ballot, and placing candidates and ballot measures on it, they are uniquely well informed about the time and money it will take to fix a mistake, as well as the practical consequences of leaving it unresolved.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Inform the judge of election deadlines that could be impacted by his/her decision. For example, the time required to send and receive absentee ballots may play a role in a pre-election legal challenge, even if absentee ballots themselves are not at issue. The deadline to send absentee ballots can operate as a de facto deadline on court decisions that directly affect the ballot, but judges need to be told about this, and particularly about the actual and/or practical deadline(s) for absentee voters to have their ballots counted.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Be honest with the judge, even when that’s not easy. Election officials must comply with all relevant local, state, and federal laws, but when a lawsuit is brought and there is no way to fully comply, the election administrator should inform the judge immediately. For example, if an emergency fire or flood occurs short before election day and a precinct no longer has an accessible polling place, the election administrator should inform the judge of this immediately, so that efforts to resolve the legal dispute are directed towards a practical, albeit imperfect solution, as oppose to one that cannot be implemented.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> If you can, offer the court options for how to resolve a thorny issue. For example, if there is a natural disaster shortly before election day, the course of the election outcome will be altered no matter what action is taken. Some individuals may want the election to proceed because of all the preparation that has already taken place; others might want to reschedule the election if some/many polling places are unusable and/or election workers are unavailable. There may be no single best remedy, particularly in the absence of controlling statutes or case law. In such circumstances, election officials can call upon their experience to give input to judges on the pros and cons of their available options.</p>
<p>Judges are, by and large, very good at adjudicating legal disputes, but surprisingly few are knowledgeable about how elections are administered.</p>
<p>With no indication that the surge in election litigation will subside anytime soon, it is imperative that judges be become familiar with the how elections are actually conducted, a goal election administrators can and should help them reach.</p>
<p>The Election Law Program has launched a pilot project aiming to help judges understand state election laws. In addition to linking code sections with case law, regulations, advisory opinions, and useful links, the site features annotations by state election experts—including state election administrators&#8211;to provide context for judges. See&nbsp;<a href="http://ebenchbook.wm.edu/">ebenchbook.wm.edu</a>. You can email <a href="mailto:elect@wm.edu">elect@wm.edu</a> if you’re interested in creating an election law “eBenchbook” in your state.</p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske has launched an investigation</strong> in <a href="http://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/17/nevada-secretary-state-alleges-voter-fraud-blames-dmv/305318001/">possible voter fraud on the 2016 general election</a> and she is claiming that the Department of Motor Vehicles may have inadvertently added non-citizens to the voter rolls. Cegavske sent a letter to DMV head Terri Albertson on Friday and on Saturday, Albertson responded in party by saying “Your letter comes as a complete surprise as you and your office have reviewed, contributed to, and approved the processes you are expressing concerns about.” Cegavske said DMV workers being told to accept voter registration information from all customers is a misinterpretation of the law. She ordered the DMV to stop the practice. Albertson responded that her agency will consult attorneys on the matter but that the law requires the DMV to forward the registration information no matter how incomplete it may be, because it is the state’s election officials who ultimately assess voter eligibility. The DMV said its workers do, however, flag cases for further review when eligibility is questioned. Cegavske subsequently announced that the investigation had found <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/evidence-shows-3-non-citizens-voted-in-nevadas-2016-election/">three non-citizens voted</a> in November’s election.</p>
<p><strong>The <a href="http://stthomassource.com/content/2017/04/18/st-thomas-st-john-district-board-cant-certify-special-election-until-rodriquez-de-certified/">ongoing saga around the U.S. Virgin Islands special election continued</a> </strong>this week as members of the St. Thomas-St. John Joint District Board of Elections determined that they may not be able to certify the results until the status of former senator-elect Kevin Rodriquez has been officially settled. “I know it sounds chaotic, it sounds like confusion, but that’s what happens,” District Board of Elections chair Arturo Watlington, Jr. said Tuesday at an emergency meeting on St. Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>Seasonal and temporary elections workers go a long way to easing the workload</strong> of elections offices during high busy times. But sometimes <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/local/williamson-county-outsources-payroll-for-election-workers/JszdpLM5p2BHZdV6EUT2CK/">getting those temporary employees paid becomes more work for already busy elections offices</a>. To solve that problem, Williamson County, Texas has decided to outsource the cost of paying temporary workers to an Austin-based personnel firm. The county will pay about $150,000 for startup costs and then about $33,000 annually. “We’re excited about this contract,” Jeff Evins, vice president of the personnel firm told the Austin-American Statesman. “It’s right up our alley. We have done city, county and state work. We helped out Travis County with the last election. Sometimes people are surprised how many people it takes to make an election happen.”</p>
<p><strong>Although we typically stick to this side of the pond for our elections news</strong>, this week British Prime Minister Theresa May called for a nationwide election on June 8 giving elections officials <a href="http://home.bt.com/news/news-extra/how-on-earth-do-you-organise-an-election-in-51-days-11364174126985">just 51 days</a> to prepare. While parliament will not officially dissolve itself until May 3 officially starting the ball rolling, many elections officials are already hard at work getting ready. We found this article and thought some of you might find it interesting to see how you pull off what is the equivalent of a presidential election in 51 days.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to the <a href="http://naplesherald.com/2017/04/17/collier-elections-office-recognized-communications-skills/">Collier County, Florida supervisor of elections office</a> </strong>which was recently honored with the Grand All Image Award from the Florida Public Relations Association.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation</strong>: Rep. Luke Messer (R-Indiana) has introduced <a href="http://www.wibc.com/news/local-news/federal-voter-id-law-indianas-messer-proposes-it-democrats-object">The Election Integrity Act of 2017</a> (HR 2090) that would require voters to present a valid, government-issued photo ID in order to vote in federal elections beginning in 2020. Messer has modeled his bill after Indiana’s voter ID, which has withstood a Supreme Court challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Gov. Doug Ducey (R) has signed bill that makes it easier to keep <a href="http://www.dailyprogress.com/arizona-gov-ducey-signs-chamber-backed-initiative-proposal/article_bf5659db-d2a4-56d1-98d2-a0d3f9674de2.html">citizen initiatives</a> off the ballot by tightening the legal standard proponents must meet. &#8220;This commonsense legislation preserves the integrity of the process by ensuring that those seeking to make lasting changes to our laws comply with current laws, brings parity to the initiative and referendum processes, and introduces a number of voter education functions to ensure those who engage in the initiative process are educated and equipped to comply with state law,&#8221; he in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> AB 668 will authorize the <a href="http://www.turlockjournal.com/section/14/article/34149/">Voting Modernization Finance Committee</a> to issue and sell bonds in the amount of $450 million for the purpose of assisting counties to purchase new voting equipment and technology necessary for voting centers, which the Assembly approved in 2016 and are scheduled for implementation in 2018.</p>
<p>A bill to move the state’s 2020 <a href="https://lasentinel.net/bill-to-move-up-californias-presidential-primary-clears-first-legislative-committee.html">presidential primary</a> up to March (from June) has cleared its first hurdle by a 5-0 vote in the Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendments.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> The House State, Veterans &amp; Military Affairs Committee has approved HB1281 which would move Colorado to an <a href="http://www.gjsentinel.com/news/articles/legislators-ponder-alternative-method-8232to-elect">approval voting system</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii:</strong> Could The Aloha State be the next to move to all <a href="http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/news/local-news/will-voting-mail-become-standard-hawaii-lawmakers-considering-bill-would-make-it">vote-by-mail</a>? House Bill 1401, which would the state to a vote-by-mail with vote centers system has passed its third read and House conferees are currently “ironing out wrinkles.”</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> By a 28-21 vote, the Senate has given final approval to House File 516, the <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/13/contentious-voter-id-bill-gets-final-ok-heads-branstad/100416752/">Election Integrity Act</a> proposed by Secretary of State Paul Pate. The bill will require voters to show a government-issued ID in order to vote among other provisions. The bill now heads to Gov. Terry Branstad’s desk. He is expected to sign it.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> By a 51-49 vote, the House has approved Senate Bill 352, the <a href="http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2017/04/13/legislature-passes-dozen-bills/100438658/">Montana Ballot Interference Prevention Act</a>. The bill would ask voters if they want to prevent certain people from knowingly collecting someone else’s ballot. The bill will most likely be on the 2018 ballot.</p>
<p>Also in Montana, House Speaker Austin Knudsen has used his parliamentary power to kill a measure that would have allowed county elections officials to conduct the upcoming May 25 <a href="http://www.kxlh.com/story/35182453/mt-house-speaker-kills-mail-ballot-bill-with-parliamentary-power">special election by mail</a>. Knudsen has refused to schedule a floor vote on House Bill 83, which Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock sent back to the House on April 7, with amendments giving counties the option to conduct an all-mail ballot. Without a floor vote, the bill is dead – unless at least 60 House members vote to overrule Knudsen’s decision, which is unlikely. In a statement, Bullock said Knudsen is “playing procedural games to prevent this (bill) from reaching the House floor.”</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: Members of the House Election Law Committee heard several hours of testimony on Senate Bill 3 this week. Under the proposed legislation, there would be new 30-day <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/sb3-hearing-draws-debate-over-student-participation-message-sent-young-voters#stream/0">residency requirements</a> for voters. Town Councilors in <a href="http://www.fosters.com/news/20170417/durham-town-council-passes-resolution-opposing-sb3">Durham</a> have passed a resolution opposing Senate Bill 3.</p>
<p><strong>North Dakota</strong>: By a 35-10 vote, the Senate has approved House Bill 1369 which clarifies which <a href="http://www.westfargopioneer.com/news/government/4252839-nd-lawmakers-pass-voter-id-bill-attorney-says-it-doesnt-meet-federal">forms of ID are acceptable</a> to cast a ballot in the state including a driver’s license or non-driver’s ID. It also includes several options for those living in “special circumstances,” such as in a long-term care facility.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> House Bill 171 would permit a registered voter of the commonwealth to be appointed as a <a href="http://www.observer-reporter.com/20170419/sacconex2019s_poll_watcher_bill_clears_committee">poll watcher</a> in any election district in Pennsylvania. Currently poll watchers can only serve in the jurisdiction where they vote. The bill was recently approved by the House State Government Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong> By a 30-0 voice vote, the Senate has approved a bill <a href="https://www.tnledger.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=96421">legalizing ballot selfies</a>. The bill allows exceptions in which election workers can stop people from using cell phones, mainly relating to harassment, disruptions and a recording of a marked ballot. Photos of marked ballots would be prohibited, for instance, to keep elected officials from requiring employees of taking photos of their vote to prove they backed them at the ballot booth.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> The House Elections Committee has approved a bill that would make court-ordered changes to the states <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas-legislature/2017/04/17/house-committee-approves-bill-make-changes-voter-law">voter ID law</a>. Senate Bill 5 would give more leeway to people who show up at the polls without one of the seven state-approved IDs. They would be allowed to use other documents that carry their name and address, such as a utility bill.</p></p>

							<h2>Legal Updates</h2>
														<p>I<strong>V. Legal Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/breaking-voters-personal-data-risk-cobb-theft/FYDyqME5bqLG4ip4snYLwO/">Four e-poll books were</a> stolen from a Cobb County precinct manager’s car over the weekend, just days before a special election was set to occur. Janine Eveler, Cobb County elections director, told the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> that while the theft would not impact the special election, the devices did contain a copy of the state’s voter file which include voters personal information like birthdate and driver’s license numbers, but not social security numbers. On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.mdjonline.com/news/stolen-voting-equipment-is-safe-in-landfill-officials-say/article_0358631c-253f-11e7-a908-e7be0e64bae2.html">an arrest was made in the case</a>. The e-poll books were not recovered though because they were placed in a dumpster and the dumpster was subsequently dumped at the landfill making it almost impossible to retrieve the devices.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas:</strong> Judge James O’Hara has ordered Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach to <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article145076069.html">disclose documents outlining a strategic plan</a> he presented to then-President-elect Donald Trump in November. The plan, which was in Kobach’s hand when he met with the president-elect made reference to voter rolls, but that portion of the document was obscured by Kobach’s hand. The ACLU sought the documents disclosure as part of their ongoing suit against Kansas’ proof-of-citizenship law. Kobach is <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article145559329.html">seeking a stay</a> in the decision.</p>
<p><strong>Maine:</strong> Last week the state’s highest court heard arguments on the <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/2017/04/13/politics/high-court-hints-action-now-needed-on-maine-ranked-choice-vote-legality/">constitutionality of ranked choice voting</a> in The Pine Tree State. During the hearing, Justice Joseph Jabar told Phyllis Gardiner, an assistant attorney general, that if “we don’t take any action now, there’s definitely going to be a challenge after the next election.” “People aren’t going to know how to vote because they don’t know if it’s going to be a plurality system or a ranked-choice voting system,” Jabar said according to the Bangor Daily News. But James Kilbreth, an attorney for ranked-choice voting supporters, said it wasn’t necessary that the court weigh in before legislators move to implement the law, calling it “a tail-wagging-the-dog kind of problem.”</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> The Green Party of Montana is taking their fight for ballot access in the upcoming May 25 <a href="http://www.ktvh.com/2017/04/mt-green-party-appeals-ballot-access-decision-to-the-us-supreme-court">special election</a> all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The party is appealing a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court that denied an emergency motion requesting a Green Party candidate’s name be added to the ballot.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong>: In 2016, Common Cause sued the New York City Board of Elections over the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/city-group-working-deal-suit-purge-200-000-voters-article-1.3071537">purging of 200,000 voters</a> shortly before the election. State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the Brooklyn U.S. Attorney’s office subsequently joined the suit charging that the city wrongly purged the voters. In papers filed this week, the city indicated that it working towards a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs.</p>
<p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> The state’s highest court has tossed a lawsuit seeking the <a href="http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2017/04/19/pa-supreme-court-tosses-lawsuit-seeking-replacement-of-city-commissioners/">replacement of Philadelphia’s city commissioners</a>. The Committee of Seventy, an elections watchdog group had sued saying that like county officials, the city’s elections officials should recuse themselves from May’s primary. City attorneys argued that Philadelphia commissioners don’t serve in the same capacity as county commissioner and their sole job is to run Philly’s elections. The Supreme Court gave no reason for the dismissal.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Attorney General Ken Paxton has issued an opinion that a court is likely to conclude that <a href="http://setexasrecord.com/stories/511105513-texas-ag-concludes-election-judges-must-take-constitutional-oath">election judges are public officers</a> and must take the constitutional oath of office, in addition to the election officer’s oath. The Texas Secretary of State&#8217;s Election Division had previously opined that election judges are not state officers within the meaning of the constitution and the constitutional oath of office is not applicable to election judges and early voting election officials.</p></p>
