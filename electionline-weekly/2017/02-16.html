							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p>I. In Focus This Week</p>
<p><strong>H.R. 634 puts Election Assistance Commission on the block, again<br /></strong><em>Despite bill, bipartisan support remains for EAC</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>Electionline.org</p>
<p>Like Sisyphus and his rock, Mississippi Congressman <a href="http://harper.house.gov/">Gregg Harper</a> has once again introduced a resolution to dissolve the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a> (EAC).</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/634/text">H.R. 634</a>, the EAC would terminate 60-days after the enactment of the resolution. Some functions of the Commission would transfer to the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC). The bill was introduced on Jan. 24 and approved by a 6-3 party line vote in the House Administration Committee.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cha.house.gov/press-release/harper-time-eliminate-obsolete-election-assistance-commission-presidential-election">statement</a>, Harper says that the existence of the EAC is not necessary to conduct federal elections is a “waste of taxpayer funds.”</p>
<p>Despite Harper’s insistence that the Commission has run its course of usefulness, bipartisan support for the EAC remains.</p>
<p>“In the days leading up to the mark-up and in the days since, we’ve receive notes from election officials and voters across the nation thanking us for our work and validating the important role we play,” said EAC Chairman Thomas Hicks. “We’ve also received widespread, bipartisan support from advocacy groups within the beltway and beyond. Anyone with questions about our value should speak directly with the election officials and voters we serve.”</p>
<p>One of those supporting the continued existence is <a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/">Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams</a> (R). Williams, who has been in office since 2014, says that the EAC in its current incarnation has been extremely helpful to his office.</p>
<p>“The EAC in its present incarnation, and I can’t speak to the old incarnation, they understand their role as an advisory body,” Williams said. “They’ve been very responsive. They reach out to the states. They show up. They listen. And that’s not been my experience with any other federal agencies and so I guess this seems to be the one that is actually working right now and so I would much rather have concentrate efforts on fixing or eliminating agencies that don’t work than those do.”</p>
<p>Williams stressed the work the EAC is doing to certify testing labs and establish standards is incredibly beneficial to secretaries of state as many are navigating new voting systems and a changing electorate.</p>
<p>“The integrity of the election process is not a partisan issue and that’s true whether the secretary of state is a Republican or Democrat,” Williams said. “I believe the EAC is trying to ensure the election process works well.”</p>
<p>Williams said he does not support folding portions of the current EAC into the FEC because the FEC is too political.</p>
<p>“I do not favor nationalizing elections. And in fact, I strongly oppose that, but I don’t see the EAC as doing that because of the nature of their task and role,” Williams said. “I am less confident in other bodies. The FEC for example has not shown itself historically to be a body that works together for the benefit of elections processes. Has tended to be a body that has a very partisan bent that’d why transferring all the functions to the FEC makes no sense.”</p>
<p>But not all of Williams’ counterparts are as enthusiastic. By a 16-12 vote, in 2015, the <a href="http://www.nass.org/">National Association of Secretaries of State</a> reaffirmed an earlier position on eliminating the EAC. NASS is currently holding its winter conference in Washington, D.C. and while the status of the EAC is not on the agenda, Leslie Reynolds with NASS said that it could come up, although nothing is planned.</p>
<p>However, the tide may be turning. In 2015, Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler (R) who was then president of NASS was one of the Yes votes to support eliminating the EAC. Now, he is now on the record saying that he would support the EAC remaining.</p>
<p>“I kind of like what I see now,&#8221; Schedler <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/11/schedler-now-wants-keep-election-assistance-commission/81591750/">told</a> USAToday. “And I’m willing to take a look-see attitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>Electionline reached out to several organizations-NIST, FVAP, etc. who would be impacted by the dissolution of the EAC, but they were unable to comment on pending legislation.</p>
<p>And while the debate continues on Capitol Hill and in the states about whether or not the EAC remains relevant, the Commission is continuing to do the work it was tasked to do.</p>
<p>“The stakes are high for all election officials right now. They face incredible and unique pressures, and we know that the EAC’s support is needed now more than ever before,” Hicks said. “Each day we work to better serve election officials and voters. There’s no time for complacency or ‘business as usual.’ Election administrators need support and resources more now than ever, and the EAC is here to assist them.”</p>
<p>The EAC is currently working to prepare for next year’s midterm elections and that effort will be largely informed by the 2016 <a href="http://archives.eac.gov/program-areas/research/doc/final-election-administration-and-voting-survey-guide-05112010/attachment_download/file">Election Administration and Voting Survey</a> (EAVS) which is slated for release at the end of June. This spring the EAC will debut a new website that will feature a cutting-edge, user-friendly design. The site will also become the new permanent home for the popular tools and guidance stemming from the <a href="http://bipartisanpolicy.org/the-presidential-commission-on-election-administration/">Presidential Commission on Election Administration</a> (PCEA).</p>
<p>For his part, Williams said that he plans to speak with the Colorado congressional delegation when he’s in D.C. this week and hopes that his colleagues will consider doing their part to encourage the continuation of the EAC.</p>
<p>“I think it is important to look at reality vs. rhetoric,” Williams said. “And in this case the reality is that the EAC, with its present commission has been doing a good job in providing assistance and support. They have recognized the importance of their middle name.”</p>

							<h2>Our Say</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Our Say</strong></p>
<p><strong>We Still Need the EAC</strong></p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.hhh.umn.edu/directory/doug-chapin">Doug Chapin</a>,<br />University of Minnesota</p>
<p>Last week, the Committee on House Administration (CHA) voted 6-3 on partisan lines to approve <a href="https://cha.house.gov/hearing/priorities-house-officers-and-legislative-branch-entities-fy-2018-and-beyond-panel-two">convene</a>&nbsp;to markup&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr634/BILLS-115hr634ih.pdf">H.R. 634</a>, the “Election Assistance Commission Termination Act.” The bill is part of CHA Chairman Gregg Harper (MS-3)’s ongoing&nbsp;attempt to eliminate the EAC, a campaign&nbsp;he has waged for several Congresses (and about which I wrote most recently in&nbsp;<a href="http://editions.lib.umn.edu/electionacademy/2015/03/02/even-after-return-congressiona/">March 2015</a>).</p>
<p>The bill itself is pretty simple: it dissolves the EAC,&nbsp;returns its NVRA (“motor voter”) regulatory authority to the Federal Election Commission (whence it came thanks to the Help America Vote Act of 2002) and directs the federal government to wind up the EAC’s affairs. The bill is silent on other key facets of the EAC’s work, like certification and testing of voting technology and data collection via the Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS). It’s hard to believe such work would simply stop, but the bill says nothing about what would happen post-termination.</p>
<p>Previous versions of the bill have made it out of committee but haven’t gotten floor consideration – and none have been introduced or considered in the Senate. Still, with the change in Administrations and scrutiny of the nation’s election system remaining high, there is concern in the election community that&nbsp;the&nbsp;EAC – which came back two years ago from a lengthy limbo and has been at a sprint ever since to restore programs&nbsp;and partner with election officials – could be&nbsp;in danger this time.</p>
<p>The timing of the bill is especially odd this year, given that the EAC is at the heart of discussions between state and local election officials about the reach and impact of the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to designate elections as “critical infrastructure” in response to concerns about cybersecurity. This week, the EAC is co-hosting the meeting of the Technical Guidelines Development Committee, which is tasked with updating federal voting technology standards. Later this year, the EAC will release the data from the 2016 EAVS, which supports evidence-based management nationwide AND is crucial to the work of agencies like the Defense Department’s Federal Voting Assistance Program to ensure voting access by our overseas and military voters worldwide.</p>
<p>2016 taught me that predictions are difficult (and/or I’m just no good at them) but I am still skeptical that this bill goes anywhere in the current Congress. The security and integrity of American elections is a topic of great interest right now, whether you believe there is voter fraud (or insist there’s no evidence of it) or have concerns about external threats, foreign or domestic, to the technology that supports our voting system. In that environment, I find it hard to believe that there is a majority on Capitol Hill to eliminate the one federal agency (and its comparatively small budget) that is focused on helping election officials cope with these issues.</p>
<p>The title of this post is pretty clear, but I’ll repeat it here:&nbsp;we still need the EAC, maybe more than ever.&nbsp;At a time when so many questions are being asked about the country’s election system, it simply doesn’t make sense to do away with the one agency (and its people) central to helping states and localities get the answers.</p>

														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>A bipartisan group of residents in Dallas County, Iowa</strong> <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/2017/02/13/dallas-county-conduct-review-missed-absentee-votes/97853910/">will meet to review thousands of absentee ballots</a> that the county failed to count on Election Day. While none of the 5,842 absentee ballots would have changed the outcome of a race, newly elected Auditor Julia Helm has called for a special review of the results. According to the <em>Des Moines Register</em>, a separate not-yet-formed committee will review the county’s election procedures before the May 2 special election. &#8220;All of the stuff we sent to the secretary of state,&nbsp;we just thought people in our community should review the same thing,&#8221; Helm said. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to be transparent.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Massachusetts’ state auditor has determined that early voting</strong>—which debuted in 2016 and proved to be wildly successful — <a href="http://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/mass-auditor-says-state-should-pay-cities-and-towns-for/article_c62fffcb-39a7-54ec-80fb-d7805704501f.html">constituted a state mandated on cities and towns and that the state should pay for it</a>. According to <em>The Sun Chronicle</em>, Auditor Susan Bump said about one million voters, or 22 percent of the total, cast ballots during the 12 days leading up to the November election, and staying open those extra days cost cities and towns about $1.1 million. &#8220;The early voting law certainly is to be regarded a success. It did, however, mandate new procedures for clerks. Some of these should be paid for by the state, not municipalities, according to the Local Mandate Law,&#8221; she told the paper.</p>
<p><strong>West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner recognized</strong> a group of high school juniors and seniors <a href="http://www.register-herald.com/news/students-honored-for-voter-registration-work/article_72c43c6a-a86b-527d-a559-fb844f29edfb.html">who registered more than 1,500 new youth voters</a> in The Mountain State.

														<p><strong>IV. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation:</strong> Congresswoman Susan Davis (D-San Diego) has <a href="http://lgbtweekly.com/2017/02/11/rep-susan-davis-re-introduces-legislation-to-expand-access-to-voting-and-to-protect-the-integrity-of-elections/">re-introduced two election reform bills</a>. The Universal Right to Vote by Mail Act would end restrictions some states impose on voting absentee. The Federal Election Integrity Act would prohibit the chief election official of a state from serving on a federal campaign committees or engaging in other political activity on behalf of federal candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado:</strong> Senate Democrats attempted to amend a <a href="https://www.coloradostatesman.com/colorado-campus-free-speech-bill-hits-bump-in-senate-over-voter-registration-activity/">campus free speech bill</a> to include voter registration activity among the kids of “speech” the bill marks out in particular for protection. All 18 Senate Republicans voted down the amendment.</p>
<p><strong>Florida:</strong> Sen. Aaron Bean (R) has proposed legislation that would make the <a href="http://news.wfsu.org/post/florida-secretary-state-could-become-elected-office">secretary of state position</a> an elected position. Currently the secretary of state is appointed by the governor. If approved, the first secretary of state election would be in 2020.</p>
<p>Also in Florida, Sen. Dennis Baxley (R-Ocala) and Rep. Don Hahnfeldt (R-Villages) have introduced legislation that would allow <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/what-could-go-wrong-lawmakers-consider-guns-at-bars-polling-places-games/2313274">concealed carry in polling places</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho:</strong> Rep. Don Cheatham (R-Post Falls) has introduced legislation that would allow conceal carry permits to serve as an <a href="http://www.kivitv.com/news/bill-to-allow-concealed-carry-permit-as-voter-id-introduced">acceptable form of ID</a> in order to vote. The legislation has been <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/House-rejects-bill-to-ban-guns-at-polling-places">approved</a> by the House State Affairs Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> House Bill 2472 seeks to <a href="http://www.nwherald.com/2017/02/10/mchenry-county-lawmakers-make-push-to-abolish-local-election-boards/aec66us/">abolish electoral boards</a> for municipalities, townships and community colleges and transfer the duty of hearing ballot objections to county electoral boards. Rep. Barbara Wheeler (R-Crystal Lake) said the legislation was introduced because in many cases the lack of knowledge of election law or outright political reasons translate to unfair treatment of objections to candidacies for local races.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> Secretary of State Paul Pate is proposing legislation that would require political organizations to <a href="http://tdn.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/iowa-bill-outlaws-voter-form-delays-in-rebuke-of-democrats/article_d29abff7-35c0-5e43-bb82-169f6999301f.html">promptly turn in voter registration forms</a> they collect. Under Pate’s plan, prosecutors would be authorized to file charges against parties, campaigns and other that wait longer than seven days to submit completed voter registration forms.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> Rep. Derek Skees (R-Kalispell) has introduced HB-357 that would require voters to show <a href="http://mtpr.org/post/opponents-montana-voter-id-bill-say-it-would-limit-access">photo ID in order to vote</a>. When speaking on behalf of the bill at a House committee, Skees cited voter fraud—although none has been found in Montana—as a need for the bill.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> Assemblywoman Lisa Krasner (R-Reno) has introduced House Bill 164 that would mandate voters <a href="http://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/13/assemblywoman-introduces-voter-id-bill/97864562/">show an ID</a> when casting a ballot. The bill contains a provision for free IDs provided by the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p>Also in Nevada, SB 103 has been introduced and referred to the Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections. Under the proposed bill, Nevada would move to a <a href="http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB103.pdf">modified blanket primary election system for partisan offices</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: By a 204-144 vote, the House has defeated a bill that would have <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/House-rejects-bill-to-ban-guns-at-polling-places">banned firearms from polling places</a>.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: A House committee has approved House Bill 206 which would <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/949947/open-primaries-bill-clears-first-house-committee.html">open New Mexico’s primaries</a> to independent voters. The bill was introduced by a bipartisan team of legislators and is supported by Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver. It now moves to the House Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Rep. Kathleen Clyde (D-Kent) has introduced legislation that would <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/02/automatic_voter_registration.html">automatically register people to vote</a> if they&#8217;ve received veterans&#8217; or disability services or public assistance through the Department of Job and Family Services and when they get a driver&#8217;s license or state ID card. Public and private school students would be registered when they turn 18.</p>
<p>The Toledo City Council is considering a charter proposal that would <a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2017/02/13/Lucas-County-primary-elections-could-shift-to-May.html">shift the municipal primary</a> from September to May like 85 other Ohio counties.</p>
<p><strong>Oregon:</strong> Initiative Petition 5 has been approved for signature gathering would require every voter in the state to provide <a href="http://www.wweek.com/news/2017/02/15/a-new-ballot-initiative-would-require-oregon-voters-to-prove-their-citizenship-before-voting/">proof-of-citizenship</a> within two years—by 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> By a 73-0 vote the House approved HB105 that would <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/4927553-155/bill-to-extend-early-voting-advances">extend early in-person voting</a> until Election Day. Currently early voting ends the Friday before an election. If approved voting would be available through the Monday before an election.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> A Senate subcommittee voted to <a href="http://www.dailypress.com/news/politics/dp-nws-veris-budget-20170209-story.html">cut $4 million</a> in new funding from the Virginia Department of Elections.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Sen. Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) has introduced a bill that would limit a candidate’s ability to <a href="http://www.wkow.com/story/34515622/bill-would-prevent-candidates-like-jill-stein-from-requesting-recounts-in-future-state-elections">request a recount</a>. Only candidates who finish within one percent of the winner would be able to request a recount. The requesting candidate would still have to pay for the recount.</p></p>

<p><strong>National Tech</strong>: After more than a year of investigation and collaboration Voatz, Inc. and Clear Ballot Group, Inc. are announcing their partnership to accelerate the introduction of secure, accessible remote voting in elections. Voatz brings an open source blockchain platform designed for secure, high volume remote voting on smartphones and tablets. It has been independently evaluated for security and has already been piloted successfully in several private and municipal elections in 2016.&nbsp; Clear Ballot, a voting system company, has provided the Voatz team with election industry knowledge, market requirements and a rich sample election dataset that allows their engineers to understand and build support for the complexities and scale of real elections.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho:</strong> Secretary of State Lawerence Denney says that he expects the state to be ready for <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/boise/2017/feb/10/denney-said-idaho-should-have-online-voter-registration-next-fall/">online voter registration</a> by the fall. “I doubt that we’ll get it up by the May election, but we would like to have it by August and November, and for the March election next year,” Denney told the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, “so that we have some time to iron out any bugs that we might find before the 2018 primary election.”</p>
<p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Hart InterCivic announced this week that the Verity Voting system is not only the only all-new system approved by the State of Michigan, but that the <a href="http://www.hartintercivic.com/Michigan">system is 100 percent covered</a> under the state’s voting system replacement fund. Counties that select Verity will receive full funding for the state-of-the-art system as well as coverage for five years of Hart’s industry-leading maintenance and support program.</p>

<p><strong>Texas:</strong> While some counties are still using voting equipment purchased shortly after HAVA was enacted in 2002, Wichita County is considering <a href="http://www.timesrecordnews.com/story/news/local/texas/2017/02/10/county-considers-voting-equipment-upgrade/97748430/">upgrading voting equipment</a> it purchased in 2014.
