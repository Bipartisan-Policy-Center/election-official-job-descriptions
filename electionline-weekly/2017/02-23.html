							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secretaries of state gather for winter meeting<br /></strong><em>2016 still a major topic of conversation in 2017</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:david.alan.levine@gmail.com">David Levine<br /></a>Special to electionlineWeekly</p>
<p>On Friday, February 17, 2017 the <a href="http://www.nass.org/">National Association of Secretaries of State</a> had its first conference since the November 2016 general election, and attendees were excited to analyze the election and prepare for future ones.</p>
<p><strong>Promoting Voter Trust and Confidence in Elections<br /></strong>At a morning general session, “Promoting Voter Trust and Confidence and Elections,” panelists discussed voters’ lack of confidence in elections and electoral systems, despite the generally successful administration of the 2016 general elections.</p>
<p>Large groups of voters have a perception of how the election was administered that did not match reality. For instance, on the day after the election, 33 percent of Republicans and 44 percent of Democrats reported that they thought it was possible for someone to alter how a vote was cast, according to research conducted by Porter Novelli.</p>
<p>“It’s just this lack of awareness of how the process actually works that starts to call into question the integrity of the ballot,” said Rebecca Mark, vice president of Porter Novelli.</p>
<p>David Becker, co-founder and executive director of the <a href="https://www.electioninnovation.org/">Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research</a>, noted that many unsubstantiated challenges to the integrity of the election system – such as allegations of rigging, hacking and widespread fraud – were undoubtedly being seen or heard by these voters.</p>
<p>“As big of a bully pulpit as one side had…there were challenges to the integrity of the system coming from a variety of different place on the [political] spectrum, and this started well before the election,” he said.</p>
<p>But allegations of rigging, hacking, and fraud did not move all communities. Rosalind Gold, senior director of policy, Research and Advocacy for the <a href="http://www.naleo.org/">National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) Education Fund</a>, acknowledged the importance of ballot and voting equipment integrity to voter confidence, but noted these issues “are not as salient to the Latino community as sound election administration practices” and belief in their votes.</p>
<p>A substantial number of Latino voters reported trouble casting their ballot due to problems with the administration of the 2016 general election &#8212; such as long lines, malfunctioning voting machines and inadequate language assistance &#8212; and a large number of eligible Latino voters did not vote because they didn’t feel their vote would make a difference, she said.</p>
<p>Other factors also likely contributed to low voter confidence, said Miles Rapoport, senior practice fellow at the <a href="http://ash.harvard.edu/">Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation</a>, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Democracy-related activities not being a regular part of most people’s lives;</li>
<li>Unnecessary barriers to voting that could be removed by enacting policies such as early voting and same day registration; and</li>
<li>Other democracy-related issues that reduced a voter’s political clout, such as partisan gerrymandering and the influence of money in politics.</li>
</ol>
<p>Going forward, panel members suggested multiple ways to improve voter confidence for the 2018 Elections.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/">Wayne Williams, the Colorado Secretary of State</a>, urged election officials to continue to work with other stakeholders to seek their advice, share election information, and make improvements to ensure that voters are confident in the election process.</p>
<p>Becker encouraged election officials to adopt measures that help improve the administration of the elections, such as adopting online voter registration or enacting robust and transparent audits, and remind stakeholders of the “checks and balances” used to ensure that the election is being administered properly.</p>
<p>Samidh Chakrabarti, product manager for Civic Engagement at Facebook, stated that the social networking company will continue to search for places on its platform to provide election information to people who want it, but aren’t willing to proactively seek it out, to ensure that more individuals participate in the election process and have access to accurate election information.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity and the 2016 Election</strong><br />At the general session, “Cybersecurity and the 2016 Election,” a talk originally billed as a discussion of cybersecurity in the 2016 General Election, quickly pivoted to the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS), and its role in future elections.</p>
<p>Following the breaches of voter registration data in Arizona and Illinois last year, DHS began offering cybersecurity assistance to many states, at their request, in the run up to the 2016 general election.</p>
<p>In January of 2017, shortly before leaving office, then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson decided to designate election infrastructure as critical infrastructure, a designation current Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has indicated he plans to continue. According to then-DHS Secretary Johnson, the designation will enable the country’s election infrastructure —which includes storage facilities, polling places and centralized vote tabulations locations, as well as technology used to manage the election process and report the results — to be a priority for DHS cybersecurity assistance if state and local election officials ask for it.</p>
<p>At the session’s outset, <a href="http://www.ct.gov/sots/site/default.asp">Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill</a> expressed her and many of her colleagues’ concerns with DHS’s designation.</p>
<p>“It’s a broad new role for the federal government….we have concerns about where it could go,” Merrill said, adding that she wants to know in writing what DHS will do as a result of the designation, and that she has been waiting on a response since January.</p>
<p>Neil Jenkins, chief of policy and planning for the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/office-policy">U.S. Department of Homeland Policy</a>, acknowledged these criticisms, noting that “It’s not the first time we’ve [DHS] had this issue” with critical infrastructure providers.</p>
<p>However, he defended the designation, underscoring the urgency and time constraints associated with elections.</p>
<p>Noting that “the last thing we want to do for 2018 is to dive back in during and August and September,” Jenkins said that the designation would enable DHS to begin working immediately with election officials to secure certain technologies and processes for future elections.</p>
<p>Merrill indicated that NASS is creating a task force to collaborate with federal agencies and other stakeholders on election cybersecurity matters.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On February 18, 2017, the National Association of Secretaries of States formally voted to: 1) <a href="images/NASS_DHS_Resolution.pdf" class="wf_file"><span class="wf_file_text">oppose the federal critical infrastructure designation covering election systems</span></a>; and 2) establish a cybersecurity taskforce to develop and advance priorities and plans on election cybersecurity.</p>

<p><strong>It’s better to do the dumping than get dumped?</strong> In an effort to save money, the City of Meridian, Mississippi is considering working directly with a vendor — ES&amp;S — to <a href="http://www.meridianstar.com/news/local_news/city-of-meridian-wants-to-handle-elections-in-house/article_b5ad1c87-9ad3-5cf0-afcb-75d9c369564f.html">manage the May 2 municipal election instead of using the services of the Lauderdale County</a> election commission. The city will pay ESS $50,927 to oversee the municipal election. For the 2013 municipal election, the city paid the Lauderdale County Election Commission $24,414, which did not include rental fees for county voting machines. However, before the city could officially decide, the county election commission voted 3-2 to <a href="http://www.wtok.com/content/news/Election-commission-withdraws-offer-of-help-414412803.html">rescind their offer to help</a> with the city’s elections. According to WTOK the election commission made the decision after “much slander, misinformation, accusations and attempts to discredit the Lauderdale County Election Commission by city officials.”</p>
<p><strong>The Oregon Elections Division has </strong><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/02/dennis_richardson_2_apparent_i.html"><strong>reviewed</strong> addresses receiving more than 10 ballots</a> and that that only two appear to be “fraudulent.” Most of the addresses receiving more than 10 balltos are retirement homes or fraternity or sorority houses. Secretary of State Dennis Richardson told The Oregonian that it was reassuring to find only two, out of more than 6,500 addresses that are questionable. “I said, &#8216;Really? Only two?&#8217; I was pleasantly surprised at that,&#8221; Richardson told the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Freshman Missouri Rep. Cheri Toalson-Reisch</strong> (R-Hallsville) has announced that she will personally help her constituents in Boone County that <a href="http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/local/state-rep-offers-help-with-voter-id/article_140b1d85-4f8e-580e-bede-0df0868b9628.html">cannot obtain the necessary documents to get a voter ID</a>. She supported the voter ID measure and disputes that there are disenfranchised voters so she has offered to drive anyone who needs help in getting documentation to the county courthouse and has even offered to pay for that documentation for the first person that comes forward. &#8220;I would like to know where these disenfranchised voters are. I’ve never met one, I’ve not seen one, and so I want to help these disenfranchised voters,” Toalson-Reisch told the Columbia Daily Tribune. “I don’t want them to be disenfranchised. I want them to be inclusive and to be a part of the process, not excluded at all.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Personnel News:</strong> <a href="http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/section/6/article/121947/"><strong>Tommy Sandoval</strong> </a>has resigned from the Hall County, Georgia board of elections. <strong><a href="http://www.wral.com/former-elections-board-chief-among-cooper-judge-appointments/16536103/">Larry Leake</a></strong>, former North Carolina Board of Elections member has been appointed to serve as a District Judge by Gov.

							<h2>Legislative Updates</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Legislative Updates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Federal Legislation:</strong> New York Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-Monroe County) has introduced legislation that would <a href="http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/272357/tonko-backs-bill-to-move-election-day-to-the-weekend/">move Election Day from the first Tuesday</a> in November to the first Saturday and Sunday after the first Friday in November. The legislation would change the dates of federal elections every even year, which would include the presidential election every four years.</p>
<p><strong>Alaska:</strong> House Bill 7, which would allow voters to take and post <a href="http://www.kfsk.org/2017/02/22/ballot-selfies-bill-moves-in-the-alaska-house/">ballot selfies</a> has moved out of the Community and Regional Affairs Committee and now moves to the House Rules Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas:</strong> An amendment to a voter ID bill in the House would allow someone who doesn’t show ID to <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/arkansas/articles/2017-02-17/arkansas-lawmaker-adds-affidavit-option-to-voter-id-bill">sign a sworn statement</a> under penalty of perjury at the polling site. The ballot would be counted unless the county board of election commissioners finds it invalid based on other grounds. &#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to put in is something that improves confidence in the integrity of the ballot without unduly disenfranchising voters who for whatever reason don&#8217;t have ID,&#8221; Rep. Mark Lowery told the <em>Associated Press</em>. &#8220;I think it serves as a needful deterrent for anyone who would want to commit election fraud.&#8221; The House State Agencies committee has <a href="http://www.arkansasmatters.com/news/local-news/house-committee-selects-voter-id-measure-as-proposed-constitutional-amendment/661342099">approved</a> the bill which now moves to the full House.</p>
<p><strong>California:</strong> Assembly Bill 674, from Evan Low (D-Cupertino) would make November elections on years a <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/02/16/california-bill-would-make-election-day-a-state-holiday/">holiday for schools and state workers</a> as a way to boost voter turnout.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho:</strong> A bill introduced by Rep. Dustin Manwaring (R-Pocatello) and headed to the full House for a vote would limit <a href="http://kboi2.com/news/local/bill-limiting-early-voting-in-idaho-headed-to-house-floor">early voting</a> in Idaho to any time from three weeks prior to an election to one week before. Currently county clerks have the choice begin early voting on or before the third week from the election.</p>
<p><strong>Illinois:</strong> Sen. Daniel Biss (D-Evanston) has introduced a bill that would amend state election code to have <a href="https://dailynorthwestern.com/2017/02/16/city/biss-introduces-ranked-choice-voting-bill/">ranked-choice voting</a> in elections for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller, secretary of state, treasurer and General Assembly member.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana:</strong> The House Elections and Apportionment Committee has approved House Bill 1178 which would <a href="http://www.tribstar.com/news/local_news/bmv-staff-would-ask-register-patrons-to-vote-under-amended/article_262840c8-f453-11e6-b3e1-93bbdefac674.html">allow residents to register to vote</a> when they obtain or renew their driver’s license, permit or identification card at the BMV. The amended bill requires BMV employees to ask residents if they want to be registered to vote.</p>
<p><strong>Montana:</strong> Rep. Derek Skees (R-Kalispell) has asked the House State Administration to committee his bill that would have required voters to <a href="http://mtpr.org/post/montana-lawmaker-puts-brakes-his-own-voter-id-bill">show a photo ID</a> in order to vote.</p>
<p>Under Senate Bill 305, county elections officials would be permitted to hold the special election to replace U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke with an <a href="http://www.ktvh.com/2017/02/county-officials-ask-lawmakers-to-allow-all-mail-ballots-in-special-election">all vote-by-mail election</a> if they choose to. They could still hold an election using traditional polling places. Many county elections officials are in favor of the bill because it would save them thousands of dollars. However the head of the Montana GOP has said he is opposed to the bill because it would give Democrats an <a href="http://billingsgazette.com/news/gop-chairman-says-mail-elections-hurt-republicans-is-accused-of/article_22d791f1-e3dd-5b4b-b8f2-c9fcbb137888.html">inherent advantage</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Nevada:</strong> The Assembly voted 27-15 to approve legislation that would <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2017/feb/22/motor-voter-program-clears-first-hurdle/">automatically register</a> residents to vote when they obtain a new or renew a driver’s license. The bill must still be approved by the Senate. If approved it will become law on Jan. 1, 2018. If the Senate does not approve the bill, it will go before the voters in November 2018.</p>
<p><strong>New Hampshire</strong>: A bill has been introduced that would <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/lawmaker-proposes-closing-nhs-primaries-cites-potential-electoral-sabotage#stream/0">ban undeclared voters</a> from participating in primary elections unless they change their registration before election day.</p>
<p><strong>New Mexico</strong>: SB 224, which has been approved by a Senate committee, would change current law to allow residents to register at any early voting center or a county clerk’s office until <a href="http://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2017/02/17/senate-advances-sen-steinborns-bill-expand-voter-registration-time-period/98075870/">three days before an election</a>.&nbsp;The bill would increase the length of time during which voters may register by 25 days, while putting in place safeguards to maintain the security of the state’s voter registration system.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio:</strong> Rep. Dorothy Pelanda (R-Marysville) has introduced House Bill 41 that would allow boards of elections to require voters to <a href="http://www.journal-news.com/news/local/state-lawmaker-proposes-changes-early-voting-process/u9QDGtM9kDPw70zxK1V2IJ/">show a photo ID in order to vote</a>. The bill would also push back challenging a person’s voting eligibility to 30 days before an election.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> Senate Bill 5 would add options for Texans who say they cannot “reasonably” obtain of the seven <a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article134170294.html">forms of ID</a> currently required in order to vote. It would also add hard criminal penalties if anyone falsifies their reason for needing to use one of the expanded forms of ID.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Virgin Islands</strong>: The Senate has voted to approve a measure aimed at correcting discrepancies in existing law regarding the <a href="http://viconsortium.com/politics/in-rowdy-senate-session-senators-keep-unified-elections-board-law-fund-where-funds-are-available-special-election/">unified elections board</a>. Corrections include directing the St. Thomas-St. John Board of Elections to conduct the April 8 election; putting off the unification of both district boards into one board until July 31.</p>
<p><strong>Utah:</strong> HB 285, which would have required all counties to provide <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865673598/Statewide-Election-Day-registration-bill-halted-in-House-committee.html">same-day voter registration</a> has stalled in the House Government Operations Committee. The bill would have enacted a five-year pilot program to extend the test program currently ongoing in eight counties.</p>
<p>The House Government Operations Committee is holding a bill that seeks to <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865674022/Bill-protecting-voter-registration-information-held-by-committee.html">limit access to voter registration records</a>. Rep. Becky Edwards (R-North Salt Lake) has agreed to continue eto work on the bill.</p>
<p>The House Government Operations Committee voted 8-1 to forward a <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865674026/Lawmakers-consider-letting-voters-rank-choices-for-candidates.html">ranked-choice voting</a> bill to the full House.</p>
<p><strong>Virginia:</strong> A bill intended to <a href="http://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/peake-s-provisional-ballot-bill-dead-in-house-subcommittee/article_0ceb83ea-f4a3-11e6-9854-df0587549890.html">shorten the gap between</a> when legislators win special elections and when they take their seats failed to pass a House Privileges and Elections subcommittee. While the bill passed the Senate 23-17 it failed unanimously in the House subcommittee. The bill would have required registrars to certify special elections before every provisional ballot was counted unless the total number of outstanding provisional ballots could&nbsp;change who wins. The provisional ballots still would be counted.</p>
<p>A proposed constitutional amendment overhauling the way Virginia <a href="http://www.dailypress.com/news/politics/dp-nws-shad-plank-0218-20170217-story.html">restores voting rights to felons</a> died in a House committee. Senate Joint Resolution 223 would have made restorations automatic after sentences and probations are complete, and any other conditions set by the legislature are met. For violent felons the governor could only restore civil rights five years after any probation or suspended sentence run their course.</p>
<p>The Senate has a passed a bill by a 21-19 vote that would allow localities the option to <a href="http://www.henricocitizen.com/news/article/senate_passes_voter_photo_id_measure_in_close_vote_0481#.WK8JdRCSXBJ">include photographs of registered voters in their e-poll books</a>. Local elections officials would be able to access voter photos through the DMV. The bill would allow elections officials to challenge the voter if they don’t look like their photo.</p>
<p><strong>Wyoming:</strong> A proposal that would have limited <a href="http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/party-switching-on-wyoming-primary-day-lives-on-bill-dies/article_6c8a1494-757f-5394-91ed-965034c53475.html">party-switching</a> to 30-days prior to an election was defeated in the Senate Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivision Committee by a 3-0 vote.</p>

<p><strong>Arizona:</strong> Alan Faygenblat, 38 of Scottsdale, has been sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation and 160 hours of community restitution for <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/954506/maricopa-county-man-sentenced-for-false-voter-registration.html">filing false voter registration</a>. Faygenblat argued that he was trying to prove a point that Maricopa County’s voter registration process is flawed.</p>
<p><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Governor Roy Cooper and Attorney General Josh Stein have withdrawn the state’s petition for a high court review of a <a href="http://abc11.com/politics/cooper-stein-ask-supreme-court-to-end-voter-id-review/1765696/">voter ID law</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Texas:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge Orland Garcia has <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/judge-sanctions-texas-voter-registration-case/I175rjIui57PdNqpSANjZJ/">sanctioned the state of Texas</a> for disregarding court orders to provide documents in a lawsuit over the state’s voter registration practices. According to the Austin American-Statesman, the judge said the months-long delay wasted time and money and was disruptive to the case. He also singled out the attorney general’s office for deficient performance.</p>
<p>Also in Texas, the 13th Court of Appeals has stayed a lower court’s ruling pending an appeal which <a href="http://valleycentral.com/news/local/13th-court-of-appeals-halts-hidalgos-plan-to-hold-a-special-election">puts a special city council election in Hidalgo on hold</a> for the time being. The election had been scheduled for March 6.</p>
