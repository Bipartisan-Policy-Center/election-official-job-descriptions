							<h2>In Focus This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>I. In Focus This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elections officials nationwide deal with voters’ calls about data request</strong><br /><em>Some just want more information, others want to unregister</em></p>
<p>By <a href="mailto:mmoretti@electionline.org">M. Mindy Moretti<br /></a>Electionline.org</p>
<p>The calls to the <a href="https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-elections-divison.html">Denver Elections</a> office began on July 5, the day after the nation celebrated the 241st anniversary of its independence. Right away the office realized the magnitude of what was happening.</p>
<p>Before the week was over the office had seen more than a twenty-fold increase in voters seeking to withdraw their voter registration.</p>
<p>“To see more people withdrawing in a day than new registrations is certainly something that I never expected to see in my over-12-years of administering elections,” Amber McReynolds, director of elections in Denver recently <a href="http://kosu.org/post/denver-voters-withdraw-registrations-response-trumps-data-request">told</a> NPR. [See Our Say for an op-ed by McReynolds.}</p>
<p>Blue state, red state, swing state, elections officials nationwide have been fielding phone calls and emails — as well as questions via social media — from voters concerned about the recent request for voter data from the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/11/presidential-executive-order-establishment-presidential-advisory">President’s Advisory Commission on Election Integrity</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.capecounty.us/County%20Clerk%20Home.aspx">Cape Girardeau County, Missouri</a>, County Clerk Kara Clark Summers said her office has received several calls regarding the data request. She said citizens are concerned about their sensitive information being distributed and that how they voted may lead to junk mail and harassing phone calls.</p>
<p>“A few registered voters have inquired about being removed from the voter registration rolls,” Clark Summers said. “We are advising them of Missouri laws. We have also advised them to contact the Missouri secretary of state’s office if they have questions about what information was released by state.”</p>
<p>Clark Summers said that none of the people her office has spoken with chose to unregister after finding out more information.</p>
<p>“The calls take time away from our daily business, but it’s important to me and our staff that our voters get cored and informed information regarding their voter registration,” Clark Summers said.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/elections.aspx">King County, Washington</a> has received a handful of calls from voters expressing concerns about their voter data being released. Kafia Hosh, spokeswoman for the county elections department said those calls are being referred to the secretary of state’s office.</p>
<p>“We have received a small number of requests from voters to cancel their voter registration,” Hosh said. “We normally explain the process on cancelling their registration and also let them know about what data is publically available. After this information, it’s up to the voter if they want to stay registered. We give them a better understanding of the process to allow them to make an informed decision on if they want to stay registered.”</p>
<p>Karen Loschiavo, spokeswoman for <a href="https://recorder.maricopa.gov/elections/">Maricopa County, Arizona</a> said although they have received many inquiries about the data request, they have not seen a spike in people unregistering. Loschiavo said that once people understand what information is being released their fears seem to be allayed. She noted that most people seem concerned that who they voted for will be made public information.</p>
<p>Loschaivo pointed out that the office has also received some calls supporting the request.</p>
<p>“We have received a high volume of people reaching out about the data request. The majority have been people demanding their data remain private,” Loschiavo said. “We had just three people that I know of that asked us to comply.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the calls the elections division in <a href="http://www.co.black-hawk.ia.us/190/Elections">Black Hawk County, Iowa</a> has received have been more curiosity than anything else, said Amy Jensen.</p>
<p>“They haven’t been angry or rude, they just think it’s not right to send their personal information,” Jensen said. “One lady mentioned the information was being sent via email, so not very safe. I’m actually surprised we haven’t received more visits/phone calls.”</p>
<p>Jensen said one person has walked into the office to cancel their registration and another has requested information about unregistering be sent to her via the mail.</p>
<p>Back in Missouri, <a href="http://www.stlouisco.com/YourGovernment/Elections">St. Louis County</a> Democratic Director of Elections Eric Frey said they’ve received about a dozen calls, but doesn’t think that anyone has actually followed through with unregistering yet.</p>
<p>“Interestingly one of our county circuit judges called me and asked to be ‘taken off the list.’ After I explained everything mentioned above and that circuit judges must be registered voters in order to have their job, she backed off of that request as well,” Frey said. </p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/misc/usapolls/us170621_PBS_NPR/NPR_PBS%20NewsHour_Marist%20Poll_National%20Nature%20of%20the%20Sample%20and%20Tables_Democracy_Trust_July%202017.pdf">Marist/NPR/PBS poll</a> found that only 35 percent of registered voters in the country feel that elections are fair. While the poll was conducted before the data request was made, some elections officials see the writing on the wall about voter confidence in the process.</p>
<p>“This whole debacle is causing an unnecessary politicization of elections administration which is not warranted or appropriate. Elections Officials work hard to instill voter confidence and this issue is having the opposite effect,” said Brian Corley, <a href="http://www.pascovotes.com/">Pasco County, Florida</a> supervisor of elections.</p>
<p>Corley’s office has received more than 50 calls/visits to their offices and emails about the data request. He said the commonality of the voter outreach has been concern, frustration, anger, et cetera over personal information being sent.</p>
<p>“The issue has caused an awakening among voters to just how much of their personal information is publicly available online,” Corley said.</p>
<p>Kevin Hall, communications director for <a href="https://sos.iowa.gov/">Iowa Secretary of State</a> Paul Pate echoed that sentiment. He said the secretary’s office has received a fair amount of calls and emails, but that it appears a major part of the problem is people understanding what the commission is requesting.</p>
<p>“A major part of the problem is that people do not understand that a lot of the data being requested is already publicly available,” Hall said. “Many expressed concerns that information regarding who they voted for in an election would be released. Of course, we don’t have that information and would never release it if we did.”</p>
<p>In Florida, the number of Pasco voters who have actually unregistered has been low. </p>
<p>“For the voters who will personally speak to me, I&#8217;ve convinced all but one to remain an active voter, which is ironically enough rewarding but also saddening to have make such a plea!” Corley said.</p>
<p>While no one can predict what impact the data request may have on registration numbers and turnout in 2018, Corley does see at least one upside to the request in Florida.</p>
<p>“Being an eternal optimist, I&#8217;m pleased to relay that an upside to the myriad of concerned voters contacting me has led to a chance to speak to the merits of ERIC &amp; this can only help our legislative endeavors next session,” he said.</p>

							<h2>Our Say</h2>
														<p><strong>II. Our Say</strong></p>
<p><strong>Regarding the request to states for voter info</strong></p>
<p>Amber F. McReynolds<br />Director of Elections for the City and City and County of Denver</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AmberHeadShot.jpg" alt="AmberHeadShot" style="margin: 5px; border: 1px none #000000; float: right;" width="236" height="353" />I have administered elections in the City and County of Denver for over 12 years and our team has made it our mission to improve the voting experience for all eligible citizens by creating innovative solutions to better serve customers and improve operations. We come to work every day excited about the responsibility and opportunity to serve as election officials. For us, it is about administering one of the most sacred and essential rights we have as Americans.</p>
<p>We have tirelessly worked to make voter registration more efficient and convenient to encourage civic engagement.</p>
<p>I never expected to come to work and see such a sudden increase in voter registration withdrawals. I never expected to see more withdrawals in a day than new registrations.</p>
<p>The impact on voters is real.&nbsp;&nbsp; The impact on civic engagement is real. The impact on election offices is real. Colorado has the highest registration rate as a percentage of population and if this week’s trend continues that could quickly change. Here is the breakdown in Denver since Monday July 3rd, ironically the day before our nation celebrated its independence: (the percentage increase compares the same types of voter transactions over the same number of days during the week of June 26.)</p>
<ul>
<li>2,150 percent increase in voter registration withdrawals.</li>
<li>1,833 percent increase in walk-in transactions with voters.</li>
<li>790 percent increase email communications from voters.</li>
<li>247 percent increase in phone calls from voters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a sampling of voter comments:</p>
<p>“It seems like an assault on our personal freedoms – of speech and privacy first and foremost.”</p>
<p>“I have concerns that my individually-identifiable information would be misused for illegitimate purposes.&nbsp; I sincerely hope that the Denver Elections Division does not support, or respond to, any such requests involving private information in the future.”</p>
<p>“I am sending this email to state my objection to providing any private information to the commission, should the Denver Elections Division (or the Colorado Secretary of State) be pressured in the future to provide such information.”</p>
<p>“Again, thank you for your efforts in protecting our voting integrity. &nbsp;What we are also gravely concerned about is the follow-up letter coming from the DOJ. &nbsp;Their demand seems very ominous. &nbsp;Will our confidential forms protect us from their demands? &nbsp;It appears that the DOJ may have more clout against the states who want to protect voting rights.”</p>
<p>“I am officially requesting that you DO NOT release my name to the federal government, in terms of my act of voting, or my voting record, or any information at all. &nbsp;Voting should remain a citizen’s private duty, and there is no need to do this. “&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Due to the decision to have my information given without my permission, I would like to have the form sent to me that allows me to unregister as a voter. &nbsp;Please send ASAP.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m afraid to withdraw my voter registration because some law or rule may change in the interim that won’t allow me to register again.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I appreciate that you are handling this matter thoughtfully and with the best interest of Colorado voters in mind.”</p>
<p>According to a recent Pew Research Center study, the top three rights that Americans view as essential to their freedom are the freedom of speech, the right to vote, and the right to privacy. It is understandable that Americans are concerned about this situation.</p>
<p>The Denver Elections Division has fought to modernize election processes and conduct fair, accurate, secure, transparent, efficient elections for our voters. As this issue plays out, it is imperative that the voices of voters and the professionals who are responsible for the day-to-day conduct of elections are heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p>

							<h2>Election News This Week</h2>
														<p><strong>III. Election News This Week</strong></p>
<p><strong>The National Association of Secretaries of State met in Indianapolis</strong> earlier this week and while the White House’s request for voter data was a major topic of conversation, so too was <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-state-election-conference-20170708-story.html">cybersecurity</a>. According to the Chicago Tribune, secretaries of state voiced their frustration by the lack of information from federal intelligence officials on allegations of Russian interference with the 2016 election. &#8220;Over 20 states have been hampered with in some fashion, but no one seems to know what states they are, which means the Department of Homeland Security has not shared that information,&#8221; <a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/politics/gov-elections-states-federalism-trump.html">says</a> Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate. &#8220;We&#8217;re still a little frustrated on that count.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ten percent of the North Carolina</strong> <a href="http://www.reflector.com/News/2017/07/13/Ten-percent-of-county-election-boards-including-Pitt-have-empty-seats.html"><strong>county boards of elections</strong> cannot conduct business</a> because they lack the required number of members. The 3-member boards have had someone step down and that person cannot be replaced because the governor is currently locked in a legal battle over how county boards of elections are chosen. Boards of elections are doing the best they can to prepare for upcoming elections. “This is all behind the scenes, it&#8217;s not going to affect the voters. It&#8217;s just headaches for those of us in the office,” Dave&nbsp;Davis, Pitt County elections director told <em>The Reflector</em>. “Voters are going to be able to vote.” “The boards with two members cannot hold meetings because they cannot make quorum,” said Patrick Gannon, a spokesman with the State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement. “Counties without three members are directed to follow their usual business practices as to all matters that do not require a direct vote of the board.”</p>
<p><strong>St. Louis conducted its <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/navarro-wins-aldermanic-race-that-put-state-s-new-photo/article_46b3a9e2-8a46-53e3-8aca-393db00a5d9c.html">first election under the state’s new voter photo ID law</a></strong> this week and according to published reports, while there was some confusion, there were no major problems stemming from the new law. Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft happened to be visiting a polling place when a voter arrived without ID and according to the <em>St. Louis Post Dispatch</em>, he informed the voter about the provisional ballot process. Some voters told the <em>Post-Dispatch</em> they were confused or nervous as they waited to cast their ballots, unsure if the identification they brought was sufficient. Ashcroft had <a href="https://www.stl.news/ashcroft-praises-poll-workers/32090/">high praise</a> for poll workers and elections officials. Advocates had tried to block the implementation of the law before the election weren’t successful. “We weren’t throwing stones at Ashcroft. He didn’t have the money to do it,” Denise Lieberman of the Advancement Project told the paper. “But inadequate education and inadequate worker training leaves people in a state of confusion. What happens when voters get confused is they stay home.”</p>
<p><strong>Officials in Missoula County, Montana are at odds</strong> with the secretary of state’s office over assertions by Secretary Corey Stapleton that voter fraud is a problem in the county. Of the 47,000 ballots cast in Missoula County during the recent special election<a href="http://missoulian.com/news/local/elections-dustup-prompts-response-from-missoula-county-commissioners/article_36f47083-4093-5a9c-a947-4b805931e5f6.html">, 91 were rejected as fraudulent but only one was incorrectly counted</a>. The miscounted ballot was ultimately found and voided. The county reported that one case, not all 91 to the Missoula Police Department and the secretary of state’s office. “That’s where things got somewhat bizarre,” County Attorney Matt Jennings told the Missoulian. “We didn’t know the magnitude that the Secretary of State was treating this with until we received a press release saying they were treating this as fraud.” A heated email exchange ensued with the county questioning why it was being singled out when other counties had hundreds of rejected ballots. County commissioners has sent a letter to the secretary defending their elections office and seeking an explanation for the office’s assertions.</p>

							<h2>Fed-State Update</h2>
														<p><strong>IV. Fed-State Update</strong></p>
<p>With several lawsuits pending, this week the President’s Advisory Commission on Election Integrity <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/trump-voting-panel-tells-states-to-hold-off-sending-data-while-court-weighs-privacy-impact/2017/07/10/c4c837fa-6597-11e7-a1d7-9a32c91c6f40_story.html?utm_term=.31eb77253267">put on hold its request for voter data</a> from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The White House said it would delete the information provided by Arkansas—the only state to so far submit the requested data.</p>
<p>Although the request is currently on hold, there is still a lot of news about it this week, here is a look at just some of it.</p>
<p><strong>Capitol Hill</strong><br />On Capitol Hill, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia) has written a <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/341570-dem-rep-asks-pence-to-stop-voter-fraud-commissions-request-for-sensitive-data">letter to Vice President Mike Pence</a> asking him to quash the commission’s request for voter data.</p>
<p>&#8220;This extensive order risks compromising the privacy&nbsp;of millions of Americans&#8217; personal information, potentially violates several federal statutes, paves the way for illegal purging of voter rolls, and is based on false claims made by President Trump and members of his administration,&#8221; Connolly wrote according to The Hill.</p>
<p>Also on Capitol Hill, Democrats in both the House and Senate have introduced the Anti-Voter Suppression Act that would <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/07/12/democrats-aim-block-funding-trumps-election-commission/474045001/">block federal funding</a> for the president’s election commission.</p>
<p>“It would be highly irresponsible for senators or congressional members to remain silent,’’ Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) said at the bills unveiling. “It is just and right that at a time when we see, I think, efforts to undermine the most basic Constitutional rights, which is the right to vote and participate in this democracy, that no Senator, that no House member should be silent.”</p>
<p><strong>Federal Court<br /></strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/white-house-voter-fraud-lawsuits-kris-kobach.html?_r=0">Three separate federal lawsuits</a> have been filed against the election commission’s request for data. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, The American Civil Liberties Union and Public Citizen have all filed suit.</p>
<p>In addition, the Electronic Privacy Information Center filed suit last week.</p>
<p><strong>District of Columbia</strong><br />The Council of the District of Columbia has voted unanimously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-council-votes-to-withhold-voter-data-from-white-house-commission/2017/07/11/a1ca508e-6660-11e7-8eb5-cbccc2e7bfbf_story.html?utm_term=.004a5f79b654">to reject the White House’s request for voter data</a>. The bill makes it illegal for the D.C. Board of Elections to provide the presidential commission with information about voters other than what is already publicly available.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii</strong><br />In last week’s update, Hawaii was the only state with no information about how it would handle the voter data request. This week we have learned that, according to state elections officials, it will be <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/35861514/state-counties-must-decide-whether-to-ok-trumps-voter-records-request">up each of Hawaii’s county governments</a> to determine what voter data to send, if any at all.</p>
<p><strong>Idaho</strong><br />The Idaho Democratic Party has filed a lawsuit seeking a <a href="http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/jul/11/idaho-dems-sue-to-block-release-of-voter-info-to-t/'">temporary restraining order</a> preventing Secretary of State Lawerence Denney from sending any voter data to the White House commission. “No one, absolutely no one in Idaho has ever said they wished more of their private information would fall into the hands of hackers, or telemarketers, or even the federal government,” said Bert Marley, state party chairman. “While Secretary Denney has indicated that he may not send all of the information the Trump commission wants, he simply failed to offer assurances that this is even a legal request or that the information will be safeguarded and kept private.” The suit argues that the request violates the state’s public records law.</p>
<p><strong>Indiana</strong><br />The Brennan Center for Justice, the Indiana League of Women Voters and the Indiana chapter of the NAACP have <a href="http://wbaa.org/post/lawsuit-seeks-block-release-indiana-voter-information#stream/0">filed suit against Secretary of State Connie Lawson</a> in an attempt to stop the release of voter data to the White House panel. The suit is based on Indiana law which allows for the release of some voter data, but prevents the recipient from sharing that information other than for political or fundraising activities. The White House commission has said it will make the voter data public.</p></p>
