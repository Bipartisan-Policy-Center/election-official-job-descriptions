Fair Elections Center also began WorkElections.org to address a struggle that many local election officials face: recruiting a sufficient number of poll workers – particularly those with in-demand technological and language skills, to help voters on Election Day. The online tool collects poll worker requirements and applications for thousands of jurisdictions across the country, providing a central source of simplified information for interested individuals who may not know how or where to apply.  WorkElections seeks to facilitate poll worker recruitment to ensure that this year’s elections go as smoothly as possible. This position brings these two projects of Fair Elections Center together to further the missions of both: 1) by recruiting a pool of poll workers that are more representative of the communities they will serve, and  2) reducing barriers to student voting and welcoming more young voters into the democratic process.

The Elections Performance Index conducted by MIT has ranked Vermont in the top states in the nation for statewide election administration. In recent years, the Division has implemented significant changes in election policy to increase access to elections for Vermonters, including automatic voter registration, election day registration, online voter registration, expanded early voting, online accessible ballot marking, and, most recently, the mailing of ballots to all active registered voters for General Elections. While these advancements have been positive for Vermonters, it has added complexity for the Elections team and election officials across the state. Simultaneously, the profile of elections has shifted dramatically with increased emphasis on cybersecurity, disinformation, technology, and data. As a result, elections have been under the microscope like never before with increased attention from the public and the press. The Director will advise the Secretary of State, lead an experienced team, and will be expected to bring a vision, new ideas, and new solutions to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving profile of election administration. The Elections Division engages in continual improvement processes and requires that all staff contribute to policy and operations development. If you thrive in a fast-paced environment driven by immutable deadlines with multiple demands, have a commitment to excellence, and desire to ensure voting remains the cornerstone of democracy this is the right opportunity for you.

2023,03-09,"Philanthropy-Organizer Consultant RFP, Nonproft VOTE— Nonprofit VOTE is seeking an experienced consultant to act as the organizer and facilitator for the Philanthropy for Voter Engagement Initiative. This Initiative seeks to mobilize foundations to support voter engagement among their grantees and within their communities, both directly through grantmaking and indirectly through their actions. This Initiative is not about fundraising for any particular organization, but rather resourcing and supporting critical voter engagement work at nonprofits across the nation. Funding within the voter engagement space is often cyclical and narrowly focused on groups that do voter engagement work almost exclusively. Such a strategy fails to provide needed consistency and underutilizes the vast nonprofit infrastructure already in place in communities around the nation, including food pantries, housing clinics, family service agencies, community-based organizations, advocacy groups, and other nonprofits that have long-standing, year-around relations with the communities they serve. The long-term goal of the Initiative is to foster a philanthropic system that consistently supports and resources voter engagement among their grantees and broader community. The immediate objective is to build upon work that Nonprofit VOTE conducted in partnership with various philanthropy serving organizations (PSOs) to produce the Voter Engagement Toolkit for Foundations (both private and community foundation editions) in 2018. The toolkit to be updated identifies common strategies from direct funding of voter engagement work to the hosting trainings and revising overly-restrictive grant language. As the toolkits make clear, a foundation need not be a civic engagement funder to support voter engagement. There are roles for health funders, housing funders, environmental funders and most other types of funders to support voter engagement in a way that enables them and their grantees to more effectively deliver on their missions and strengthen the communities they serve. The Initiative consultant will work in close partnership with Nonprofit VOTE’s executive director and other key staff. Deadline: March 15.
